Chronic pain sufferer Francesca James, 27, says the clinic is a fresh start for her. “It been a nightmare. This is a godsend ... my life sucked before cannabis,” she said. A consultation at a new clinic in Subiaco can prescribe the medicinal cannabis she used to import illegally. But the process not as simple as many think. You have to be referred to the clinic by a GP. After a 45-minute consultation the doctor decides if medicinal cannabis is suitable for a patient. But before they can prescribe medicinal cannabis permission needs be given by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and WA Health Department. That can take up to a month. If permission is granted the clinic can write a prescription which patients take to a pharmacy which then has to order it, usually in oil form. Not only is it hard to obtain medicinal cannabis it is also expensive. It is not on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme so patients must pay the full price. Depending on the dosage — the average is about $300 to $350 a month. But for long-time sufferers like Ms James it is worth the expense. “This is her chance to get her life back,” Dr Berenice Blakemore, of Cannabis Access Clinics, said.","Dec 12, 2018 ...

As always, all is not as it seems. So far, it means nothing for most and only offers a thread of hope for a chosen few. These steps are more like marching on the spot than moving forward. At a distance, it looks effective, but in reality it is all just for show. And what a show governments have put on: there was a sparkly announcement last year that the Queensland Government would be involved in a single trial of testing the efficacy of medicinal cannabis on children with severe epilepsy. Then the Federal Government said it would take steps to decriminalise the growing of the wonder plant for medical purposes. Now the state says our laws, if and when they are eventually drafted, debated, voted on and enacted, will be the most progressive in the country and will open new industries and help the sick and dying. But so far — nothing. It smacks of 2003, when then NSW premier Bob Carr and then PM John Howard announced four years of medicinal cannabis clinical trials. They never happened. Importantly, nothing has changed for the many already using medicinal cannabis oil and spray. No lifeline has been extended, no amnesty offered to create secure and legal lines of supply during the many years it will take for the tiniest changes to be made. Pertinently, the talk around medicinal cannabis has all been around working with pharmaceutical companies. This is a product that already has experts making it. It is already helping those willing to step outside the law. And it is most effective when as close to its natural state as possible — no pill press, boxing conveyor belt or assembly line required.  All the Government needs to do is to legitimise and embrace the covert industry and its knowledge, not focus solely on legislation and economy ahead of health. Last month, in response to a parliamentary e-petition to change the law to free up access to medicinal cannabis for those who need it now, Health Minister Cameron Dick reiterated that cannabis in all forms is illegal. The Government is therefore being churlish and misleading in saying that they want to make medicinal cannabis available to more sick people. They could do that now, but they haven’t. And they are wrong in indicating that the move on Tuesday will legally put medicinal cannabis under the tongues of Queenslanders who are sick or dying: the only thing it changes is that it lays out a possible legal route in which the state’s chief medical officer can give permission to individuals to be part of specific clinical trials. That will not change the status quo — and too bad for the dying, who do not have time to wait for the world to change.  Dick said individuals who wanted to access medicinal cannabis now could apply to the Federal Government’s Therapeutic Goods Administration under its Special Access Scheme. Just how many people have done that and how many were approved is unknown, but I would wager the answer is none. The healing properties within the cannabis plant have been embraced for thousands of years. It has forever been food, clothing and medicine. The Declaration of Independence was drafted on hemp paper and early American flags were made from hemp cloth.  Its status was changed by magicians who turned the life-giving wonder plant into a demonic danger right before the public’s eyes 100 years ago.  We were all robbed of nature’s nutritious, healing gift, in all its forms. I bought some hulled hemp seed at a natural food store the other day. Hemp seed is a complete vegetable protein, perfect for an active person like me. Stuck on the front of the packaging is a warning that hemp seed has not been approved for human consumption in Australia and New Zealand. We are islands in this — the rest of the world uses it as a key food for exercisers.  More action and less talk is required. We must shift out thinking, offer an amnesty to those already making medicinal cannabis and those who will use it before any legislative wheels might start turning. Medicinal cannabis can do no harm. And we must have legal steps that make medicinal cannabis available to more than just a handful on a specific clinical trial. Otherwise, the Government must stop hinting that medicinal cannabis will be Queensland farmers’ saving grace and broad hope for the sick and dying and, instead, be honest about it being pharmaceutical companies’ future new cash cow.

Her appeal to Mr Turnbull follows the raid on the house of an Adelaide woman who produces and supplies medicinal cannabis oil for free to terminally ill patients around Australia. Senator Hanson appealed to One Nation supporters to lobby the Prime Minister to support an amnesty for medicinal cannabis users and suppliers. “Most of you know I’ve been a long advocate of Medicinal Cannabis, due to its effective relief for so many ailments, conventional drugs can’t offer,” Ms Hanson posted on her Facebook page. “I can reveal yesterday, I appealed directly to the Prime Minister to intervene and give amnesty to users and suppliers of this vital life saving drug so many people and families are no longer forced to use this in secret.” Senator Hanson called for the politicians across Australia to follow the lead of the Labor Government and LNP opposition in Queensland, who in a bipartisan agreement last year, passed legislation to allow patients to access medicinal cannabis.  She called on the Prime Minister to look at federal legislation to allow for legal suppliers to operate within the law. “My understanding is, there is no legal supplier at present in Australia and hence the police raid on this supplier,” she wrote. South Australian police raided the northern Adelaide home of Jenny Hallam last Wednesday morning and seized products and equipment related to the production of cannabis oil. A long-time advocate for medicinal cannabis, Ms Hallam supplies her cannabis oil to the sick and terminally ill all across Australia. Senator Hanson said anyone who backs new medicinal cannabis legislation should contact the Prime Minister. “Please show your support and let’s lobby the Prime Minister to intervene and help save these families. I’m sure his office would appreciate your call tomorrow on (02) 9327 3988.  “Be nice, though, we want his support! “I thank all politicians who have got behind this cause and ask those who haven’t, raise your white flag on party politics for a moment and lets work together to give these people some help in a time of need.” Senator Hanson and Mr Turnbull have been contacted for further comment.

About one in three Australians has regular difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep, and researchers believe the sedation effect brought on by medicinal cannabis could be an alternative treatment to prescription medication. UWA study lead Professor Peter Eastwood said 24 adults have been selected for the study. “Medicinal cannabis is a big issue, and it’s been in the news a lot lately; this trial will provide the first evidence-based answers on whether it works in people with insomnia,” he said. “It could be a game changer, not just for people with insomnia.” Prof Eastwood said many prescription medications have unpleasant side effects, with previous research indicating medicinal cannabis would have fewer side effects. Participants will put medicinal cannabis or a placebo in an oil formulation under the tongue one hour before going to bed, with one night spent in the UWA Centre for Sleep Science and the rest of the two weeks spent at home with a wrist-based activity monitor to measure sleep quality. The process will be repeated with the second formulation for the double-blind placebo crossover trial. The cannabinoid extract will be provided by Zelda Therapeutics, a medicinal cannabis research company. Results are expected by the end of this year.

It comes amid proposed new laws for the state which would allow to users to drive with the drug detectable in their system. The bill was introduced to the upper house on Wednesday by members of the Legalise Cannabis Party which nabbed two seats at the last election. Among the changes to the Road Safety act would include it no longer being an offence for otherwise unimpaired drivers to have detectable tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in their blood or oral fluid. TCH is the primary psychoactive substance from cannabis. Dr Karen Hitchcock, who works as a GP specialising in medicinal cannabis, said Victoria’s current laws were pushing patients towards other prescription drugs. “I am referred patients with insomnia, often to assist them to withdraw from addictive drugs with overdose potential – benzodiazepines such as valium and temazepam, opiates, antipsychotics such as quetiapine, and hypnotics,” she said. Dr Hitchcock said a dose of cannabis oil before bed is “often all that is required” to treat symptoms but this can stay in a driver’s system after “the effects of the cannabis have long abated”. “Unfortunately by morning, the patient may still have traces of THC in their saliva, and it may be detected in their blood for weeks,” she said. “Many patients choose to stay on their more dangerous and more addictive medications because of the driving laws. Others take a risk, as the relief and increase in quality of life now that they are sleeping soundly are worth the risk of losing their licence. Dr Hitchcock went on to say the current laws could cause pain-stricken drivers to become a danger on the roads due to a lack of sleep. “Sleep deprivation, we know, grossly impairs driving ability. It is time the laws were changed to reflect the reality that cannabis is a medicine,” she said. “It is time we stopped mistaking innocent citizens for criminals”. Legalise Cannabis Victoria MP David Ettershank, who represents the Western Metropolitan region, said the laws should be focused on impairment, not just THC being present. “People who have been prescribed a medicine and can drive safely should be allowed to drive – this is how we treat every single prescription medicine in Victoria, except medicinal cannabis, and it’s time for that to be corrected,” he said. “Testing for the sheer presence of THC rather than impairment is not right. This failure is based on stigma rather than evidence and the law for cannabis needs to be brought in line with all other prescription medicines.” Currently, Tasmania is the only state which provides a medical defence for driving with the presence of THC in bodily fluids. This is only applicable if the medicinal cannabis is obtained and administered in accordance with state laws. In response to a Bill on the issue in 2019, the Victorian government established the Medicinal Cannabis and Safe Driving Working Group and commissioned research into its potential impact.

Cassie Batten and Rhett Wallace discharged their son Cooper from The Northern Hospital in Epping before the cannabis could be confiscated. They now feel they have nowhere to turn because doctors refuse to use the drug on hospital grounds. It is the first time the family has been prepared to reveal the name of the hospital that has been supporting the use of the cannabis oil and tincture for the treatment of the three-year-old’s life-threatening seizures. Hospital records show staff at The Northern previously included cannabis oil on Cooper’s drug chart. PREVIOUSLY: Parents face questions over marijuana treatment But staff yesterday called off their support. Hospital spokesman Ryan Brown said: “it is inappropriate for The Northern Hospital to comment on a patient’s health or well being. It is, however, Northern Hospital policy not to condone the administration of an illegal substance”. One of the hospital’s lawyers last night tried negotiating with Mr Wallace, who admitted to becoming emotional during a meeting with staff. “They (the hospital) said they would call the police and confiscate the cannabis. “Out of respect we have not intended to release the name of the hospital but now we feel we have no choice, we believe he could go downhill.” The parents acknowledged removing Cooper was against medical advice. “Our opinion is that he should be in hospital, but if he can’t have the cannabis oil then he is going to go backwards,” Mr Wallace said. “We would rather take the risk of the short-term illness, try to manage it at home, than the risk of brain damage which is what happens every time he has a seizure.” Mr Wallace and Ms Batten said they had rushed Cooper to emergency about 11.30am after he developed a fever and became dehydrated. “Like any person, we don’t want police involvement but we will go to any length for Cooper, ,” Mr Wallace said. The parents called state politicians from the hospital ward last night. Both parties have previously vowed to overhaul the law and allow the clinical trials of medicinal cannabis.  “We’re stuck in a solution where both major political parties are willing to support it in future but we need a solution here and now, for Cooper’s sake,” Mr Wallace said. andrea.hamblin@news.com.au Originally published as Police fears over cannabis treatment","Sep 29, 2014 ...

Though don’t expect to see fields of cannabis plants on the city’s fringes because the “discreet” and “hard to access” facilities will employ military-style security to keep intruders out. WA-based companies AusCann and MGC Pharma both want to cultivate and manufacture medicinal cannabis here. AusCann said it would this week lodge a licence application to grow the drug at a secret site near Perth. MGC Pharma isn’t far behind. Ideal weather conditions mean WA is well-placed to get a slice of the legal market. On Friday, the Federal Office of Drug Control said three applications were under assessment, but wouldn’t disclose if any were from WA. Applications were invited from November 1. The regulator this week issued security guidelines. Companies intending to cultivate crops with a high concentration of tetrahydro- cannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component of cannabis, are required to erect “two-layer perimeters such as building walls or climb-proof fencing” to keep out intruders. They will also need to install CCTV and alarms. And destruction or disposal of any materials will require “monitored incineration or other tracked destruction”. AusCann managing director Elaine Darby said it might take a couple of months for the company to get its licence. The company has detailed site plans, but is not allowed to identify its location. Ms Darby said the site, which would be used for cultivation and manufacture, isn’t far from Perth. “Logistically, that is not appropriate (to be far from Perth),” she said. “There has to be physical security ... we are going over the final plans. “We have a lot of fairly good technology solutions where we can make sure the site is monitored 24-7.” She said the company had engaged security company Lockforce International. “They are very experienced when it comes to the protection of high-value products,” Ms Darby said. MGC Pharma executive chairman Brett Mitchell said the Perth-based company “was finalising plans for where to base growing operations”. WA also offered the best climatic conditions to grow medicinal cannabis, he said. “The board is very strongly in favour at the moment to establish an operation here in WA. It will be dependent on getting the right government support and local support to make it happen,” he added. Mr Mitchell said security was high on the list of priorities. They would draw on the experience of managing director Nativ Segev, formerly chief executive of Israel’s second-biggest medical cannabis company. “Operating in Israel, security protocols are are extremely strict,” he said. “It’s almost like (operating) a military base.” Part of the application process involves the regulator vetting the board members and employees of applicants. “Someone who has recently spent time in prison for drug offences would be unlikely to meet this requirement,” the regulator said. AusCann has two former Liberal MPs on its board — former federal politician Mal Washer and former WA environment minister Cheryl Edwardes. Mr Washer, a former GP, is Ms Darby’s father. The company, which aims to develop products to relieve neuropathic pain, last month formed a joint-venture with Chilean group Fundación Daya, which has a medical cannabis licence in Chile. AusCann recently sought $5 million via a public offer. “We were massively oversubscribed, there is so much interest in this space,” Ms Darby said. “This industry is just going to explode in the next two or three years,” Mr Mitchell added. “We have a doctor on our board, a leading cardiologist from Sydney, Dr Ross Walker, and he considers this to be the biggest revolution in the medical industry for 50 years. It is not a panacea and a cure all, it is a natural-based alternative medicine for key issues where the benefits are irrefutable with respect to post-chemo nausea, children with severe epilepsy, severe pain and palliative care.” JOELLE Neville is totally sold on medical cannabis, but not the laws that will exclude thousands of families who need it. The Maylands mum buys hemp oil from US company Elixinol to give to her 11-year-old epileptic daughter Ava, who has tuberous sclerosis, a rare genetic disease that causes benign tumours to grow in the brain. Hemp oil has been “absolutely life changing” for Ava and her family. She would previously experience up to 20 seizures a day. Expensive prescription medicines helped, but her transformation with Elixinol means she no longer needs them, saving taxpayers about $150,000 a year. But Elixinol, a psychoactive-free oil, is costing the Nevilles $10,000 a year. The moves to legalise medical cannabis in Australia won’t make a jot of difference to the Nevilles and families like them, they argue. Elixinol and other hemp oils will still be illegal to ingest. “It’s not going to help me at the moment and it’s not going to help 95 per cent of the people I know that are on versions of it for varying conditions,” she said. Ms Neville said the strains licensed companies could produce were too narrow and targeted only a few serious health conditions. “It may work for some people but it absolutely won’t work for all of the people who are currently benefiting from medicinal cannabis in its illegal form,” she said. “I have seen so many people now that respond to different strains. Some people require THC, some people don’t require it ... I don’t think that finding one or two pharmaceutical companies that can get it into one or two forms is going to be the miracle.” Paul Benhaim, chief executive of Elixinol and Hemp Foods Australia said medical cannabis did not need to be psychoactive. “We believe (governments) should allow the use of these non-psychoactive products much more widely because there have been many studies done on this material saying (cannabidiol) is non-toxic,” he said.","Dec 17, 2016 ...

At the Council of Australian Governments health council meeting in Sydney yesterday, Mr Cook and his State and Territory counterparts gave the nod to having a single approval process for all medicinal cannabis products to be managed by the Federal Therapeutic Goods Administration. The deal means patients will no longer have to apply to both State and Federal authorities if their doctors recommend they use the drug for treatment purposes. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said the change, which will see all jurisdictions adopt the Commonwealth trial under way in NSW, would make doctors a “one-stop shop” for accessing medicinal cannabis after they make the decision to prescribe it. “The decision to prescribe will be rightly in the hands of medical professionals,” he said. “But once that decision is made, access will be provided within what we expect to be a 48-hour period. In some cases as low as 24 hours.” A WA-led proposal designed to remove barriers to registered health professionals receiving mental health treatment will also be adopted across the country after it was endorsed by the ministers. Mr Hunt said up until now there had been significant unintended barriers to doctors and nurses seeking help because of man-datory reporting requirements. He said patients would be protected by important provisions to be written into the legislation, which would be developed in consultation with medical professionals and the States.  “What has been agreed is a system that will both protect patients but, critically, also remove barriers to doctors and nurses receiving and accessing the mental health treatment that they want,” Mr Hunt said. Another proposal out of WA to consider lifting the legal age for purchasing cigarettes to 21 received a mixed response and was referred to the Australian Health Ministers’ Advisory Council for further study. In putting the change on the agenda, Mr Cook had hoped to spark discussion about raising the legal smoking age from 18 among his interstate colleagues and examine the challenges and obstacles.  He said any such change required a national approach.","Apr 13, 2018 ...

The announcement has reached more than 70,000 people on the social media network. Dr Olufemi Obadimeji (Dr Femi) is a GP with the Baldivis Family Medical Centre. He said despite being anti-illicit drugs, patient suffering was the catalyst that changed his mind. “First time I looked closely at it was through a patient with Crohn’s who requested medicinal cannabis,” he said. “I was hesitant – due to the negative effects of cannabis in its pure form and because of the different schools of thought on it. “But the patient had asked their specialist who agreed for an application to be submitted on their behalf. “Around the same time I attended a product marketing seminar on medicinal cannabis. “Doctors and specialists spoke of their experience with it, the legislation around it, its use in other countries and how it worked for pain management.” He said due to its relationship to recreational cannabis and ‘getting high’, the government had put in safeguards to ensure it was not abused. “I have had four requests for it so far,” Dr Femi said. “One patient smokes cannabis for mild back pain and insomnia and wanted a legal way to procure it. “His story did not match what I would have expected for a genuine case for medicinal cannabis so I did not investigate it further. “Another patient had terminal bowel cancer and is in terrible pain. “She needs quality of life to spend the rest of her time with her children and husband so she can live peacefully. “Two other patients – a child with constant headaches, twitches and fainting from brain lesions and another patient with chronic pain syndrome and inflammatory spondylitis – are also genuine cases for medicinal cannabis.” Dr Femi said there were layers to the process. “First the patient must ask me and already be under treatment for their condition by a specialist in that particular field,” he said. “I will listen to their case and if they could benefit then I will discuss it with their specialist. “If the specialist agrees that it will help, then there are discussions with the WA Health Department before I apply to the Federal Government in Canberra on the patients behalf.” “Hence even though I apply for a patient the final approval lies with the panel of doctors in Canberra.”","Jul 25, 2018 ...

Mr McGowan and Health Minister Roger Cook will chair a meeting with medical leaders next month to encourage them to prescribe cannabis to people suffering from debilitating and painful illnesses or terminal diseases. The premier said on Sunday that medicinal cannabis was an alternative for people who did not want to use morphine-related drugs to ease their pain. He said for years he had thought it bizarre to see sick people charged with smoking cannabis if they had arthritis or were terminally ill. Mr McGowan conceded some doctors did not support medicinal cannabis, but there were thousands of patients who wanted it.Since November, cannabis-based products could be legally prescribed under strict regulations. As of March, 45 applications to cultivate or manufacture the drug have been received, including six from WA. Importation of cannabis-based products by an authorised health practitioner is possible with Commonwealth approvals.

The companies hope to be granted licenses in the coming months and begin growing cannabis within a year. The law changes, which come into effect tomorrow, allow for fit and proper applicants to cultivate and produce cannabis as medicine or for research.  It follows a move earlier this year in Victoria, where the law was also changed to allow for patients in “exceptional circumstances” to get access to locally produced medicinal marijuana as long as they are overseen by doctors.  A facility set up by the Andrews Government is already growing test crops prior to private company involvement, and children with severe epilepsy will be among the first able to access the new products from next year.  The combination of state and federal law changes have led to companies already developing products overseas contemplating a push into Australia.  Australian company MGC Pharmaceuticals, which already grows and manufactures medicinal cannabis overseas, will be applying for a license and is considering Victoria as a possible site. MGC director Dr Ross Walker said the industry would create an enormous number of jobs. “Clearly we are looking at places like Victoria - where you grow wine is a great place to grow medical marijuana and the Andrews Government has done a lot for the growth of medical cannabis,” Dr Walker said. “It’s been estimated that worldwide, once it is established, the medicinal cannabis industry is worth about $150 billion, so there are huge opportunities in the horticultural side and also the manufacturing part of it. “What is important to understand here is that no body is talking about smoking cannabis - it will be in a capsule form, topical form and possible some kind of inhalation.” Dr Walker said early tests indicated potential benefits for a range of conditions including cancer pain, epilepsy and dementia. “There’s some very good preliminary work going but wee need to do more research,” he said. “We are hopeful that we are granted a license by the federal government.” President of Canadian-based medical cannabis research company Tilray, Brendan Kennedy, told the Sunday Herald Sun it was likely there would be strong competition to enter the Australian market. “We are extremely interested. We have been following the developments in Australia closely,” he said.  “Obviously we are looking at Victoria, the first state to legalise medicinal cannabis.”  Mr Kennedy said it was a “complex” and very expensive exercise to set up a new operational facility, given the legal sensitivities and differences between what can be produced in different countries.  “I think there will be a very high failure rate in terms of business success (in Australia),” he said.  matthew.johnston@news.com.au  Originally published as Cannabis could be cash bonanza for Victoria","Oct 29, 2016 ...

Wesley Medical Research Institute neuropsychiatrist Philip Mosley will trial a medicinal cannabis product in 24 adults with severe Tourette syndrome – a disorder which begins in childhood and is characterised by involuntary movements and vocalisations.  Many people with the condition also experience anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. The condition is associated with bullying and poor academic performance in childhood and adolescence, and with unemployment and social isolation as an adult. Existing treatments include antipsychotic medications, which suppress involuntary movements, but they are also associated with severe side-effects, including weight gain and high cholesterol. Dr Mosley said deep brain stimulation was also effective in Tourette syndrome patients but it was costly and highly invasive, requiring surgery. “The people with Tourette syndrome who’ve had deep brain stimulation are doing well, but not everyone wants to have brain surgery,” he said.  Dr Mosley said he expected the medical cannabis trial to begin mid-year with a pharmaceutical product containing a mixture of cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) – two of the chemical compounds in cannabis. “We think it’s a combination of the two that will hit the sweet spot,” he said. Dr Mosley suspects THC alone may benefit Tourette syndrome patients. But because of concern about its psychoactive properties, which may increase anxiety and precipitate psychosis, he hoped that by adding CBD it would reduce the potential for harmful complications. The treatment will be given as a tablet or in liquid form. Dr Mosley said many doctors were unwilling to prescribe medicinal cannabis because “there’s very limited evidence for it for most conditions”. “I think doctors are rightly cautious,” he said. “I’m hoping that this trial, if it’s beneficial for this condition, will enable doctors to prescribe with more confidence if they have a patient with Tourette syndrome.” The trial has been made possible through a $100,000 grant from the Wesley Medical Research Institute.

Adelaide Cancer Centre oncologist Brian Stein said he had abandoned an attempt to complete the application process to provide the drug on a one-off basis and bemoaned the “arduous” process. Dr Stein said a shortage of data about how much of the drug should be used to treat different conditions and an inability to know exactly what doctors are prescribing were the main issues to overcome before he was comfortable prescribing medicinal cannabis. Dr Stein said he was approached by a cancer patient who was “very keen” to get a prescription to use medicinal cannabis, but she died before he completed the paperwork. If accredited under Special Access Scheme B, Dr Stein would have become South Australia’s second medical professional permitted to provide medicinal cannabis to a single patient. There are no South Australian “approved prescribers” of medicinal cannabis — medical professionals who are able to supply the drug to patients on a general basis.  Dr Stein stressed he had no designs on becoming the state’s first authorised prescriber: “I’m not interested in becoming Mr Medicinal Marijuana, but I will consider individual patient requests”. To prescribe cannabis in South Australia, a doctor must obtain the approval of the Therapeutic Goods Administration, as well as the state Drugs of Dependence Unit. Dr Stein said he had a “number of substantive issues” with DDU’s application process. “The unit want you to prove the drug you’re prescribing does something useful and the scientific evidence on medicinal marijuana is not particularly strong,” he said. “I don’t have a book that says if you have nausea, then you should take this much of this particular strain of the drug. If you look at it as a scientist, one of the biggest issues with medicinal marijuana is what are we prescribing? “It’s not me saying ‘I don’t believe this could be useful’, but I need evidence to make regulators happy and evidence to make me happy that one patient will get the same stuff as the patient that came before them.” Greens MLC Tammy Franks said Dr Stein’s comments bolstered the case for controlled growing and testing of medicinal cannabis. “Doctors need to be given some guarantees about what they’re prescribing. They’re also given no protections and given no support and training,” she said. A spokesman for Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said a medical practitioner could receive TGA approval to provide cannabis within four days by filling out a one-page Special Access Scheme B form. “States and territories have their own legislation around access to medicinal cannabis, including what type of practitioner can prescribe,” the spokesman said. “Creating a more consistent approach to patient access to medicinal cannabis is something the minister raised at COAG Health Council last week.” Originally published as ‘Too hard’ to get medicinal cannabis permission","Mar 30, 2017 ...

Australia’s health regulator warned consumers on Monday that products bought on the internet may be unsafe, of poor quality or contain a different dose to what the label claims. While fake products mimic authentic goods, the Therapeutic Goods Administration said they could contain undeclared dangerous ingredients. The lack of manufacturing and testing standards could also lead to the products being contaminated. The TGA said consumers should beware of buying medicine online, even though it might seem like a simple and affordable option. “Products bought over the internet may be a serious risk to your health and a waste of money,” the TGA said on Monday. “Products sold on the black market, especially from online sellers that do not request a doctor’s prescription, are unlikely to achieve the desired results and can be very dangerous. “Using fake products can put you at serious risk of unpredictable or severe adverse reactions.” Medicinal cannabis products generally contain CBD and/or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the psychoactive substance in cannabis. Australians can legally access medicinal cannabis if a registered doctor gives them a prescription, and the patient fills the prescription at a pharmacy. But aside from a small number of prescription-only products, medicinal cannabis products are not approved medicines in Australia, meaning they have not been assessed for safety, quality or effectiveness. A study in the Journal of Clinical Pharmacology found CBD products were commonly labelled with an inaccurate dose, and CBD concentration varied across batches of the same product purchased at different times. The study also found it was impossible to confirm if the level of THC stated on the label was correct and that the product was uncontaminated without independent expert testing. The TGA said evidence about the effectiveness of medicinal cannabis on different medical conditions was limited. Little is also known about the most suitable doses of individual cannabis products. Advertising medicinal cannabis products to consumers in Australia is also illegal and doing so can lead to heavy fines and/or jail. “Any advertising that claims a medicinal cannabis product can treat cancer, mental illness, epilepsy or any other serious condition is likely to be breaking the law, even if the advertiser believes there is evidence to support the claim. These rules protect vulnerable consumers,” the TGA said. In December, a man was given four fines totalling $10,656 for alleged unlawful advertising of cannabidiol (CBD).

The Courier-Mail can reveal patients have been quoted up to $USD 26,000 a year, or about $AUD 93 a day, from an approved importer – leaving them no choice but to continue sourcing medicinal cannabis through illegal channels.  And any hope of securing a subsidy from either the Palaszczuk or Turnbull Governments appears to be dashed, with both Queensland Health Minister Cameron Dick and Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt suggesting each other should fund it.  Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday that just four patients had to date been granted access to medicinal cannabis through the state’s single-prescriber pathway, with a further two patients enrolled in the Lady Cilento Children’s Hospital trial.  But she said it was hoped the new bulk importation rules introduced by the Turnbull Government would reduce waiting times, currently averaging four months, and bring down costs for patients.  Steve Peek, who fears his eight-year-old daughter Suli would die without access to the cannabis oil he usually gets for free from a supplier, said he’d been quoted $USD 26,000 a year for a legal alternative.  “It’s impossible,” he said. Chrissy Dunphy said it took eight months for her application for medicinal cannabis for her daughter Melissa, who has refractory epilepsy, to be approved.  But the biggest shock came when she received a quote of $17,325 for a three month supply. “It’s astronomical,” she said. “I am wondering how they can justify it.” Last month, Mr Dick wrote to Mr Hunt asking him to “accelerate steps” to subsidise the products through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.  Mr Hunt’s reply said only medicines approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration could be added to the PBS. “If the Queensland government wishes to consider subsidising medicinal cannabis products for its citizens, that is a matter for it to consider,” he wrote.  Yesterday, Mr Dick urged him to reconsider: “We want it to be as affordable as possible, but that ball is now in Mr Hunt’s court,” he said.

Its use will be heavily controlled, with a prescription needed and only pharmacists able to dispense it. But despite Health Minister John Day saying medicinal cannabis products could be available in early 2017, Epilepsy Association of WA chief executive Suresh Rajan believes a number of factors will push that back to 2018. MORE: Family’s joy at WA medicinal cannabis legalisation One of those is the fact any doctor wishing to prescribe medicinal cannabis would need approval from the Therapeutic Goods Administration and an expert advisory committee, which is yet to be established. He said it would also take time for local manufacturers to apply for a licensing permit, while months will be needed to produce and test a suitable product. He added Perth doctors would be hesitant to import it from overseas. “We’re happy but there is still work to be done,” he said, saying he was behind the drug’s use because it had been shown to reduce severity and frequency of seizures. “The process of growing, producing and making sure it’s a suitable product will mean it’s 2018 before it can be used by a patient. “We could import it but it is costly and doctors will be loath to prescribe an overseas product.” Australian Medical Association WA President Andrew Miller said preliminary findings showed medicinal cannabis could be quite effective in helping |patients suffering from spasms associated with multiple sclerosis but backed other drugs previously approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for treatment of other conditions. “It must be stressed that medicinal cannabis in the Australian context is not raw cannabis, rather it is one or two of the hundreds of chemicals that are found in the plant,” Dr Miller said. “These derivatives are not the all-curing wonder drug that some advocates claim and are only effective in a very limited scope of medicine. “There needs to be more robust studies on the safety and efficacy of medicinal cannabis before it is used in other areas where we already have medicines. “It is very unlikely it will have wide applications that will sustain a significant industry.” While acknowledging the drug might not be a super cure for all seizure types and there was still plenty of testing to do, Mr Rajan said Epilepsy WA was behind its use because it had shown to help in many cases. But he said parents desperate for their children to utilise it as part of their treatment may consider alternative methods of sourcing the drug rather than wait, if they were not already. “There are many parents doing that now,” he said. “There’s no doubt. “This isn’t about getting high. All parents are trying to do is help their child who may be having hundreds of seizures every day. “It’s one of the most confronting things you could see.” Mr Day said the State Government was doing everything it could to facilitate access to medicinal cannabis to approved patients. “It is important that people follow due process and any moves to circumvent this illegally will be dealt with by appropriate law enforcement,” he said.","Nov 7, 2016 ...

The 26-year-old from rural Curlwaa on the NSW-Victoria border wants to find work, but the medicinal cannabis she's used for years stops her from driving. ""I still have my driver's licence, however I have signed a waiver that I can't use my medication and drive,"" Ms Gentle told AAP. ""I'm disadvantaged because of a medication that I have been prescribed,"" she said. A NSW inquiry is on Thursday examining a bill that would let people like Ms Gentle get on with their lives while continuing to take their medicine. The bill, introduced by Greens MP Cate Faehrmann, would provide a defence against drug driving charges for medicinal cannabis users, similar to existing allowances for people prescribed valium or methadone. ""Medicinal cannabis is far safer than morphine and other opioids on and off the road, but it's only medicinal cannabis patients who test positive who face life-destroying drug driving charges,"" Ms Faehrmann says. Drug driving law reform advocate David Heilpern says legislation needs an update. ""When they brought these laws forward, there was no medicinal cannabis,"" he told AAP. Tests have also became more sensitive, adding to the unanticipated unfairness of the law, Mr Heilpern said. He left his 22-year career as a magistrate in 2020 after presiding over numerous cases where prescribed medicinal cannabis users faced losing their driver's licence, placing their careers and contact with family in jeopardy. ""It just seemed to me appallingly unfair,"" he said. Australians have increasingly been prescribed medicinal cannabis since it was legalised in 2016 - almost 123,000 last year according to the Therapeutic Goods Administration. That was more than double the prescriptions given in 2020. Ms Gentle was ahead of the trend, being prescribed cannabis in 2019 after suggestions from several specialist doctors. It came at the end of a long road beginning when she was diagnosed with Graves' disease. After having her thyroid removed, she spent weeks in hospital due to allergic reactions to the prescribed hormone replacements. She was eventually able to leave hospital, but the severe nausea caused by the allergy followed her home, and didn't subside until she found the right medication. ""The only thing that got me through, and has worked wonders for me, is cannabis,"" Ms Gentle told AAP. ""It was obvious in my hospital notes because I was going to hospital once every week for IV fluids and antibiotics and that stopped when I started cannabis."" But until laws change, Ms Gentle is being held back from pursuing the career in psychology she has been studying for, unable to drive to complete required placements. She's also forced to rely on family for travel due to a lack of public transport in her rural area. Ms Faehrmann says her bill is a chance to solve those problems for Ms Gentle and others in a similar situation. ""Medicinal cannabis patients shouldn't be forced to choose between driving and holding down a job and the only medicine that helps them,"" she said. The government will not be supporting the bill. ""Medicinal cannabis is not comparable to other drugs, in part due to its widespread use and availability for non-medicinal purposes,"" reads the government's submission - one of 105 to the inquiry. ""There is no reliable way to distinguish or prove whether the source of THC is illicit or prescribed,"" the government submitted. The bill - and its proposed changes to laws around crime and drugs - will likely depend on support from the opposition Labor party preparing to contest an election in March.","Jun 15, 2022 ...

PMH head of neurology Lakshmi Nagarajan, who is also the director of its epilepsy program, said there was evidence medicinal cannabis may be useful in treating children with Dravet syndrome, Lennon Gastaut syndrome and infantile spasms. Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic childhood illnesses but despite many advances in treatment options, including anti-epileptic drugs, vagal nerve stimulation, special diets and brain surgery for selected candidates, about 30 per cent of children with epilepsy continue to have seizures. Dr Nagarajan said children affected by Treatment Resistant Epilepsy in Childhood (TREC) could benefit from medicinal cannabis. She said cannabinoid, found in the cannabis plant or the enriched product, had been well-tolerated by patients in several reports, case studies and open label trials, even offering benefits such as improved sleep, alertness and mood. However, Dr Nagarajan noted that more than 10 per cent of participants were adversely-affected in a recent trial of patients aged between one and 30. The State Government enacted regulations to make medicinal cannabis a controlled prescription drug at the start of this month. Dr Nagarajan said it gave clinicians another treatment option. “Living with epilepsy in childhood has implications for the quality of life for the child and family, beyond the effects of seizures themselves,” she said. “Several reports as well as feedback from families of children with TREC on the efficacy of cannabinoid or CBD (cannabinoid) enriched extracts have suggested they may be useful in treating TREC.”","Nov 24, 2016 ...

Nationally recognised as one of the most controversial cases surrounding the use of the drug, young epileptic Cooper Wallace, with his family, stood tall in light of the announcement.  “It’s exciting. We just hope that the laws can change quick enough for children like Cooper, and we’re not left waiting,” his mother, Cassie Batten, said.  PARENTS PLEAD FOR LEGAL MEDICAL MARIJUANA TO HELP SICK SON  Cooper’s progress and having the chance to pave the way for other families suffering a similar fate was worth the battle they had faced, Ms Batten said.  “He couldn’t sit, he couldn’t crawl, he couldn’t eat or drink orally. He was in hospital for over 200 days one year, and the longest he was home was only 16 days,” she said.  “He had no quality of life at all. Now he is having, on average, 15-20 days a year in hospital, he is off a lot of pharmaceutical medication, he is crawling, sitting, beginning to stand, so he’s doing very well.”  The family is not certain if Cooper will participate in trial but said it was a great stepping stone for regulating the drug.  Premier Daniel Andrews said the Government would work toward legalising the use of medicinal cannabis for families like Cooper’s if the trial proved to make a significant difference.  “I was convinced by (Cooper’s) experience that medicinal cannabis works and that medicinal cannabis is really such an effective and lifesaving treatment therapy for so many families, particularly those who have infants who have really poor quality of life,” he said.  “That convinced us that no parent should ever have to choose between saving their child’s life and breaking the law, that’s not a choice we should make any parent make.”  In partnership with the NSW government the trial is expected to begin in mid-2016 and will first be tested on 60 to 200 children with severe, drug resistant epilepsy.

Ava Neville was diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis, a rare genetic disease that causes benign tumours to grow in the brain, and her condition was declared “inoperable” in 2013 after two failed brain surgeries.  “We were told she was no longer a surgical candidate, so we were left with nothing,” her mother said.  “We were so desperate this time last year that I would have gone down to the corner and bought pot. I would have tried anything.” Luckily, it didn’t come to that.  More than 20 anti-epileptic medications later, Ms Neville has finally found a lasting treatment for her daughter through “hemp oil”, a form of medicinal cannabis.  The only catch is the treatment has not been legalised in WA.  Ava’s progress prompted her mum to make a submission to the current federal inquiry into medicinal cannabis.  Unmedicated, Ava could experience up to 20 seizures a day. Today, thanks to hemp oil, that has been reduced to about two seizures a day.  The drug has been life-changing for the family, who previously had lived off five hours of broken sleep each night for the past five years due to Ava’s seizures.  Ms Neville said 10-year-old Ava’s cognitive abilities had doubled since last year and she now reads at a six-year-old level – an achievement that has left her teachers dumbfounded.  “It’s miraculous, really. She’s calm and attentive but she’s certainly not high,” Ms Neville said.  The Neville family import hemp oil manufactured by US company Elixinol, one of three firms supplying the NSW clinical studies on epilepsy.  Proponents say cannabidiol (CBD), found in Elixinol’s hemp oil, helps re-establish a connection between the brain and cells, improving cognitive function.  Ms Neville said she wants to increase Ava’s dosage to get the remaining seizures under control, but the single-income family can’t afford it. One treatment, which lasts three weeks, costs about $550.  Ms Neville said she understood the need for a regulation process, but said the legalisation of medicinal cannabis would save her a fortune and allow her doctor to prescribe it.  “We are saving the Government and taxpayer about $250,000 a year in prescription medication, respite and therapy, and yet we are having to pay,” she said.  Ava’s grandfather, former federal Nationals MP Paul Neville, said her “miraculous” progress had completely changed his attitude towards medicinal drugs.  Mr Neville said there should be a “therapeutic focus” for medicinal use.  “When you see people with particular medical needs that are not being fulfilled by conventional drugs, I don’t think you can approach it with a closed mind,” he said.  WA Labor Leader Mark McGowan said he supported cannabis being prescribed under strict medical supervision for patients suffering terminal or chronic pain.  Health Minister Kim Hames’s office said WA was waiting on the NSW trial. Patients in the trial will begin treatment early next year. ","Aug 8, 2015 ...

Daniel Eli Bain left the District Court today with a pair of convictions, but no further penalty, for the 76 cannabis plants he grew between January 2011 and June 2012. Judge Paul Slattery said the 15 months and 28 days Bain had spent in custody prior to his trial was sufficient penalty, but stressed cannabis was “a large problem in our society”. Outside court, Bain told The Advertiser he was grateful for Judge Slattery’s approach, but now faced an uncertain future dealing with his chronic pain. “Opiates are not something I’m about to do and, obviously, growing (cannabis) is out of the question — I’ve been arrested far too many times, it’s far too dangerous,” he said. “I’m just going to have to deal with the pain, which is increasing incrementally year after year. “Australia needs something similar to the laws in America, where you’re allowed to grow your own ... I hope that happens, but I don’t see our government doing the right thing.” Bain, 38, of Blakeview, had pleaded not guilty to two counts of cultivating a commercial quantity of a controlled plant. He instead pleaded guilty to the lesser offence of cultivating a controlled plant — a plea rejected by prosecutors. At his trial in July, prosecutors alleged at least some of the 43 plants Bain grew at Elizabeth Downs, and the 33 plants he grew at Elizabeth Park, were for commercial use. Bain denied this, saying every plant was to be used to ease the chronic pain he had suffered for 15 years — a malady that could not be aided by prescription medications. He said he smoked “more than an ounce a week, even up to two ounces a week” to keep the pain at bay. Jurors rejected his evidence in part, finding him guilty of growing the 33-plant crop for commercial use but finding he had no intention to profit from the 43-plant harvest. Today, Judge Slattery said that finding reactivated Bain’s plea to the lesser offence, meaning he was to be sentenced for two crimes. He noted doctors had diagnosed Bain with chronic arthritic pain in his legs, back and hands, and with Fibromyalgia, or widespread pain throughout the skin and muscles. “I acknowledge the evidence given ... in relation to the medicinal benefits of cannabis in relation to the treatment of chronic pain,” he said. “In your evidence, you said that you experienced the full effect of smoking cannabis (only) in order to obtain its medical benefit. “This has all the hallmarks of specious reasoning, but it’s not necessary for me to give further consideration to the matter.” Judge Slattery said Bain’s offences — the latest in a long history of cannabis-related charges — “were not trivial” and both he and the public should be discouraged from growing the drug. “Cultivating cannabis, for any reason, is still illegal in Australia and a large problem in our society,” he said.

It has been selected by the University of Notre Dame to be part of a study by its Institute for Health Research in partnership with Israel-based MGC Pharmaceuticals. The 14-month clinical trial will involve 50 people older than 65 with mild dementia and who live in an accredited residential aged care facility. The search for volunteers started this month. They will be given a medicinal cannabis oil called Cognicann as an oral spray. All participants will be randomly allocated into two treatment groups where they will be administered and alternated between the medical cannabis oil and a placebo trial. Safety monitors will be in place to monitor side effects, as well as withdrawal and exit strategies where needed. More than 400,000 Australians live with dementia and more than 1.5 million Australians are involved in their care. Catholic Homes has seven aged care residences, six of which are in the Perth metropolitan area. Residential care services executive manager Michelle Barrow said the trial’s treatment method was a much softer approach to traditional treatments. “Medicinal cannabis may also increase appetite in those who have experienced a loss of appetite as a symptom of dementia.” Institute for Health Research director Professor Jim Codde said the study hoped to improve the quality of life for dementia and Alzheimer’s sufferers by freeing them from agitation and psychotic symptoms that come with the disease and often affect their families and loved ones. “Planning for the study has been extremely extensive and involved other key stakeholders, including medical experts, aged care practitioners and our ethics committee to ensure the well-being of participants throughout the study,” he said. Notre Dame pro vice-chancellor Professor Greg Blatch said the study was part of the university’s focus on ground-breaking research that made a real difference. “Notre Dame’s health and medical research has been rated well above the world standard and is underpinned by strong partnerships with industry,” he said. Health Minister Roger Cook announced last week GPs would be able to prescribe medicinal cannabis without referring patients to a specialist. The change brings WA closer into line with other Australian jurisdictions including NSW, Queensland and Victoria. Doctors will still be required to seek specialist approval when prescribing for children under the age of 16 and for patients who are drug dependent or have a history of drug use. The change came after a three-year Department of Health review. There were 876 approvals to prescribe medicinal cannabis in WA from November 2016 to August 2019. “Medicinal cannabis is often prescribed as a drug of last resort for people who are suffering and in terrible pain,” Mr Cook said.

With just five days to go until federal laws makes medicinal cannabis a controlled prescription drug, Health Minister John Day said he “welcomed the changes”, which opened the door for medicinal cannabis to be used as a treatment in certain circumstances. It comes after years of the WA Liberals refusing to recognise the emerging treatment which was backed by numerous studies throughout the world. Mr Day said that while growers and manufacturers could apply for a licensing permit from November 1, medicinal cannabis products were not expected to be available for patients until early next year. “Like all controlled drugs, medicinal cannabis will be prescription only, with strict rules around prescribing,” Mr Day said. “Medical practitioners will be at the centre of all treatment decisions and patients will need to discuss their situation with their treating doctor. “Only a pharmacist will be able to dispense medicinal cannabis, with supply from any other means remaining illegal in Western Australia.” Mr Day said processes were in place to ensure the appropriate use of medicinal cannabis as a treatment option. “The focus for the WA Government will be on the safety, efficacy and quality,” he said. “It is important consumers remain protected from illegal, poorly made or harmful products. “Products that could potentially be approved will be those in safe and accepted pharmaceutical formulations. Raw cannabis and the smoking of cannabis will not qualify as medicinal cannabis.” Mr Day said any doctor wishing to prescribe medicinal cannabis would need approval from the Therapeutic Goods Administration and an expert advisory committee, to be established by the Department of Health.","Oct 27, 2016 ...

Children suffering severe epilepsy will be among the first to be treated using a range of non-smokable marijuana products including oils, sprays and vaporisers. Legislation will be introduced by the end of the year establishing the Office of Medicinal Cannabis which will oversee research, development and the dispensing of marijuana products. The move comes after the Victorian Law Reform handed down 42 recommendations on August 31, including how to dispense the drug through pharmacies to patients who have been prescribed treatment by a medical specialist. The report recommends strictly forbidding people to grow their own cannabis and instead calls for licensed manufacturers similar to the opium poppy industry. Premier Daniel Andrews said the “landmark reform means Victorian families will no longer have to decide between breaking the law and watching their child suffer”. Patients must suffer severe epileptic seizures, muscle spasms resulting from multiple sclerosis, severe pain and nausea arising from cancer or HIV/AIDS or chronic pain approved by two specialists. Patients with other medical conditions may be considered in exceptional circumstances but must be approved by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr Andrews said the medicinal marijuana legislation made this one of the best days in his political career. He said he wanted to provide the reform for children such as four-year-old severe epilepsy sufferer Cooper Wallace. “There are about 450 of those beautiful little people and they are going to get the medicine they need for the first time,” Mr Andrews said. “The time has come for us to stop finding reasons to do this. “There will be a cost involved, there is not doubt about that. It is not about dollars and cents, it is about saving lives.” The government supports 40 of the commission’s recommendations and will further investigate two recommendations relating to patient eligibility after receiving advice from medical specialists. VLRC chair Philip Cummins said the state played a key role in controlling the dispensing of cannabis products to “ensure accurate dosages and product purity”. “The Commission does not recommend a ‘do it yourself’ or ‘grow your own’ scheme,” he said. “The best way to treat the approved patients with medicinal marijuana is through the medicinal and pharmaceutical system. “This report is driven by compassion and medical responsibility.” The scheme will allow a number of products with differing levels of CBD and THC suitable for different patients. The report indicates the Government scheme will cost substantial amounts but did not investigate a figure. Specialist Commissioner Ian Freckleton said the new legislation was groundbreaking and would stop desperate patients and their families from being prosecuted by the law for using medical marijuana. A small scale cultivation trial will be established by the Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources to test plant varieties and cannabinoid levels of products. Mr Cummins said Victoria was choosing a more controlled system similar to the Netherlands. There is no need for federal legislation to cultivate the drug but the Commonwealth must give permission for the scheme to go ahead. Laws which need regulation change include: the Therapeutic Goods Act, the Narcotic Drugs Act and quarantine and customs laws. Health Minister Jill Hennessy said the move was an important medical step. “Victoria is leading the way on legalising medicinal cannabis because we know the difference it can make to a patient’s quality of life, and because we know the evidence is growing in support of it as a treatment.” The law reform commission said the cultivation licences will also be vetted carefully to ensure only fit and proper persons would be allowed a permit minimising the risk of organised crime networks from abusing the system. Opposition leader Matthew Guy said he supported medical trials and the use of medicinal marijuana in principle. Greens MP Colleen Hartland said it was imperative for treating children with epilepsy. “Totally support it. The logical thing is for us to be growing it here and distilling it here so we know the quality.” Sex Party MP Fiona Patten said she was concerned if the scheme was to specialised many patients could miss out on the benefits. “In principle I support any legislation that makes marijuana for medicinal purposes to the community but if you make it too restrictive you will see a grey market emerge so I am cautious.” How it will work: — Patients are prescribed by a medical specialist — Pharmacy will dispense — GP will oversee treatment plan Originally published as Children first to try medicinal cannabis","Oct 6, 2015 ...

Reymond Messer, who has had chronic pain since injuring his back in 2005, took part in a Zelira Therapeutics study with Emerald Clinics in Perth and Melbourne’s St Vincent’s Hospital. Mr Messer was part of a group of chronic non-cancer pain patients who were long-term, high-dose users of opioid-based medications. The trial participants took a daily dose of a cannabinoid medication in addition to their regular medication, and experienced reduced levels of pain, stress, depression and anxiety after two weeks with no serious adverse events. “This is one of the first clinical trials to assess the safety of medicinal cannabis on patients whose pain is so debilitating that they need to take large doses of opioid medications to get through the day,” Zelira’s managing director Richard Hopkins said. “Not only did we find that our cannabinoid formulation is safe for them to use and did not result in any serious side effects, but we have also seen promising positive effects on their physical and mental wellbeing.” Mr Messer said he had been involved in a previous medicinal cannabis trial but found the benefits did not outweigh the cost of that medication. He said while this year’s trial did not greatly affect his pain levels either, his doctor had since doubled the dosage. “It relaxed me a bit but I didn’t really benefit,” he said. “What I’m on now is helping me sleep a bit better.” The Two Rocks resident said he injured his back while working for the Australian Defence Force at Pearce in 2005. “I slipped and fell into a hole; it compacted my spine,” he said. “I’ve got scar tissue on my nerves – it caused degeneration of my spine. It’s not going to get any better.” Mr Messer said he had learnt to work his life around the pain, which was usually about 6 out of 10, but struggled to drive long distances. “If I drive to Busselton, it takes me a day to get over it,” he said. The trial involved blood tests and questionnaires to assess how the drug affected the patients’ pain levels as well as anxiety, stress and depression. Principal investigator and St Vincent’s addiction medicine department director Yvonne Bonomo said the trial showed the medication, ZTL-103 was “safe and well-tolerated in patients diagnosed with chronic pain who were also taking high oMEDD (oral morphine equivalent daily doses)”. Dr Hopkins said the results supported efforts to develop cannabis medicines to help people looking for alternative methods to manage their chronic pain. “Prescription opioids for treating chronic pain are linked to serious side effects including physical dependence, which is an acknowledged growing global crisis,” he said.","Aug 18, 2020 ...

The Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA) accepts applications to use cannabis for pain, provided it’s approved by a specialist. But many pain specialists are reluctant to tick off the treatment due to a lack of research in the space, instead prescribing opioids veterans don’t want to take. The DVA doesn’t approve cannabis for PTSD or any mental-health related issues, leaving antidepressants and sleeping pills as options. Without the DVA’s financial support, veterans are struggling to keep paying for medicinal cannabis. Vietnam veteran Michael, who asked for his full name not to be used, has struggled with PTSD since the war. He stopped taking antidepressants and painkillers after discovering cannabis. “A few years ago, a friend of mine said, ‘Man, you need to chill’. I was on antidepressants, anti-anxiety tablets and quite a few other ones,” he said. “I now don’t take any antidepressants, I don’t take any of the painkillers. I’d been self-medicating and staying away from those tablets for some time and now they’ve made (medicinal cannabis) legal, I’ve dropped off even more blood-pressure tablets. “I now just vaporise – you don’t have a puff, you vaporise – and I’m good. I laugh a lot more, I have joy in my life, my quality of life is superb.” But Michael said he was “screaming out” for financial support from the DVA, with six weeks’ worth of medicinal cannabis costing him around $450. “It’s crazy. Absolutely bloody crazy,” he said. Chris Goulding, who served for five years, dislocated his shoulder while serving and now has arthritis in his back. Mr Goulding was on tramadol for a decade, experiencing anxiety and depression as side effects before discovering cannabis prescriber Dr James Stewart through a friend. The 30-year-old swapped tramadol for medicinal cannabis and felt markedly “healthier”. But Mr Goulding is a father of three and can’t afford to persist if the DVA doesn’t amend its protocols. He estimated he’d spent around $10k on the treatment in only two years. “DVA have said they’re not approving medicinal cannabis for depression, anxiety or mental health because the side effects are too much of a risk. So they’ve cancelled that and said it’s only for pain,” Mr Goulding said. “I’m a family man, I’ve got three kids, I can’t afford to keep this up. “I’ve slowed down my intake of medicinal cannabis because of the cost. Sleep’s gotten worse, so I spoke to my pain specialist and he prescribed me tramadol again. “So after two years of finally kicking tramadol, I go back for an appointment and he gives me tramadol. “They can look at the side effects of different medications over the long term. Ten years on tramadol, I never had anxiety before, now I’ve got that diagnosed. “It’s little things like this. It plays with your depression and mental health in general.” In an email exchange between Dr Stewart, fellow prescriber Dr Jim Connell and the DVA, the veterans’ department said it would consider the doctors’ views when it reviewed its cannabis protocols. But it is unclear when – or if – a review is planned. Dr Stewart offered to rewrite DVA protocols for free, arguing current guidelines are outdated and unreasonable.

Ryan Paul Holbrook pleaded guilty to nine charges including cultivation, possession of cannabis with intent to sell or supply and firearms charges. The prosecutor said police executed a search warrant at a Parmelia address on October 19 last year. They said he co-operated with police, taking them to a shed with 13 plants and a hydroponic set-up, and various quantities of dried leaf and three compressed cannabis tablets around his home. There were also various items including zip-lock bags, scales, a grinder, 200 cannabis seeds, a list with a tally of how much sold and $1005 in cash. A .303 rifle was found under his bed and although it had no bolt it was in working order. Two extendable batons and a knife were also found. His lawyer said the facts were accepted and that the offences were the culmination of pain management attempts after he sustained a significant back injury in the early 2000’s. “He battled with significant pain and turned to cannabis as a way to manage that pain,” she said. “He became addicted when he needed large amounts. “Due to the cost he began supplying to another – his sole customer.” She said he bought the gun as an antique off Gumtree several years ago and had no idea it was capable of being fired. She said the search warrant had set about a positive catalyst for change for her 34-year-old client. Magistrate Vivien Edwards accepted his defence. “Dealing in drugs is a scourge in this community and I do accept there was only one person you dealt to,” she said. “Still dealing to one is still dealing – it was still a commercial operation. “The pre-sentence report indicates you do have treatment needs and I am satisfied it can be dealt with by an order.” He was placed on a 12-month community-based order with supervision, drugs counselling, programs and urinalysis. He was also fined $500.

Bibra Lake-based Source Certain will also attempt to stop illegally harvested cannabis entering the medical market. AusCann, which intends to grow cannabis for medicinal use in WA, is partnering with Source Certain to maintain supply chain integrity.  “(Source Certain) technology gives us full traceability of product,” Elaine Darby, founder and managing director of AusCann, told The Sunday Times. “With this particular industry, the regulators are very concerned about product getting into the illicit market or being diverted in any way. “The beauty of this technology is we can quickly say hand on heart that (the cannabis) did not come from our facility.  “Obviously we have a lot of procedures, checks and balances in place to ensure that does not happen, but it’s just an extra layer (of protection) where we can say definitively that it did not come from AusCann. “Also, if there was product that was out there and put in some of our packaging, we can know quite quickly and clearly if that is ours as well.” The forensic chemistry used by Source Certain and pioneered by the company’s John Watling, formerly Winthrop Professor of Forensic and Analytical Chemistry at the University of WA, has been successfully used to detect food fraud by tracing the origin of produce.  One of Dr Watling’s more startling finds was that prawns sold to consumers in Australia contained trace elements of cooling water from a nuclear power plant.  Forensic chemist and Source Certain chairman Cameron Scadding said: “The Source Certain team will be active in the whole supply chain making sure that genuine (AusCann) product reaches the end consumer, wherever this may be around the world ... it is critical that you can tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys.  “You can’t drag a legal supply chain above ground and not expect influences that are less than desirable.” Medicinal cannabis became a controlled prescription drug in Australia this week. AusCann is set to apply this month to the Commonwealth Office of Drug Control for relevant licences to cultivate and manufacture cannabis for medicinal use. The company, which has two former Liberal MPs on its board — former federal politician Mal Washer and former WA environment minister Cheryl Edwardes — said there was still more to do.  “Realistically we are not going to see Australian product available until closer to the end of next year,” said Ms Darby, who isn’t allowed to reveal where in WA it intends to grow its crops. In the meantime, doctors will have to use imported products. In WA, any doctor wanting to prescribe medicinal cannabis has to get approval from the Therapeutic Goods Administration and an expert advisory committee, to be established by the Department of Health. Health Minister John Day said the focus would be on “safety, efficacy and quality.” “It is important consumers remain protected from illegal, poorly made or harmful products,” Mr Day said. “Only a pharmacist will be able to dispense medical cannabis, with supply from any other means remaining illegal in WA.” AusCann has already entered a partnership with the world’s biggest legal cannabis producer, Canada’s Canopy Growth Corporation.  “This gives AusCann an enormous advantage, to be able to bring all of that expertise to the table to set up in Australia,” Ms Darby said.","Nov 5, 2016 ...

Six weeks after announcing a licensing scheme to manage the supply of locally grown medicinal cannabis, Health Minister Sussan Ley has returned to the drawing board. Instead of allowing the states to set up individual cultivation schemes, as she announced in October, the Minister now says she wants a single national cultivation scheme run by the Commonwealth Government. In October, the government promised it would bring legislation to set up a cultivation scheme “to parliament by the end of the year”. With just one parliamentary sitting day left, she is now promising “in consultation with state and territory Governments, to introduce legislation in the first sitting period of 2016”. “I am confident creating one single, nationally-consistent cultivation scheme, rather than eight individual arrangements, will not only help speed up the legislative process, but ultimately access to medicinal cannabis products as well,” Ms Ley said. Medicinal cannabis advocate Lucy Haslam has described the delay as “very disappointing”. “I’m fairly cynical, I don’t think the federal government has shown any leadership in this space,” she said. “To leave it until the last week of parliament is very disappointing, now they are talking a year and a half away,” she said. Lucy Haslam’s 25 year-old-son Dan was using cannabis to relieve nausea, vomiting and poor appetite caused by chemotherapy until he lost his battle with bowel cancer earlier this year. When the minister’s office contacted her yesterday they told her it would be 2017 before locally grown cannabis would be in the hands of patients, she said. “To me that is abject failure,” she said. Victorian mum Cheri O’Connell whose daughter Tara uses medicinal cannabis to control up to 500 epileptic seizures a day says “it’s upsetting that nothing is moving fast enough”. “Every delay is another child’s death,” she said. “A child in Bendigo died the other day and there are over 1000 kids using it illegally now,” she said. The Victorian Government will next week press ahead and introduce into State Parliament its own legislation to allow the cultivation and trial of medicinal cannabis. A spokeswoman for the state’s Health Minister Jill Hennessy said she was hoping the Federal Government would fast-track the Victorian cultivation licenses ahead of the introduction of the national scheme. “The Andrews Labor Government welcomes any move by the Commonwealth to establish a single nationally consistent scheme as this will create greater certainty and more access to medicinal cannabis for the families and children that need it the most,” Ms Hennessy said.  “However given the Commonwealth’s timelines on this continue to change, we are not prepared to delay the introduction of our legislation at the expense of the Victorian families and children that are desperately awaiting this much need reform,’ the minister said.  “I’ve seen first-hand the difference medicinal cannabis has made to the lives of children suffering from severe epilepsy and my priority is to ensure we can deliver on our promise so we can help these families as soon as possible, that why we’ll be pressing ahead with our own legislation this year.”  A spokesman for Federal Health Minister Ley said the new draft law would not restrict the type of cannabis that could be grown but suppliers would have to prove they had a market for their product — such as a clinical trial or a Therapeutic Goods Administration-approved manufacturer — before they could get a licence. Shadow Assistant Minister for Health Stephen Jones said he “welcomes the government’s decision to adopt Labor’s policy to have a single national scheme to regulate the cultivation of medicinal cannabis”. However he urged the Government to go further and create a truly national scheme for medicinal cannabis that doesn’t leave people in some states and territories unable to legally and safely access the product. “Under the Minister for Health’s plan, a person’s postcode will still determine whether or not they will be at risk of prosecution for possession and use of medicinal cannabis,” Mr Jones said. “As things stand, it is still up to the states and territories to decriminalise the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes and there is no guarantee they will adopt uniform national laws.” Originally published as ’Every delay is another child’s death’","Dec 2, 2015 ...

Joshua James Waldron’s sentencing took a turn on Thursday after the Caboolture man said he didn’t agree with the prosecution’s claim he grew the drug for commercial purposes. The medicinal marijuana advocate insisted he made no money from his endeavour and instead kept it for “research” and gave it to people who were sick or needed it. “(I) hope one day I’m actually going to be professional and valued in this country for what I do behind cannabis,” he said. Waldron pleaded guilty to one count each of producing and possessing dangerous drugs. Brisbane District Court was told police discovered more than 18kg of marijuana in his house when they searched his property in September last year, most of it packaged in boxes. Waldron told police he grew it for medicinal purposes. Crown prosecutor Siobhan Harrison said a calendar detailing watering schedules was located and Waldron used “sophisticated” property to grow the drugs. Waldron disputed Ms Harrison’s assertion that he received money from people for the drugs. “There was no reason for me to take money from people,” he said. “I received a form of payment in the form of thanks … I never sold (weed), I was too afraid to.” Representing himself, Waldron said he received nothing in exchange for the drug when supplying medicinal marijuana to “hundreds” of people. He said some of the marijuana, including small frozen quantities, was kept for research. “I was doing a phenotype-selection process which gets to the end of good genetics, stable plants,” Waldron said. “It was all different weights and strains, everything was labelled, nothing was intentionally packaged for sale. “Nothing was the same … everything had a particular use or need.” He said he knew his actions were illegal. The court was told some of the packaged drugs weighed differently as they were wet or frozen. In sentencing Waldron – who was supported by his partner and mother – Judge Jennifer Rosengren blasted him for seemingly thumbing his nose at the law due to prior convictions for similar offences. Health Minister Greg Hunt has announced a new medicinal cannabis oil will be made available from May 1 on the PBS for Dravet syndrome – a severe form of epilepsy which mainly impacts children. “What’s changed this time? You know it’s a crime, you know you’re doing the wrong thing, and yet here you find yourself back before a court and you want to beg leniency again?” she said. “You can’t keep doing this and expect courts to say ‘don’t worry about it’ when you’re producing cannabis in quantities such as this.” Waldron said it became harder for him to say no to sick people and he had an “idea of grandeur” for the law. The court was told he worked for an alcohol delivery service but would soon start work for a company trying to establish medicinal marijuana centres across Queensland. Judge Rosengren imposed a fine of $5000, ordering him to pay it within nine months or face jail. Convictions were recorded. She took into account his family circumstances, including a baby due in Christmas and a custody battle over his previous relationship, and his mental health challenges.

The nine-year-old was at school, engrossed in a test, when the slightest wrong movement caused the serious pain.  It wasn’t the first time it happened without warning and it will not be the last.  With her gap-toothed smile it would be easy to mistake Lily for a normal girl who adores learning and painting.  Yet she relies on opiate based medications every day to stay on top of her chronic pain caused by Ehlers-Danos Syndrome- a disorder which causes her points to regularly pop out of place.  She also suffers from Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, which overstimulates the nerves, making even the slightest touch painful.  “The lowest pain I have is about a five and the highest is about a nine,” Lily said.  “Every day I haven’t had a break from the pain, it really sucks.” Lily’s parents, Nicole and Lyndon, are one of thousands of families across Australia who are fighting for the legalisation of medicinal cannabis.  Mrs Poulter said she believed the natural form of pain relief would be a better substitute to the addictive and strong medications, including Tramadol and Oxynorm, Lily takes up to four times a day.  “They are opiate based and we all know opiates are highly addictive so I’m dreading the day she actually has to come off it,” she said. “It’s going to a 19-year-old going through the withdrawals of what a normal junkie would.” “It just kills me on a daily basis, just knowing the pain she goes through.”  “Knowing fair well that there is a substance out there which can help her which is natural and won’t give her side effects.” “The worst part of it is that the WA government are doing nothing to help us.”  WA Labor leader Mark McGowan has thrown his support behind the family’s plight to urge the state government to join medicinal cannabis trials taking place across Australia.  “Last year I announced I supported the prescription of medicinal cannabis for people who are terminally ill or in chronic pain in Western Australia,” he said.  “Lily is representative of thousands of West Australians who suffer from chronic pain or who might very unfortunately be terminally ill.” “I think people in that position deserve and need all of the treatments for pain which are out there.”  “The medications Lily is on are related to methadone or heroin or those sorts of drugs, admittedly it’s weaker but it’s related to that,” “We want our State to be a leader in medical research and part of a solution that would help people suffering in pain.”  New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria are scheduled to take part in the trials.  WA Health Minister Kim Hames said there was no point in all states doing the same sorts of trials at the same time. “WA is waiting on the results of the NSW trials as agreed last year,” he said. “If other states want to do their own trials, that’s fine.” “WA has offered out support to other states and we are keen to see the outcomes of the research being undertaken.”  Whatever the outcome Lily said she would continue to work hard in the classroom so she could become a doctor.  “So I can help people like me,” she said.

The cannabis would be legal for use in ­patients with a number of conditions such as terminal illnesses and for children who have chronic epilepsy. Mrs Haslam said yesterday she intended to apply for a licence from the federal government to cultivate and manufacture medicinal cannabis, and her goal is to be able to provide the drug on a subsidy for people who cannot afford it. “For me, that will be the high point, when I know people who need it are getting it,” Mrs Haslam said. Mr Grant said the farm was a testament to the Haslam family’s “tenacity and their vision to help others”.  “This milestone in Dan Haslam’s legacy is a testament that politics can work, when the local member Kevin Anderson can convince his party room and the Premier of the importance of accepting a concept that is outside of our traditional thinking,” Mr Grant said. “Lucy and Lou Haslam’s advocacy has achieved so much in a short time regarding trialling medicinal cannabis and the development of regulations across state and federal jurisdictions.” Mr Joyce said he supported the use of any plant that could help sick people. “When you can find … a plant that can assist people when they are ill, when they are in pain, then you should do it,” he said.  “And with this issue with cannabis there are constituent parts that can actually assist people.”  Originally published as Mum to grow medicinal cannabis as son’s legacy","Apr 16, 2016 ... ...

Victorian mum Cheri O'Connell spoke out about the benefits of liquid marijuana, which she says saved her epileptic daughter who was only given months to live. ""These issues in terms of approving medications are issues for the Therapeutic Goods Administration under the Federal Government,"" Dr Napthine said. ""They base their decisions on the best medical advice and science. That's the way these decisions ought to be based and I support that process."" Eight-year-old Tara was having up to 60 seizures a day but has made a miraculous recovery since her mother , Cheri started giving her liquid cannabis made in Nimbin. Doctors at one of Victoria's leading hospitals have acknowledged the ""remarkable improvements"" in the girl's condition one year after she started taking the drug. But Health Minister David Davis has warned families not to use medicinal marijuana, saying it remains illegal in Victoria and that the Government ""does not intend to change this legislation"". A Sunday Herald Sun investigation has found that up to 10 Victorian children, some as young as three, are taking daily doses of medicinal marijuana - in some cases administered by teachers - as desperate parents turn their back on pharmaceutical drugs. Cheri O'Connell gives her daughter Tara a liquid form of medicinal marijuana known as THC-A - which is posted to her in the mail - to treat her severe epilepsy. Ms O'Connell's claims of her daughter's miracle recovery - backed by Victoria's peak medical body - have fuelled calls for local clinical trials to test the effectiveness of medicinal marijuana. ""She was dying, she could barely walk or talk, was unable to toilet herself and slept a similar cycle to a newborn,"" Ms O'Connell said. ""We had basically been told that there was not too much more we could do, just to take her home and to love her and maybe if you are lucky she'll get to nine. ""We didn't see her having a future at all,"" Ms O'Connell said. ""Now, well she is never going to be the kid that holds a job and goes off and does everything because it's too late, the damage has been done."" Tara required a wheelchair, struggled to walk and had limited speech. But in January last year, her desperate parents started her on a cannabis mix known as a tincture, after a cocktail of prescribed medications left her heavily sedated and failed to stop the seizures. In developments that have surprised doctors, one year on, Tara is a bubbly eight-year-old and her wheelchair is collecting dust in the corner of the family's home in central Victoria. A recent neuropsychological assessment report by a leading doctor at Austin Health said Tara's overall cognitive performances were ""significantly improved on those documented 12 months ago."" ""Since commencing medical cannabis (together with the cessation of her seizures), there is a convincing clinical history of improvements in all facets of her presentation as reported by her mother,"" senior clinical neuropsychologist Dr Silvana Micallef wrote. An increased appetite and fatigue were the only recorded side-effects. The medical-grade marijuana, is administered orally through drops under the tongue and manufactured to be low in THC, the compound that produces a ""high."" The O'Connells have also started son Sean, 11 - who has a less severe form of epilepsy - on liquid cannabis. Ms O'Connell said her son could barely write before the drug, now he is seizure free and is a budding artist. She is calling on the state government to fund research into the drug which she claims has saved her daughter's life and is being used by at least 70 children across Australia. The Sunday Herald Sun understands the liquid cannabis is administered to a number of Victorian students by school staff. A spokesman from the Department of Education, Stuart Teather, refused to comment on any specific case citing student privacy. Victoria's peak medical body has backed the call for further research into medicinal cannabis. AMA Victoria vice-president Dr Tony Bartone said cannabis was being used legally for medical purposes in places such as Canada, the USA, the UK and Germany. ""There is a growing body of evidence on cannabis as an effective treatment for some types of chronic pain, the control of muscle spasticity, some forms of nausea and as an appetite-stimulant in patients with weight loss due to cancer or HIV,"" Dr Bartone said. He said the AMA supported more research, particularly into the administration of medicinal cannabis, ""as smoking or ingesting a crude plant product is harmful."" Epilepsy Australia general manager of Client Services, Wayne Pfeiffer also backed a call for ""an effective and controlled trial"". ""Some families have asked about it, but as it is illegal we can't really recommend it but there is a growing interest,"" Mr Pfeiffer said. ""About 70 per cent of people get control of seizures through medications, so for these remaining 30 per cent of people they are really hopeful of any new drugs."" Kay McNeice, spokeswoman for the federal Health Department, said: ""T he manufacture, possession, sale or use of any form of cannabis is prohibited under state and territory drugs and poisons legislation. ""These controls are in place for public health and safety to ensure, that all care is taken to prevent misuse of substances which are deemed harmful and for which there is no approved medicinal use."" ---------- We had to break the law or see her die ANY parent will do whatever it takes to make a sick child better. For the O'Connell family, that meant breaking the law - or losing their daughter. And after years of visiting doctors, using conventional medication and suffering heartbreak, the O'Connells say one of the last options left was the controversial use of medicinal cannabis to try to give Tara any future. The eight-year-old suffers from a severe form of epilepsy known as Dravet syndrome, and had been seriously ill all her life. Paramedics had even warned her parents they might not be able to resuscitate Tara next time, after four close calls. Tara could barely walk or talk and she slept as much as a newborn. She endured more than 20,000 seizures every year, and it was taking its toll on her tiny body. Her condition left Cheri and partner David, and Tara's siblings Sean and Jasmine, exhausted and fearing for the future. Running out of options, by chance, another family who had lost a similar battle told the O'Connells about medicinal cannabis. ""They didn't get to try the drug,"" Cheri said. ""She knew we didn't have long to go with Tara, we had nothing to lose. The side-­effect of not giving it to her was death. We have now passed the 12-month mark and she's healthier than ever."" Cheri said they knew the legal risks around the drug. ''We just thought, 'What else do they want us to do?' It's that or our kid dies,'' she said. One year on, Tara is now seizure-free, walking, running and even dancing. ""We didn't see her having a future at all,"" Cheri said. ""Now, well she is never going to be the kid that holds a job and goes off and does everything because it's too late, the damage has been done. ""But I can now see us being able to put a unit here and being able to live semi-independently. Before, that was never going to happen."" Across Australia a secret network of parents is using social media to share their experiences of medicinal cannabis for their sick kids. One mum, from Mernda in Melbourne's outer north, said her three-year-old son had shown dramatic improvements since taking it. Her son had meningitis as a baby and is intellectually and physically disabled. ""We were told he'd be lucky to make it to two years old,"" she said. ""We hesitated for 18 months. But after his first dose, within 15 minutes he was tracking things with his eyes for the first time."" She said the law needed to be changed so parents could legally access the drug. ""We are anti-drugs,"" she said. ""We feel like we are breaking the law, but if we didn't do it when we did, we wouldn't have him now."" In South Australia, a mother-of-two said her eight-year-old daughter was taking eight pharmaceutical medications before the family sourced the medicinal marijuana from interstate. ""I got to the point where we had nothing to lose. She was seizure-free within a day, where she would previously have two to three a day,"" the woman said.

This week, Victoria became the first state to permit the product after the Federal Government legalised its cultivation for medical purposes earlier this year. In New South Wales today , acting Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce was at the launch of Australia’s first farm earmarked for medical cannabis production. In Perth, Banksia Grove parents Lyndon and Nicole Poulter take hope from such announcements that their daughter Lily is closer to receiving the medication they believe will better ease her pain. Lily lives with a disorder known as Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which causes her joints to dislocate easily. The 10-year-old also experiences Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, a condition that can cause sudden intense pain in her limbs. The Poulters came to public awareness late in 2014 advocating through the media for access to medicinal cannabis. More than 18 months later, Lily’s most effective pain relief option remains opiates, which the Poulters are loathe to have her using. The parents had the distressing experience of watching their primary-school aged daughter go through withdrawals after she became addicted to the medication. They now try to limit its use, but when Lily is struck by extreme pain, Mr Poulter explained they have no other choice. “We’re worried about what it’s done to her body so we’re trying to avoid it,” he said. “But she still has her bad days… there’s only so much we can do as parents, you can’t let your child be in excruciating pain without doing something so we are still on (opioids) because we have to. “We’re law-abiding citizens and we don’t want to go down that line (of seeking out cannabis illegally). “We know there’s a few families that have, but we’re trying to avoid going down that line.” At hearing Victoria had moved to legalise medicinal cannabis, Lily’s mother Nicole said “it was about time someone did”. The drug is expected to be available in the state from next year, although initially restricted to epilepsy patients. Mrs Poulter said she would not consider moving to Victoria to have access to it given Lily’s treatment with specialists was too well established here. WA Labor leader Mark McGowan, who backed the Poulters cause in 2014, predicted medicinal cannabis would be available for use in WA by 2018 should he win office next year. Mr McGowan first raised his support for its legalisation in July 2014. “It’s heartbreaking to see young children, like Lily, suffering when help could be available,” he said. “It would be a high priority of a McGowan Labor Government and I can’t see why it couldn’t be available for medicinal purposes, under strict supervision, in 2018, but I would want to see it available as quickly as possible.” Asked about the potential economic benefits of the product, Mr McGowan said there was “real potential for medicinal cannabis to diversify WA’s economy and create new jobs”. He labelled the news from Victoria as “really positive”, saying WA was lagging behind. WA Health Minister John Day told the Times he was “open-minded to the potential benefits of medicinal cannabis”, but was strongly opposed to it in  recreational form. The Government has seemingly been in two minds about the product in recent years, with former Health Minister Kim Hames implying he was against medicinal cannabis in 2014, before changing his mind later that year and saying the government would support a trial of it through the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Mr Day said if “appropriately prescribed medicinal cannabis can relieve suffering” he wanted to “ensure West Australians have access to its benefits through safe and effective treatment regimes”. “State law already permits research into cannabis preparations in WA,” he said. “The State Government has offered to participate in the New South Wales (Government) study, and discussions are continuing about the feasibility of conducting a clinical trial with young epilepsy patients at Princess Margaret Hospital for Children.” The Times asked Mr Day via email how long he thought it would be before WA patients had access to medicinal cannabis, but he did not answer the question. He was also asked if the Government had looked at the potential tax revenue the product could return, but that also went unanswered. He did not comment on this week’s move from Victoria.","Apr 14, 2016 ...

Ross Smith, who founded Phytotech, was previously managing director at Pilbara Mines. “Because of the mining downturn, there’s opportunity now arising in the world market that wasn’t there previously,” Phytotech chairman Peter Wall said.  “There’s a much broader and bigger market for it — it’s an industry that will get bigger in time.”  Perth-based Erin Resources was previously intent on discovering multi-million dollar gold deposits in Senegal. Now it’s struck a reverse takeover deal with Israel-based medical and cosmetic cannabis start-up MGC Global.  MGC Global managing director Nativ Segev said the goal was to start growing and building crops in Slovenia by the end of this year.  Other Perth-based miners, International Goldfields and Capital Mining, are also jumping on pot stocks.  Help End Marijuana Prohibition (HEMP) party president Michael Balderstone said a century ago doctors would recommend cannabis as a pain reliever.  “I have no doubt it’s going to be legalised, but it’s a slow train coming,” he said. “Pain relief is probably the most profitable business on Earth — all the best pain relievers are illegal: opium poppy, cannabis and coca plants.”  Medicinal marijuana is also used to treat children with epilepsy, just a small amount can stop an epileptic seizure.  Mr Balderstone said former mining companies were identifying the medicinal cannabis market as a commodity.  WA Health Minister Kim Hames said there was evidence supporting the benefits of cannabis extracts. “But the evidence still needs to be of sufficient scientific quality to definitively answer questions about safety and efficacy,” Dr Hames added.  “There’s no point all states doing the same sorts of trials at the same time, so WA is waiting on the results of the NSW trials.”","Jun 1, 2015 ...

Clarkson, Australian basketball legend Lauren Jackson and top jockey Damien Oliver have been announced on an advisory board for Melbourne company Levin Health. The connections are obvious, with former AFL coaches association boss Mark Brayshaw the company’s managing director. Brayshaw’s brother and high-profile sports commentator James is the company sports and media advisor. Clarkson, who coached Hawthorn to four premierships, is taking a year off and went to the United States last month for study and business. “Regardless of whether it’s amateur or professional, AFL can be a brutal contact sport,” Clarkson said in a company statement. “Chronic pain and challenges associated with concussion are ongoing side-effects for many ex-AFL players and often for their friends in the wider community. “I know the doctors Levin Health are working with at La Trobe University really well and I trust them. Their involvement underpins the work Levin Health is doing so I’m happy to help where I can.” Clarkson has gone ahead with his sabbatical after knocking back feelers to coach Collingwood and Carlton. He ended his 17-year association with the Hawks in August when it became clear a proposed succession plan with new coach Sam Mitchell was unworkable. Last month, Clarkson also became an advisor to Tasmania’s bid for an AFL licence, giving that campaign a significant boost. He has said he would be open to coaching a Tasmanian AFL team. The sports science company is developing medicinal cannabis products, as well as “objective diagnostic and treatment devices for concussion”. The advisory board will look at areas such as chronic pain, concussion and mental health.","Nov 10, 2021 ...

Melbourne-based Althea says 1,925 patients have been prescribed with its cannabis products in Australia, and it is adding about 18 new patients per day. Chief executive Josh Fagan expects the company to have between 4,000 to 5,000 patients by year end. “The patient numbers are starting to get serious,” he said. “We think Australia has the potential to have 250,000 eligible patients in three to four years, even with the difficult regulatory framework we work in.” Getting doctors on board is the biggest hurdle, Mr Fagan said, as they need to either be approved as an authorised prescriber or must submit each prescription to the government for approval under a legal framework for medical cannabis created in October 2016. The Department of Health’s Therapeutic Goods Administration says that as of August 31 it had approved over 14,000 applications for medical cannabis, including 2,893 in August – up from 670 in January. Mr Fagan said those figures didn’t show whether those prescriptions were actually filled, however, and he believes Althea has about 30 to 40 per cent of the Australian medical cannabis market. There are 296 Australian healthcare professionals who have prescribed Althea’s products, the company said. Seventy per cent the prescriptions are to treat chronic pain, including from cancer, Mr Fagan said. Other patients use it to treat anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as sleep disorders. Althea has five products, four of which are oils that are taken through liquid dropped on the patient’s tongue using an oral syringe. Some of the oils contain THC, the ingredient from marijuana that gets patients high, while others aren’t psychoactive and just contain CBD, Mr Fagan said. Althea’s fifth product is dry flower cannabis, although that only consists of about five per cent of prescriptions, Mr Fagan said. Still it’s important, as some palliative care patients have lost the ability to swallow, he said. Althea’s products cost patients about $300, with most patients finding that’s enough to last them for a month, Mr Fagan said. Once patients have a prescription they simply bring it to a pharmacy which orders it from Althea. Althea also entered the UK market in June.","Sep 8, 2019 ...

And as the state government prepares to launch its world-first drug trials, hospital ethics committees have given the green light for children with drug-resistant epilepsy to receive a ­cannabis-based medication. At the same time, about 30 terminally ill adults at the Calvary Mater Hospital in Newcastle will be allowed to inhale vaporised leaf cannabis to alleviate their pain and increase their appetite. Children taking part in the compassionate access scheme will be given the drug Epidiolex and monitored by the Sydney Children’s Hospital network at Randwick and Westmead. The move comes less than a year after Medical Research Minister Pru Goward flew to the UK to convince the world’s top cannabis researcher to agree to test cannabinoid medicines in NSW. In his only Australian ­interview last week, Epidio-lex founder Dr Geoffrey Guy said he was excited at the progress after an attempt to have cannabis-based drugs tested here failed more than a decade ago. “We always look for ­research where we can see a channel all the way to the end product,” he said.  Developed by GW Pharmaceuticals, Epidiolex contains a non-psychoactive cannabinoid called CBD shown to alleviate the symptoms of epilepsy. The drug is in its phase three trial stage, with NSW to jump in to undertake the final phase four trial which is ­required before it can be approved for the public. Pending approval from the relevant regulatory bodies, health officials believe Epidiolex could be available as a prescription drug in local pharmacies in three years. A world-first trial of ­another anticonvulsant, the cannabis-based drug CBDV, is also set to begin, with NSW to start at the phase two stage. A third trial involving a cannabis-based drug to treat the side-effects of chemotherapy is also nearing the start stage, with details to be announced later this year. Ms Goward said a rollout of the compassionate access scheme, together with the imminent start of the trials, would come as a relief to families, many of whom were sourcing their own cannabis-based drugs illegally.  “There are plenty of countries where you can buy capsules or cookies, but NSW will be the first country to have pharmaceutical-grade products,” Ms Goward said. Epilepsy Action Australia CEO Carol Ireland said thousands of families were illegally accessing cannabis. Sonya and Tim Reynolds, from Dulwich Hill, in Sydney’s inner west, are anxiously awaiting ­access to cannabis-based drugs for their seven-year-old daughter Imogen, whose seizures are so frequent and severe it has interfered with her ability to learn how to read and write. Ms Reynolds has spent the past four years seeking and researching treatment for her daughter. “We want access to Epidiolex, but also other parts of the plant known to address other symptoms of epilepsy,” she said.

In a world-first, University of Western Australia researchers will test if the sedating effect of medicinal cannabis works on the one-in-three Australians who regularly have difficulty falling or staying asleep.  Lead researcher Peter Eastwood said insomnia cost the nation more than $66 billion a year, including lost productivity and health problems.  Current treatments for insomnia include cognitive behavioural therapy, which is “very effective” but time consuming and expensive, and the psychiatric drugs benzodiazepine, which are addictive and come with numerous side effects, Professor Eastwood told AAP on Monday.  “It’s a huge market,” he said.  Medicinal cannabis has previously been tested for its effectiveness in controlling epilepsy and chronic pain.  Test subjects reported side-effects including feelings of sleepiness, which led Perth-based pharmaceutical company Zelda Therapeutics to develop a cannabinoid formula to investigate its use in insomnia.  The double blind, randomised trial involves 24 volunteers who will place either a single drop of cannabis oil or a placebo under their tongue an hour before bed for two weeks.  They will then cross-over and test either the oil or the placebo for another two weeks.

Health Minister Greg Hunt says allowing medicinal cannabis product exports will help the developing domestic market blaze a new trail internationally.  “Our goal is very clear - to give Australian farmers and manufacturers the best shot at being the world’s number one exporter of medicinal cannabis,” Mr Hunt told reporters in Melbourne on Thursday.  He said Australia’s reputation for “clean and green” farm products meant it is well placed to be a leader in medical cannabis.  The export permit will be done by regulation.  The federal government in 2016 legalised patient access to Australian-grown and manufactured medicinal cannabis, subject to state and territory regulations.  Victoria became Australia’s first state to legalise cannabis for medical use and was quickly followed by NSW.  The federal health department says 350 patients have accessed Australian-grown medicinal cannabis products.  However, there are some concerns doctors are reluctant to prescribe the products.  “There is a small-to-medium quality body of evidence in so many of the areas where people are promoting the use of medicinal cannabis,” Australian Medical Association president Michael Gannon told reporters in Perth.  “But there is no question that where a doctor has made a decision and the patient wants to use the medication there should be fewer barriers to obtaining a safer legal supply.”  Mr Hunt says the government has been working with GPs and the AMA to help doctors feel more comfortable about prescribing marijuana.  “It’s a question for individual doctors about what they see best,” he said.  “We won’t be dictating to doctors what they should prescribe.”  Opposition frontbencher Anthony Albanese said it was a “sensible move forward“ for Australia to export medicinal cannabis products.  “We know that medicinal use of cannabis can alleviate people’s health issues and, therefore, if Australia’s in a position to provide support, it should do so,” he told reporters in Melbourne.  Mr Hunt’s announcement sent medical cannabis producers’ stocks to new highs on the ASX on Thursday.  The chief executive of Cann Group, whose shares were up about 28 per cent by early afternoon, said the export approval would allow the company to set up on a global scale.  “I think we are seeing there is a global shortage so there is going to be room for multiple players,” Peter Crock said.

It’s not what you expect to hear a protective mum say about her responsible young son.  But I was. So was his dad, who has served in the NSW police for 35 years.  Those suffering from chronic or terminal illnesses who use cannabis aren’t your usual criminals. They’re desperate. Other treatments have failed in easing their agonising pain like medicinal marijuana does. But the law sees them as no better than a dealer or thief.  In February, I lost my son Dan, 25, to bowel cancer. In the year leading up to his death, he asked me to help him show Australia the truth about medicinal cannabis. I agreed of course. On reflection I had no idea of where that promise would take me. Today is the biggest step forward so far in keeping this final, poignant promise to my beautiful son Dan. A parliamentary briefing in support of legalising it is happening, led by cross-party MPs and Professor David Penington AC. This mounts pressure on Tony Abbott to act on a Bill due to be introduced in the Senate this month on finally decriminalising cannabis for medicinal use. It’d bring Australia in line with other countries who’ve approved cannabis for medical use, including Spain, Italy, Germany, Canada, Austria, Argentina, Israel and 20 American states.  This follows a petition I set up using the platform Change.org. I’ve been overwhelmed by the support: 239,000 signatures and growing. Dan would be grinning from ear to ear. It shows that the government urgently needs to listen to the medical professionals, desperate parents and chronic illness sufferers who expect to be treated with empathy, not a possible jail sentence.  When Dan was first offered cannabis by a trusted friend and cancer survivor, he quickly rejected it — a testimony to the law-abiding way we’d brought him up.  Yet as a nurse, I watched cannabis make the last few months of my dear son’s life infinitely more comfortable. I saw him suffer terribly for three years of chemotherapy. Its associated nausea was so severe, it’d put him in hospital for days every fortnight.  The first day his dad rolled him a joint after chemo, Dan had to be instructed how to inhale.  Miraculously, Dan smiled broadly with relief and asked for food. His appetite had been killed by chemo, which had zapped his energy.  We cried with joy. Our son had just used cannabis for the first time and we were happy about it. I went on to be a cannabis supplier for him, an advocate to change a system which sees sick people and their carers criminalised for getting relief for serious medical conditions. Medicinal cannabis should be treated like any other medicine.  It will only be when Australia has a legitimate Medicinal Cannabis Regulatory body that research and expertise can be shared between patients and doctors in a safe environment. It’s not just people like Dan who’ll benefit. Since asking me to promise to decriminalise this, I’ve spoken to countless families who fear the repercussions of admitting to cannabis use. Parents watching their kids suffer will do anything to ease their pain. One mum I spoke to was Lanai Carter, whose son, Lindsay, 16, has a brain tumour. Cannabis controls his seizures. Lanai has spent $120,000 on four trips to US states where cannabis is legal. It has wiped out their family’s super. If it isn’t decriminalised here, they face uprooting and moving to the US. It isn’t just cancer sufferers who’ll benefit. Families of those living with epilepsy, HIV, chronic pain and muscle spasms have all reported how cannabis reduces nausea, restores appetites and prevents or eases seizures. NSW Premier Mike Baird said my son’s case made him “change his mind” about medicinal cannabis — now he’s in favour of decriminalisation. The Prime Minister emailed broadcaster and supporter Alan Jones last year to say: “I have no problem with the use of medicinal cannabis” and “If a drug is needed for a valid medicinal purpose, and is being administered safely, there should be no question of its legality.” Mr Abbott, please show Australia you mean what you say. Give the Regulator of Medicinal Cannabis Bill a chance by allocating urgent and adequate time for it to be debated. Help me fulfil my promise to my beautiful Dan.

Health experts say there is enough scientifically proven benefit to warrant the drug’s legalisation in Australia. But state governments have ordered trials despite more than 1600 research papers already completed around the world. Scientists say medicinal cannabis eases nausea in chemotherapy patients, assists with pain and muscle spasticity and stimulates appetite in cancer and HIV patients. Certain cannabis substances have also been found to kill cancer cells in the lab. “I believe there is heaps of research out there if people take the trouble to read it they will find the research is more than adequate,” said Emeritus Professor Laurence Mather from the University of Sydney. Medicinal cannabis supplier Langdon Brown, also known as The Don, said he had 150 customers in Queensland taking cannabis oil for conditions like cancer, epilepsy and chronic pain. He said supply was difficult because growers were reluctant to have more than six plants for legal reasons. PALASZCZUK: Queensland to trial medicinal marijuana One millilitre of Mr Langdon’s cannabis oil sells for $110 which he said could last about one month for a patient taking one drop per day. But he recommended cancer patients consume 2ml a day for two months equating to $220 a day or $13,200 for two months. “If medicinal cannabis was legalised, prices would come down 50 per cent guaranteed,” Mr Langdon said. The Queensland Government has ordered trials of medical cannabis for children with epilepsy which could start next year. Health Minister Cameron Dick said Queensland Health was looking into the global research “to see if we can accelerate the process. We want to ensure any medical cannabis product used by children is safe and effective”.  Meanwhile Greens, LNP, Labor and Liberal Democrat senators have co-sponsored a forthcoming Bill to regulate the growing, manufacturing and distribution of medicinal cannabis nationally. Bill co-sponsor and Greens Leader Senator Richard Di Natale said there was “already overwhelming international evidence that medicinal cannabis can provide relief from certain conditions. Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy have been needlessly denied access to this kind of medical relief for far too long”. The Australian Medical Association, which recognises the therapeutic potential of cannabis, backs more clinical trials.  President of the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation, Dr Alex Wodak AM, said people were suffering while “slow progress” was made towards legalising medical marijuana. He said many terminal patients were forced onto the black market, fearing legal repercussions. “I’m all in favour of being slow and careful but it seems hard to justify the rate of progress,” said Dr Wodak.

The bill aims to treat medicinal cannabis, prescribed by a doctor, in the same way as any other prescription medication under the Road Safety Act. It would mean driving laws are changed, with the government to establish an implementation taskforce that will work with doctors, legal experts and MPs around those changes.  The taskforce will then report back to parliament by December 18. “The average medicinal cannabis patient is a 55 year old woman. These patients gain great relief from their medication but should be able to drive their kids to school in the morning,” Ms Patten said. But the move was met with stern opposition from the Liberal Party, with Member for Northern Metropolitan Region Craig Ondarchie likening the government’s approval of the bill to an episode of The Block.  “You get to vote on it before the job is complete – there is still a lot of work to be done on this bill before it should come to the house for approval,” he said.  Opposition health spokeswoman Georgie Crozier said the bill was “somewhat risky”. “It’s really about the inability to test that impairment level,” she said. “We can do that with blood alcohol but the ability to detect the presence of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) is very difficult … until there can be that specific test being undertaken then it is somewhat risky.” Medicinal cannabis is generally prescribed for epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, symptom relief in palliative care and symptoms associated with cancer and cancer treatment.

Researchers at Western Sydney University surveyed women with endometriosis in New Zealand and Australia, where 72 per cent of respondents reported self-administering cannabis illicitly. The women self-reported positive outcomes in using cannabis to manage the often painful condition, in which tissue similar to that which lines the uterus grows beyond it causing inflammation and scarring.

Medicinal cannabis was approved for use in Australia in 2016. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has said the majority of patients who seek medicinal cannabis do so for pain management but that the evidence for many painful conditions is still limited. The administration does not consider medical cannabis a ""first-line therapy"" for any illness, meaning other treatments should be considered first. Chief Scientific Officer with the Australian Natural Therapeutics Group and lead author Justin Sinclair said there was still stigma around medical cannabis and he was concerned people were using cannabis without medical supervision.

They were treated for 14 nights with ZLT-101 and for 14 nights with a placebo, with a week-long ‘washout’ period in between. Participants using ZLT-101 reported longer, deeper sleep as well as better quality of life, meaning they felt rested after sleep and were less stressed and fatigued. The oil caused only minor side effects, such as a dry mouth and headache, and these passed quickly for most patients. Director of the UWA’s Centre for Sleep Science, Professor Peter Eastwood, said the trial provided important data to researchers. “This study represents the most rigorous clinical trial ever undertaken to assess the therapeutic potential of medicinal cannabis to treat the symptoms of chronic insomnia,” Professor Eastwood said. “The fact that ZLT-101 treatment achieved statistically significant, dose responsive improvements across a broad range of key insomnia indices is impressive, particularly given the relatively short two-week dosing window.” The Australian Medical Association’s WA branch has been contacted for comment.","May 26, 2020 ...

In fact, though it pains me to say it, it is coming very close to being an outright lie.  Off the back of strong public support for patients like my son Dan, who sought relief from serious disease and symptoms with medicinal cannabis, the government rode the wave of popular opinion, made all the right sympathetic noises, and passed legislation to allow for the cultivation, manufacture, and research into cannabis for therapeutic purposes. That sounds wonderful and I used to feel very proud that Dan’s courage to speak out made some ground for other patients. I thought it a beautiful tribute that the legislation passed on the first anniversary of his death. With the clarity of hindsight, it is a very different view. I now recognise that the government’s decision to gazump the Regulator of Medicinal Cannabis Bill was the first disaster.  This Bill which was predominantly the work of Senator Richard Di Natale with cross-party support from senators Ian Macdonald, David Leyonhjelm and Anne Urquhart had already passed through the Senate’s Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee in 2015. The cross-party Bill recognised the many potential problems with subjecting cannabis to the model of the established Therapeutics Goods Administration (TGA). At the eleventh hour, when the Regulator Bill looked like it would be successful in achieving legislation the government threw caution and common sense to the wind and decided to play politics by introducing their own bill. The Narcotic Drugs Amendment Bill which took the view that they could put a square peg (cannabis) into a round hole (TGA) was tabled and passed instead. This “Clayton’s victory” was quickly followed by breaking the major promise that ­allowed their Bill to pass so quickly. The government had agreed in a trade-off with Labor not requiring the legislation to go to committee, that they would appoint an expert advisory council to guide the writing of the regulations. This never occurred so the regulations have been written without expert advice and now the problems foreseen in the crystal ball of the cross-party committee are becoming crystal clear. The flow-on effect from this first broken promise is enormous. We now have a bureaucratic nightmare which has done absolutely nothing for the patients which it was designed to assist and protect. People often say to me you must be very pleased with how things have progressed, so let me honestly answer that right now: Patients are still criminals. This includes the terminally ill and children with intractable epilepsy. Patients are still reliant on the black market and will be for a long while yet. They are still taking medicine procured from illicit sources which is like playing the lottery — the medicine could be contaminated, each batch is likely to contain different cannabinoids, there is no certainty that there will be a next supply, there is no alternative. The black market is thriving. In fact it cannot meet ­demand and that is compounded by police raids which seize the medicine of patients who are reliant on it. Police are being put in an untenable position. The legislation has been passed yet using cannabis for medical purposes remains a crime. No licences have been approved to begin to cultivate and manufacture. Now I can immediately hear bureaucrats jumping up and down and saying there is a pathway for patients to lawfully access medicinal cannabis. I agree in theory and therefore it is only fair that I touch on that. The Special ­Access Scheme (SAS) provides that pathway, but it is a convoluted process. To begin the process the very sick patient needs to find a doctor who is happy to prescribe cannabis and who has the time to firstly undertake the arduous time-consuming process to become an “authorised prescriber”. Patients are still criminals. This includes the terminally ill and children with intractable epilepsy. Patients are still reliant on the black market and will be for a long while yet. This involves applications to state and federal agencies. Once approved the doctor must then demonstrate the evidence for the patient’s illness. (A little difficult after decades of blanket prohibition).  It should also be noted that there are no doctors in Australia with expertise in cannabinoids. Most doctors are not even aware of the existence of the Endocannabinoid System. The very sick patient then needs to find the product overseas, bearing in mind these products are not allowed to be advertised.  Once found the ­patient must negotiate a price and apply to the TGA to have it approved. They must also apply for federal and state permits to have it imported. And the patient bears the full cost plus the doctor’s costs. * Lucy Haslam is Founder of ­United In Compassion Originally published as Grass grows under bill for medical marijuana","Feb 19, 2017 ...

The Poulters have been pushing for a change in legislation for more than two years as they medicate Lily’s debilitating Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which causes chronic dislocation in her joints. The disorder often leaves her needing wheelchair assistance. She also experiences Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, a condition that can cause sudden intense pain in her limbs. They believe medicinal cannabis will offer better pain relief than her prescribed opiates, which leave the 11-year-old Banksia Grove Primary School student at risk of addiction. Friday’s State Government announcement that medicinal cannabis would become a controlled drug from November 1 and likely available for use from next year had Mr Poulter “absolutely over the moon”. “It’s major progress… I burst into tears, it’s such a big weight off our shoulders, we’ve been fighting for over two years now,” he said. “Lily just has the biggest smile on her face, we can see a light at the end of the tunnel.” While Lily’s doctors were supportive of the Poulters’ treatment hopes, Mr Poulter was aware it would not be as simple as gaining a prescription from a specialist and picking up the drug at the chemist. The doctor would need authorisation from the Therapeutic Goods Administration and a yet-to-be-created Department of Health advisory committee. Mr Poulter also expected it to be expensive initially, given they would have to source it from international companies until Australian farms became established. As he understood it, he said it would mean the drug would not be discounted under Medicare or the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. “It’s going to be fairly expensive, we’re hearing prices of $300 to $1000 for a little vial,” he said. Mr Poulter was hoping the financial pressure would ease by about 2018 when Australian products were expected to become available. “It’s still another 12 to 18 months away before we can really get it going, but it’s a huge start,” he said. WA growers such as AusCann, chaired by former local federal MP Mal Washer, can apply for a licensing permit from next Tuesday. Indicative of Lily’s plight, the aspiring wheelchair basketballer will endure a knee operation next week, which will have her needing more opiates for pain relief. Mr Poulter said it was “only an arthroscope”, but it would still need additional medication. “They’ll have to put her on more (opiate-based meds), which they don’t like doing because it could trigger her tendency to get Complex Regional Pain Syndrome,” he said.","Oct 27, 2016 ...

By night, she takes on a second job in a pub to pay for the medical cannabis that has turned her life around. The 29-year-old, who has had epilepsy since she was 12, pays almost $600 for a month’s supply of Tilray medical cannabis — a cost she is struggling to afford. Ms Merendino said the medicine had transformed her from a skeletal “zombie” on strong medication to control eight or nine seizures a day. Her weight had plummeted to 42kg, with many people assuming she had an eating disorder. Figures show that by last month, the Therapeutic Goods Administration had approved 2339 special access scheme applications for unapproved medical cannabis products, including 568 approvals last month alone. There are 52 doctors across the country who have authority to prescribe medical cannabis but no products are subsidised under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Ms Merendino said that her seizures came on with no warning other than her arm flicking up. “Before I knew it I’d be on the floor and then two hours later I’d wake up and my mum would have me on the bed and I’d be so tired,” she said. “I had medication to control the fits but the side effects were so bad that I had no energy and would have to have a sleep as soon as I got home from work.” While she still took medication to control “blank-outs” — where someone loses awareness for a short time — medical cannabis replaced the drugs that had controlled her fits. “I’m so much healthier now, you can see it in my face and body,” Ms Merendino said. “But I’m paying $450 for a 25-day supply of medical cannabis. “The only way I’ve been able to afford it is because I live at home and sometimes work at night as well — and even then I struggle.” Tilray, one of the biggest global producers of medical cannabis, is lobbying governments to contribute to the cost in the same way they do for other drugs. Vice-president of global patient research and access Philippe Lucas said the company believed there should be reasonable patient access to medical cannabis. “Unfortunately, research has shown that cost is a very real obstacle to access in many jurisdictions, so we work with government regulators and insurers to increase cost-coverage for patients wherever we can,” he said. “We believe that Tilray medical cannabis has met the standard of safety and efficacy to be recognised as a medicine and therefore should not be taxed any differently than other prescription drugs.”","Dec 7, 2018 ...

Perth-headquartered Emerald Clinics is listing on Wednesday after a $8 million capital raising, while shares in West Perth-based grower Little Green Pharma are set to begin trading early next week week after a $10 million initial public offering. The listings come at a difficult time in the industry, which is struggling with a glut of supply globally as legalisation has progressed more slowly than some cannabis backers optimistically predicted. Shares in ASX-listed companies like Auscann Group, Cann Group and Creso Pharma are all a fraction of what they were three years ago. “We did anticipate this coming some time ago – it’s not surprising,” Emerald Clinics chief executive and managing director Dr Michael Winlow said of industry’s difficulties. Dr Winlow told AAP that companies have been putting too much effort into growing pot and not enough into proving the drug is a safe and effective medicine. “It’s the kind of evidence the industry absolutely needs if it’s going to establish itself as a credible therapeutic option,” he said. “What these companies have failed to do is penetrate mainstream medicine.” Emerald has four clinics – in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and the Northern Rivers region of NSW – in which patients can be prescribed medical marijuana under the federal government’s Special Access Scheme. Over 1000 patients have been treated since Emerald’s first clinic opened in December 2018, mostly for chronic non-cancer pain but also dozens of other conditions including side effects from chemotherapy, cancer pain and Alzheimer’s. The goal is to treat patients while gathering anonymous, real-world data from patients that could be presented to regulators. Emerald has closed patient-data deals with customers including Spectrum Therapeutics, the medical division of the world’s largest cannabis company, Canopy Growth. In the year ending June 30, it had revenue of $109,909 and expenses of $2.68 million, and expects to use the funds from the listing to expand into the United Kingdom. Little Green Pharma meanwhile describes itself as a vertically integrated medicinal cannabis business that was the first to offer Australians locally grown medicinal marijuana products, in August 2018. More than 4,500 bottles of its three different oil-based oral medicinal marijuana have been dispensed to more than 1,400 patients across Australia, and Little Green Pharma recently received its first commercial orders for 2,400 units from Germany. In fiscal 2019 it had a loss of $5.5 million on $248,500 of revenue, but says its first-mover advantage and nearly two years of successful cannabis cultivation give it an advantage over competitors. Little Green Pharma has an indoor growing facility in Western Australia that it is expanding so it can cultivate more than 110,000 bottles of medicinal cannabis oil per year. As of January 31, over 31,000 Australians have been approved to use medicinal cannabis products under a special access scheme the government set up in 2016.

Curtin University’s School of Biomedical Sciences is poised to start testing cannabis formulations against human pancreatic cell cancer lines grown in the laboratory. The project is in collaboration with Zelda Therapeutics, a Perth-based biopharmaceutical company, which will import the cannabis from Canada. The research will examine the usefulness of cannabis formulations as standalone treatments and in combination with existing chemotherapy drugs, such as Abraxane. Pancreatic cancer, the 11th most prevalent cancer diagnosed in Australia, is difficult to detect in the early stages and is highly aggressive. Only 6 per cent of sufferers survive for five years following diagnosis. “After years of slow progress in the field of pancreatic cancer treatment, we hope to finally open the path to new therapies for pancreatic cancer,” Curtin University’s Professor Marco Falasca said. Zelda said the project will seek to replicate the success of its cannabinoid formulations on breast cancer. In November, Zelda announced the results of an experimental trial, claiming its THC-rich medical cannabis formula was as effective in reducing breast cancer tumour growth in mice as chemotherapy drug Lapatanib. The results, which saw its share price surge, still require clinical trial validation. According to Zelda, “there is a growing body of evidence that whole plant cannabinoid extracts can impede cancer growth and potentially render the tumour more responsive to chemotherapeutic agents.” Zelda’s executive chairman Harry Karellis hoped the pancreatic research would demonstrate anti-cancer activity. “Professor Falasca has an established reputation in studying pancreatic cancer using cannabinoids in Italy, the United Kingdom and more recently, in Australia,” he said. “Up until now he has been working with synthetic cannabidiol and generating positive data in vitro and in vivo. Our program will be testing our whole plant extracts in his established cell assays and depending on results can progress into further work in animal models.” Zelda has also partnered with leading cancer researchers at Complutense University of Madrid in Spain. The company also has ties to AusCann, which as revealed by The Sunday Times last month, has plans to cultivate and manufacture medicinal cannabis in WA. For the cancer trials, AusCann will source the research material from its Canadian partner Canopy Growth Corporation, the world’s biggest medical cannabis cultivator. We hope to finally open the path to new therapies for pancreatic cancer.","Jan 8, 2017 ...

But Police Minister Peter Chandler said there would be no leniency for medicinal marijuana smokers when the new laws come into effect on February 1. Drivers face lengthy driving bans and thousands of dollars in fines for returning a positive test. The NT News has spoken to cannabis smokers worried they will be penalised despite not being under the influence of the drug. One casual drug user said there was a subculture of Territory cannabis smokers who used cannabis responsibly. He said there was a difference between casually smoking cannabis and driving after smoking meth. “We are organised people. We have got a family and kids. When the kids go to bed at night we’ll indulge in a chuff,” he said. “There’s quite a few people that indulge in marijuana frequently and no other drug. They enjoy that and they are no harm to the community. “We’re made to be instant criminals straight away.” A medicinal cannabis user said he used the drug to ease the pain of his illness. But Mr Chandler made no apology for the tough stance. “There will be a zero tolerance approach to drivers who drive under the influence of drugs. Any trace of prohibited drugs in your system will result in a penalty – cannabis, ice or ecstasy, no drug is excluded,” he said. “All drugs are illegal and if you’re caught risking your own life and the lives of others you will be prosecuted. There is a simple solution. Don’t take drugs. “Cannabis – even medicinal cannabis – isn’t legal in the Northern Territory. If you’re driving under the influence of cannabis then you’re both a fool and committing a crime.” Drug drivers face two categories of penalties if they return a positive test and a lab analysis confirms the presence of illicit substances. A driver caught with traces of drugs in their system is issued with a $400 on-the-spot fine. For a second offence, drivers face a minimum three-month disqualification, a $1200 fine or six months in prison. However, drivers face a six-month driving ban, a $1500 fine or 12 months in prison if caught driving under the influence of illicit substances. The penalty doubles for a second offence.

Investors who bought Phytotech shares for 20 cents each just before Christmas saw their investment skyrocket to 42 cents during their first day of trading on Thursday. Phytotech’s founder Ross Smith and managing director Boaz Wachtel, both of whom are major shareholders in the company, scooped more than $300,000 in paper profits. The Perth-based company’s stock market listing comes as it looks to break into the multi-billion dollar US market, where medicinal marijuana is legal in several states. Phytotech is also targeting Canada, Israel and Europe and hopes medicinal cannabis treatment will become available in Australia as political pressure mounts to conduct trials of the illegal drug. “The dominoes are falling globally,” Phytotech founder and executive director Ross Smith told AAP from his company’s offices in Israel. “Australia could potentially be a world centre for growing cannabis in much the same way we’re a world leader for growing medical opium.” Advocates of medicinal cannabis say the drug should be available legally in pill form to treat terminally ill patients, children with epilepsy, and cancer patients suffering from chemotherapy-related nausea. Phytotech plans to work with farmers in the US and Uruguay to grow indoor and outdoor marijuana crops for medicinal purposes. It estimates the global cannabis industry is worth up to $US100 billion. In Australia, the NSW government is spending $9 million on three trials for medicinal cannabis, but Mr Smith believes Victoria is most likely to legalise the drug once federal laws governing distribution and production are passed. Mr Smith acknowledged the majority of Australia is governed by conservative governments, but said lawmakers could not ignore the legalisation of medicinal cannabis in 23 US states and seven European countries. “This is happening,” Mr Smith said. “What a pity that once it becomes legal in Victoria and NSW that people in other states will have to move interstate to treat their child with seizures.” Prime Minister Tony Abbott supports state-based trials of the drug, but has dodged suggestions of a national experiment. A private members bill seeking the formation of a regulator to oversee the production and distribution of medical cannabis is expected to be debated in the Senate as early as next month. Demand for Phytotech shares was strong after it released documents regarding its stock market float last December. It originally planned to raise $5 million through the issue of shares to investors, but strong demand forced it to issue another $900,000 worth of stock. Options Xpress market analyst Ben Le Brun said Phytotech had made a spectacular share market debut, with just under 13 million shares changing hands. “It’s got high prospects for growth overall,” he said. “The research suggests that the relief the drug gives people suffering all manner of conditions can’t really be doubted.” Originally published as Marijuana company starts on a high","Jan 23, 2015 ...

As the Federal Government prepares to allow commercial medicinal cannabis crops, a Roy Morgan study has found overwhelming public support for cannabis-based medicines to be legally prescribed to patients with serious illnesses.  But there appears to be little public appetite for the Federal Government to copy the example of incoming Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, who wants to legalise the recreational use of marijuana in his country. The survey found that 89 per cent of South Australian residents and 91 per cent of Australians believed the medicinal use of marijuana should be legal. Roy Morgan Research chief executive Michelle Levine said 92 per cent of Liberal and Nationals voters, 94 per cent of Labor voters and 97 per cent of Greens supporters believed medical marijuana should be legal. “Unlike some social issues, legalising medicinal marijuana is widely favoured by electors of different political persuasions and age groups, which really tells us its time has come,’’ Ms Levine said. “Not surprisingly, Australians aged 50-plus are the strongest supporters, as this group is most susceptible to several of the conditions that medicinal marijuana can provide relief from.’’ The NSW Government is preparing to run a series of medical marijuana clinical trials for patients with serious illnesses. The Victorian, Queensland and ACT Governments also want patients in their states to be able to participate in clinical trials and New Zealand Government ministers have also expressed interest in the research. The SA Government intends to monitor the progress of the trials but will not participate at this stage. Australian Medical Association SA President Janice Fletcher yesterday said there was evidence to suggest pharmaceutical cannabis had medicinal value for a small number of people in specific circumstances. There had been encouraging evidence about the effectiveness of the drug in controlling spasticity in patients with Multiple Sclerosis and nausea and vomiting in cancer patients. “The AMA supports that therapeutic cannabinoids that are scientifically evaluated to be safe and effective be made available to patients for whom existing medications are not as effective,’’ Dr Fletcher said. The Federal Government will introduce a bill into Parliament next month to enable the licencing of medicinal cannabis crops. Federal Labor wants patients with serious illnesses to be given access to medicinal cannabis prescribed by doctors. Ms Levine said only about 30 per cent of Australians believed the recreational smoking of marijuana should be legal. “This demonstrates that Australians understand that smoking and consuming marijuana for medicinal purposes are two very separate issues,’’ she said. The Roy Morgan survey of 644 Australians aged 14 years and over was conducted last week. The new Canadian centre-left Liberal Government plans to legalise cannabis.

We think this is an important step forward. “Our commitment as a state is to support the use of medical cannabis for children, particularly children with drug-resistant severe epilepsy. “We are working with NSW on the development of those trials. “When it comes to children we need to be very careful that any drug or pharmaceutical that’s used is safe and effective and has limited side effects and hopefully no side effects at all.” Mr Dick said the government hoped to begin trials in Queensland in 2016 off the back of the NSW trials, which are expected to report back by the end of next year. But he said the department had been tasked with looking into what was happening overseas as well. “Work is happening,” Mr Dick said. “I have asked the department to have a look at the research that has been done elsewhere to see if that can help accelerate the process here in Queensland.” Originally published as Plan to fast-track medical cannabis trial","Jul 27, 2015 ...

The world-leading clinical trial, aimed at improving the quality of life for thousands of people with dementia, will be undertaken by the university’s Institute for Health Research in partnership with Israel-based company MGC Pharmaceuticals. The 14-month clinical trial will involve 50 people aged 65 and older who have mild dementia and live in an aged-care facility. The trial will use medicinal cannabis in the form of a mouth spray containing cannabidiol ingredients that have been found to help with nausea, mild anxiety and provide anti-inflammatory benefits. Chief investigator Amanda Timler said medicinal cannabis “works well with a lot behavioural and neuro-psychotic symptoms associated with dementia, such as aggression and agitation”. “Medicinal cannabis is also thought to increase appetite as well as improve sleep cycles,” she said. More than 447,000 Australians live with dementia and more than 1.5 million Australians are involved in their care. Treatments for behavioural and psychiatric symptoms of dementia are limited and there have been no new treatments for about 15 years. IHR director Jim Codde said the aim of the study was to improve the quality of life for people with dementia and Alzheimer’s.

The two-year-old, who can suffer up to 1400 seizures a day, has Dravet syndrome — a rare and catastrophic form of epilepsy.  She has been hospitalised nine times in the past four months and faces a bleak ­future with severe retardation, disability and premature death likely. “We dread what the next seizure will do to her,” father Michael says. “She even has seizures in her sleep.” Mr Lambert said research had revealed medical cannabis was enormously beneficial for epileptics because of its main ingredients THC and CBD. A CBD strain, known as Charlotte’s Web, was developed in America to help Dravet sufferer Charlotte Figi, who had been suffering from 300 seizures a week ­before starting on the drug. Mr Lambert said Charlotte now suffered from only two or three seizures a month, no longer needed a feeding tube and could walk and talk. “We estimate Katelyn needs about 3g of Charlotte’s Web cannabis a day, about $12,000 a year on today’s market,” Mr Lambert said. “That’s about 20 plants per annum to potentially save her life and save NSW taxpayers a fortune. We use lignocaine from cocaine, we use morphine from opium, why can’t we use THC and CBD from cannabis?” Mr Lambert has approached Gosford state Liberal MP Chris Holstein to argue the case to legalise medical cannabis in NSW. Tamworth National Party MP Kevin Anderson plans to introduces a Private Member’s Bill, possibly as soon as the September sitting. “It’s a no-brainer. Vote yes to help sick people dying from cancer or epileptics or vote no to continue the present system where medicine is either grow by drug dealers or families are criminalised for giving their loved ones medicine,” Mr Lambert said. Mr Holstein said he would consult with people affected and the wider electorate before making any decision. “I met the Lambert family in my office a few weeks ago and after meeting their daughter and hearing their story I am sympathetic to their situation,” Mr Holstein said. “I will be adopting a positive approach to any proposed legislation and looking closely at the safeguards and regulation of medicinal cannabis as it applies to this and similar extreme cases in the state. “I believe it is our responsibility as legislators to assess the evidence put before us by the medical experts, listen to the people affected and their families and consult within the wider electorate.’’ Originally published as Marijuana the key to little Kat’s survival","Aug 19, 2014 ...

Labor leader Mark McGowan would say it was more to do with good political judgment and policy rather than luck, but it seems the political gods have smiled on the wannabe premier as he fights for the legalisation of medicinal marijuana for the terminally and chronically ill.  McGowan took a huge gamble putting this controversial topic on the political agenda in WA – and so far, it has paid off. Even Prime Minister Tony Abbott agrees with his stance on legalising medicinal cannabis and members of the community have applauded the move.  But it is worth noting that not long ago that the WA Labor Party was painted by the Liberals and sections of the community as the mob who were “soft on drugs” for introducing new cannabis laws which effectively allowed anyone caught with small quantities of the drug to escape police prosecution – and hence, a criminal record.  McGowan’s Labor Party again risked being accused of being “soft on drugs” in July this year when the Opposition leader put legalising pot for medicinal purposes in the public domain by telling Labor’s state conference: “I believe it’s appropriate to give doctors the option of prescribing medicinal cannabis when other medications have failed.”  Informed sources told me this week McGowan had gone against the advice of his office by announcing his controversial cannabis plan at the conference.  To add weight to his argument for change, McGowan reverted to a story he had told State Parliament in 2010 of a young bloke whom he used to visit who had slowly died of a terminal disease in a nursing home.  The young man was wasting away in pain and sought relief through cannabis, McGowan told the state conference. What did I think of McGowan’s announcement? I thought he had made a terrible mistake.  I remember thinking at that time that McGowan would be heavily criticised for wanting to legalise cannabis, albeit for medicinal purposes and that he had wasted a golden opportunity to receive positive media coverage on an important state issue: like state debt or traffic congestion.  The risk for McGowan was the imputation that he was somehow trying to make dope sound respectable. The risks associated with cannabis use are well documented.  The National Cannabis Prevention and Information Centre warns “numerous studies” show smoking cannabis can result in addiction, adverse psychological effects, delusional thoughts, persistent cognitive decline and physical problems like circulation and lung problems and some cancers.  It warns that cannabis is an “addictive drug” and that “consuming cannabis has been shown to cause cognitive impairment as well as increasing vulnerability to psychological harms among users”.  But the NCPIC also says: “Pharmaceutical preparations of cannabis can be delivered safely, are tested and subjected to strict regulatory control both in their preparation and administration, thereby reducing the harm potential both to the user and the wider society.”  There is an old saying which goes: The devil is in the detail. We really won’t know whether the legalisation of cannabis for medicinal purposes is a good idea or not until the nitty gritty of such new laws are drafted – and ultimately trialled.  But what we can’t afford is for the youth of today – the adults of tomorrow – to grow up thinking that pot from the guy up the road is all of a sudden legitimate and safe.","Sep 20, 2014 ...

The Australian Medical Association Victorian branch was among health groups, patients and families to throw their support behind the use of cannabis in “exceptional circumstance”, in submissions made to the Victorian Law Reform Commission. The medical group called for a national approach to legislation and more research, but discouraged patients smoking the drug to avoid lung damage. Other groups to write to the commission included Cancer Action Victoria, the Legal Institute of Victoria and The Australian Lawful Use of Cannabis Alliance. Families needing the illegal drug for loved ones suffering from car-crash injuries, illness and chronic pain wrote to the inquiry describing a fear of being prosecuted for using marijuana.  Multiple submissions detailed raids by police after turning to the illegal drug for treatment. Mother of three Joylene Donovan pleaded for legal reform to treat her 11-year-old daughter, Ava, who has Dravet Syndrome — a rare and life-threatening form of epilepsy. “I would give anything to be able to have the opportunity to trial medical cannabis for Ava, given the success we are seeing worldwide for many children with the same condition as Ava,” she wrote. “I see it as another option, another treatment and possibly a life changer for her.” The commission is being headed by QC Ian Freckelton and will hand a report to the Victorian Government on August 31. alex.white@news.com.au Originally published as Health groups give marijuana green light","Aug 20, 2015 ...

Sujoy Roychowdhury was banned from possessing or prescribing medicinal cannabis, The Australian reports. Under his conditions, employers could be required to file monthly reports to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) to confirm he complies with the sanctions. Dr Roychowdhury was employed via Health Care Australia (HCA), which was contracted to administer COVID-19 vaccines across NSW and Queensland. A spokesman for HCA told NCA NewsWire that while it was aware of the restrictions on Dr Roychowdhury’s licence, they did not bar him from administering the doses. “The doctor involved in the nursing home incident is a registered medical practitioner on the APHRA register and there were no conditions on the doctor’s registration which prevented him ­administering vaccinations,” they said. Dr Roychowdhury administered four times the recommended dosage to two elderly patients, a 94-year old woman and an 88-year old man, in Brisbane on Tuesday. He was stood down after a nurse noticed and reported the mistake. Neither patient suffered any ill effects, though the man had lifesaving heart surgery delayed as a precaution. Dr Roychowdhury had failed to complete mandatory online training before administering the doses, and HCA CEO Jason Cartwright agreed to step aside while an investigation was launched. The government was infuriated by the bungle, which deputy chief medical officer Michael Kidd lashed as “unacceptable”. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said she was “very upset” over the error. “This doctor had no training – now we have two elderly people that could be anyone’s mother or father, or aunt or uncle, that are now in hospital,” she said. “I don’t want to see this happen again. Let’s make sure the training happens. It’s too crucial.” HCA initially informed the federal government Dr Roychowdhury had completed his online training, before changing that advice. The government was infuriated by the development, which forced Health Minister Greg Hunt to correct the record in parliament. But Prime Minister Scott Morrison played down the incident, saying while hiccups were unavoidable in any “vaccination program of this scale”, measures were in place to correct them. The first week of Australia’s vaccine rollout was hit by two bungles, but the Health Department says vaccine wastage is much lower than expected. Picture: Sam Mooy / Getty Images “Where things don’t go completely to plan, they’re quickly addressed, as you’ve seen happen this week,” he said. The comments came just hours before a second bungle was revealed. On Friday, 150 doses of the vaccine were discarded because it could not be guaranteed they were stored at the correct subzero temperature. The incident occurred after the doses were erroneously delivered to a Melbourne aged care centre, which received double the required number of doses. A statement from the Department of Health said the level of vaccine wastage in the rollout’s first week was 0.15 per cent, far lower than expected.

This week it was revealed there is a support for a cross-party Federal Bill that could see medical cannabis legally grown and prescribed to patients as early as next year. So far, so good. But I fear the devil may be lurking in the detail and that the move might have missed some parts that matter. Importantly, because they have been so slow and apply to only a small group, the positive changes will make little immediate difference to most who are currently accessing medical cannabis illegally. Their quality of life will depend for a while yet on them staying on the dark side. Greens leader Senator Richard Di Natale announced on Monday that the Bill to create a regulator for medicinal cannabis for certain conditions had been drafted and would be put before the Senate for a vote in November. It is said to have initial support from the Prime Minister. Victoria and NSW state governments have indicated that they want to get moving on legalising medical cannabis, but a federal regulatory scheme is required to issue grower licences and allow doctors to prescribe it. Queensland will be a kind of offsider, joining in on any ventures the southern states start. The moves this week effectively acknowledge the benefits of medical cannabis but still do not legalise the substances and the supply lines those who use it have found to work. And it severely restricts who will be allowed to have it. So, in effect, the move might be positive for the future, but troubling for the present. The Victorian Government has pledged to set up an Office of Medicinal Cannabis by the end of the year to oversee research, development and the dispensing of cannabis products through pharmacies to patients with a prescription from a medical specialist. This troubles me as the appointment time lag can be excruciating for those suffering and the system is contingent on the doctors being more inclined to prescribe medical cannabis than their pharmaceutical of choice. Scientific evidence shows cannabis to be a plant of miraculous properties. It worries me that nature’s gift must be processed, controlled and taxed to be available. But at least governments have pointed their feet in the right direction and have taken one step. The science has been accepted elsewhere in the world. Twenty-three states in the US allow medical cannabis. In August, the National Cancer Institute, part of the US Department of Health, updated its website to include confirmation that cannabis has killed cancer in laboratories. The update also says cannabis can be superior to conventional medicines in anti-tumour activity, neuropathic pain management, appetite stimulation and nausea control. Acceptance of the medical benefits is writ large by the highest health authority in that land. I have seen first-hand the positive effects of medical cannabis on a person precious to me with cancer. I have had to deal in whispers and private messages to illegally find a product others had found mercifully effective. The people I dealt with in securing a medical cannabis supply are not criminal characters. They were a mother who had battled breast cancer, a man who nursed his beloved wife, a nutritionist whose sole objective was to restore health: all forced to go outside the law for a treatment that is proven to have health-giving effects. This is not pot. There is no smoking involved. It does not get a person high, but it certainly does ease nausea, seizures, pain, numbness, stinging and, in my experience, tumour size. It is natural, miraculous and should be legal. It needs to be treated with respect and central to the required shift is a change in terminology. For starters, it is cannabis, not marijuana. Cannabis is the Ancient Greek scientific term, mentioned by Herodotus more than 2400 years ago. In Australia, marijuana is grubby, a slang term stolen from Mexico. And we need to start referring to cannabis as a medicine, not a drug, because the overtones of the words are different: medicine is a product that treats or prevents disease; drugs are a chemical substance that has a biological effect. Importantly, while tobacco, alcohol and prescription pain killers — all legal — kill people by the thousand, no one has ever been documented as having died directly from a cannabis overdose. No one. Medical cannabis gives new life to those suffering — and it is past time this natural wonder was made freely legal. fclintonj@optusnet.com.au Originally published as Cannabis is a medicine, not a drug","Oct 15, 2015 ...

Struck down by a degenerative nerve condition, Marilyn Irving’s body would be racked by spasms so violent she was physically spent and struggled to breathe. Her husband Andrew was desperate to find a solution and turned to medicinal cannabis — said to have strong pain relief qualities, but illegal in Tasmania. The Hobart area couple say a regular regimen of taking medicinal cannabis oil drops has been life-changing. The spasms have stopped, Marilyn is sleeping well and gaining strength. “My wife is a living example of the benefits of this natural drug,” Mr Irving tells the Sunday Tasmanian.  “We are not criminals — we have the right to use medication that works.” Tasmania’s peak medical body acknowledges anecdotal evidence of cannabis being useful in pain relief and helping to treat illnesses such as multiple sclerosis and cancer. The public debate about legalising the drug for medicinal purposes is escalating. However, Australian Medical Association Tasmanian president Tim Greenaway says more research is needed before the association could support any widespread prescription of cannabis. “When all drugs are developed, very careful trials are conducted before any mass rollout,” Dr Greenaway said. The medical fraternity also has concerns about how a doctor would accurately prescribe medicinal cannabis for a patient. “There is no standard dose of cannabis — it’s trial and error. Each plant can provide drug doses hugely different — so smoking it one time may work, another time it may fail and another time it may make you sick,” University of Newcastle’s Professor Nick Talley said. The Australian Medical Association supports the current trials being undertaken in NSW and Victoria and will look closely at the results.  Dr Greenaway said research should be conducted in Tasmania as well. In Hobart last Wednesday, a forum organised by the Labor Party was told there was an unstoppable momentum growing around Australian for legislative change to cannabis. The audience, made up of users and suppliers of medicinal cannabis products, expressed frustration at how long the process was taking. As delays continue, normally law-abiding citizens were turning to the black market to get relief, the forum heard. The Victorian Government has pledged to set up an Office of Medicinal Cannabis by the end of the year to oversee research, development and the dispensing of cannabis products. The Victorian model is expected to see the drug being dispensed through pharmacies to patients with a prescription from a medical specialist.  Members of the public would be forbidden from growing their own cannabis plants and a licence system, similar to the poppy industry, would be established to govern cannabis growers. At the Hobart forum there was a clear tension between the push for a safe, government-regulated supply of cannabis-based medicines and people’s desire to grow their own for medicinal use. Federal Labor assistant health minister Stephen Jones said a national framework would be better than states going it alone, to avoid inconsistencies across borders. Australian Medicinal Cannabis (AusCann) has been hampered by red tape in its attempts to grow a trial crop on Norfolk Island. AusCann managing director Elaine Darby hopes the Regulation of Medicinal Cannabis Bill, which would establish a body to provide licences and regulate supply of medicinal cannabis products, will pass through federal Parliament. “It appears to have bipartisan support and we hope it is passed by the end of the year,” Ms Darby said. “Of course then individual states would have to pass legislation to allow medicinal cannabis to be grown and used in their communities, but we could move ahead in territories like the Norfolk Island and Christmas Island. “Hopefully what has happened in Victoria will spur Canberra on. It really is time for change. “In the interim we will continue research and development work with the Murdoch University in Perth.” Tasmanian Health Minister Michael Ferguson says the Government remains committed to a national, science-based and compassionate approach to the medical use of cannabis-defined products. Mr Ferguson said a meeting was held in Hobart last month between NSW Chief Scientist and Engineer Mary O’Kane, who is in charge of the NSW cannabis trial, and senior representatives of Tasmania’s Health Department. “The meeting explored ways Tasmania can be involved in the trials in NSW. This is a co-operative, evidence-based approach consistent with the recom-mendations of the Legislative Council inquiry into this issue,” Mr Ferguson said. How long it will take to decide if Tasmanian legislation will be changed is still unclear. A Burnie man told the Sunday Tasmanian he had turned to cannabis oil after being diagnosed with terminal liver cancer in August last year. He imported the oil from interstate at a cost of $1200 a month. “I would use a syringe and squeeze a dose about the size of a grain of rice on my finger and rub it around my cheeks so it was quickly absorbed into the bloodstream,” he said. In October, the 57-year-old was in hospital in Melbourne being tested before receiving chemotherapy treatment for his cancer. To his surprise, and that of his specialists, the cancerous tumour had disappeared. He said the specialists would not entertain the thought that the use of cannabis oil was behind his remarkable recovery. “They called it spontaneous remission but acknowledged they had never seen it happen before,” he said. The man said he did not feel comfortable speaking openly about the issue because the use and possession of cannabis was still illegal in Tasmania and he was about to start a new job.  “We grow opium here which is manufactured into highly addictive drugs, yet using this herb that has grown on this planet for millions of years to treat yourself is illegal,” he said. “It just doesn’t make sense.” Tasmania Police said the possession and personal use of any cannabis product was illegal under the Misuse of Drugs Act. “Any form of illegal activity cannot be condoned by police. However, the active pursuit of people who reasonably claim to be taking cannabis products for medical purposes is not an operational priority for Tasmania Police,” Acting Commissioner Scott Tilyard said. USERS of medicinal cannabis are often reluctant to speak about their cases. Cannabis remains an illegal product, regardless of its use, and people taking it to ease pain or control medical symptoms fear for their career and their reputation if they speak up. Natalie Daley, of Ulverstone, and Andrew Irving, of Dromedary, have become advocates for the push to legalise medicinal cannabis in Tasmania because they are brave enough to put themselves forward. Mrs Daley, a mother of three, is living with adrenal gland carcinoma that has now moved to her lungs. She says her appetite and energy — sapped by chemotherapy treatments — has returned since she started taking cannabis oil capsules. Mrs Daley received hundreds of messages of support when she started a petition last year to lobby the State Government to legalise the use of cannabis for medical reasons. “There is a groundswell of public support now and I have a good feeling about it,” Mrs Daley said. “There is a lot of evidence out there and I have heard so many stories about how cannabis has helped people but people have been too scared to speak out. I was too, but we need to be a voice for change.” Andrew and Marilyn Irving have also spoken publicly about the benefits cannabis has provided as Mrs Irving battles a degenerative nerve condition. Mrs Irving’s condition continues to improve and Mr Irving is about to start distributing a newsletter on medicinal cannabis to educate others in the community. “I am glad to be part of this campaign and am a strong advocate,” he said. “Since speaking out I have received at least one phone call a week from others wanting to know how cannabis might be able to help them or a loved one.” – HELEN KEMPTON Originally published as Law keeps drug out of reach","Oct 12, 2015 ...

Daryll Knowles, the owner of Australian Custom Pharmaceuticals, said medicinal ­cannabis could easily be ­imported from Holland and administered in the same way as the current methadone ­program. “It’s not such a tough ­hurdle, the systems are already in place to import narcotics like codeine and morphine, the NSW Ministry of Health ­already has processes in place to distribute these, and ­cannabis could be added to that,” he said. Mr Knowles has followed the plight of 24-year-old Dan Haslam, who has incurable bowel cancer and has fortnightly chemotherapy treatments, which cause severe nausea and weight loss.  Since trying cannabis late last year he has not suffered nausea and has been able to eat normally.  His father Lou, a former drug squad detective, and his mother, Lucy, are forced to break the law to get the illegal drug they call miraculous. Health Minister Jillian Skinner knocked back the ­­­pro-medicinal cannabis recommendations of a cross party committee last year.  “The quality and safety of these products cannot be guaranteed,” she said.  However, the Health Minister said she did support the use of ­prescription pharmaceutical cannabis products that were ­approved and regulated by the Therapeutic Goods ­Administration.  Mr Knowles said the Dutch-based company Fag-ron ­already produced medicinal grade cannabis and exported it to other ­European companies. “The process to get it here is there, it is a standardised ­medicinal grade, it is sterilised and comes in little sealed 5g pots that the Dutch ­government sells for €28 ($40),” Mr Knowles said.  Dan’s mother said she was frustrated by politicians who stood in the way.  “You come up with a solution and they just throw up ­another argument, I don’t care how it happens, it just needs to happen,” Lucy Haslam said.

Cannabis oil from the hemp plants grown in this Hunter Valley crop have been sent to Sydney University for the past year to study in search of a treatment for epilepsy and other conditions. Mr Lambert, a retired financial services billionaire made history last year by donating $33.7 million to Sydney University to set up The Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics.  It was a deeply personal donation because Mr Lambert’s granddaughter suffers a rare form of epilepsy that could kill her.  Now the legacy he hoped to put in place is under threat by law changes as the federal government attempts to control medicinal cannabis.  Mr Lambert said the licensed supplier of the cannabis oil, Ecofibre, will no longer be allowed to supply the university after October 31 because it will then be classified as industrial hemp, not medicinal cannabis.  Industrial hemp has low concentrations of THC, marijuana’s active psychotropic component. Cannabis grown for medicinal purposes will be required to be grown in glass houses. Mr Lambert said the resultant production costs will make an affordable drug expensive. “Imagine the cost of bread and resultant social unrest if we had to grow wheat in a glass house because someone might use it to make alcohol.” Mr Lambert, who is also an investor in Ecofibre, said Sydney University will have to source cannabinoids elsewhere. Last month the state government announced it had been given approval by the Commonwealth to conduct cultivation research which would form the basis of future non-government crops.  The crop will be grown in a $2 million green house at an undisclosed location. Mr Lambert’s four-year-old granddaughter Katelyn suffers from Dravet syndrome, a rare and catastrophic form of epilepsy which leads to up to 1400 seizures a day. Her father Michael is treating her with medicinal cannabis.  Last year Michael was charged with cultivating cannabis to help his daughter. He faces court next month. Ecofibre chief executive Eric Wang said hemp, which they grow in three sites across Australia including the Hunter Valley, still had about 100 useful cannabinoids that could be used for medicine.  Mr Wang said hemp had been caught up in the newly established Office of Drug Control licensing guidelines. “Industrial hemp doesn’t have any narcotic value. If you grow marijuana yes, people can steal it, but we’ve been caught up in this,” he said.  Although a spokeswoman for the Health Department said “no directions or decisions have been undertaken at this time for the cultivation requirements for cannabis,” Mr Wang said the Office of Drug Control (ODC) informed growers of the changes in public consultation sessions held last week through Australia. According to the ODC website, hemp crops and medicinal cannabis crops will have to “maintain strict separation between the two crops”.

Ms Palaszczuk said Queensland would join forces with the NSW Government – which last year announced scientific trials for patients with intractable epilepsy, chemotherapy-­related nausea and end-of-life pain where standard treatments were ineffective. She spoke to NSW Premier Mike Baird about the trials during Friday’s Council of Australian Government meeting in Canberra. “I didn’t want Queensland standing on the sidelines,” Ms Palaszczuk said yesterday.  “I wanted us to be an active participant because I know many Queensland families see real value in this form of treatment.” Ms Palaszczuk said details of the Queensland trial would be worked out during discussions with NSW experts. “This trial is about letting the experts do as much research as possible into this issue so that we can all get a clearer understanding of any clinical benefits medicinal cannabis can provide,” she said.  “I’m especially interested in any benefits this form of treatment can have on kids with severe epilepsy.” The Premier said she spoke with the mother of a boy with uncontrollable epilepsy before flying to the COAG meeting. “All she wants is a government that’s willing to step up and investigate this form of treatment,” Ms Palaszczuk said.  “My Government will make that commitment.” Mr Baird has committed up to $9 million over five years for the NSW trials, with enrolment expected to start next year. Ms Palaszczuk is yet to indicate how much Queensland will contribute. An expert panel chaired by NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant will oversee the trials.  Details about where the me­dicinal cannabis for the trials will be sourced are still be­ing worked out. Use of me­dicinal cannabis is decriminalised in 23 US states, Canada, ­Israel, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and Spain. Epilepsy Queensland ­yesterday applauded the Government’s decision to conduct a trial, describing it as a “significant step”. “The news of the willingness of our government to be open-minded and par­ticipate in medical trials will be very welcome indeed, particularly so for people ­living with refractory epilepsy,” Epilepsy Queensland chief executive Helen Whitehead said. CAUTION: Qld’s ‘wait and see’ approach COMMENT: High time it was legalised “Families who deal with relentless seizures that are not assisted by existing medications, surgery and other treatments will see this as a major step in the future care of their child’s epilepsy. “These families have desperately sought support for medical marijuana in the hope that it could be a possible treatment option for their child, administered with medical support and without fear of persecution.” The trials come as desperate families defy the law to give their children medicinal cannabis oil, hoping it will control their seizures. Some have gone public, saying their children have become seizure free.  Doctors warn the drug will not help every patient with refractory epilepsy and much more research is needed to pinpoint the components in cannabis that may work for some children. CHARLOTTE Miot’s parents have considered giving up their jobs and moving to NSW so she can be treated with medicinal cannabis without the threat of police or child-safety officers knocking at their door. Seven-year-old Charlotte has been in and out of hospital most of her life with seizures caused by the rare disorder Doose Syndrome. Although she takes five epilepsy drugs, they have failed to control her seizures.  She has been admitted to the Lady ­Cilento Children’s Hospital in Brisbane twice during the school holidays alone. “We have started looking at real estate and schools in NSW,” Charlotte’s mother Rebecca said. “We’d like to try medicinal cannabis oil under medical supervision. It may not work but we’d like to at least try it. It would be another option. Without it, we’ve run out of options.” The Miots were heartened by NSW Premier Mike Baird’s move to change police guidelines to allow officers to ­decline to prosecute patients using cannabis products for medical purposes. They were waiting to see the Palaszczuk Government’s response to a petition, lodged in the Queensland Parliament last month, calling for similar protections here. “We would prefer to stay in Queensland,” Ms Miot said.  “We don’t want to have to pack up our lives and start again somewhere else.” She and her husband Mark have welcomed Ms Palaszczuk’s move to include Queensland in medicinal cannabis trials. “I’m impressed that something is actually happening in Queensland,” Ms Miot said.  “We’ve got to do something for these kids. If it’s not Charlotte, it may help the next lot of kids that come through.” The Brisbane nurse said the medical cannabis issue was misunderstood by many in the community.  She said products given to children with drug-resistant epilepsy were ingested as an oil, not smoked. “I’ve even had other nurses ask me: ‘Do you believe if she smokes pot, she’ll be better?’,” Ms Miot said.  “I’ve told them it’s nothing like that. It’s very different.” She said when she asked one of Charlotte’s doctors his opinion about medical cannabis, his response was “no comment”.  “It’d be nice to be able to talk to someone that knew the science behind it and knew how it works,” Ms Miot said. The Miots are hopeful that Charlotte will be included in the Queensland trial. THE Palaszczuk Government should be commended for its courageous stance to trial medicinal cannabis to help the acutely ill.  It will no doubt court controversy, especially with the uninformed who will see it as the start of the liberalisation of drug laws.  Medicinal cannabis use has already been introduced in a number of Western countries, with terrific results. There is strong evidence showing it can reduce severe pain in cancer patients, epilepsy sufferers and those with neurological disease. What this trial does is allow the seriously ill to access medicinal marijuana without the stigma of having to acquire it illegally.  Strict regulations will govern who can and cannot access the drug. With NSW also embracing the trial, it’s a victory for good policy and common sense. Originally published as Premier’s green light to radical health move","Apr 18, 2015 ...

Almost a year ago, I met a young man named Dan Haslam, and the look in his eyes that day is something that will remain with me always. Dan was 23, planning a future with his wife Alyce; to have children and to start a hobby farm. He wanted to talk to me about the use of medical cannabis and what a difference it had made in his battle with cancer. Cannabis oil had allowed him to eat again and gain weight — something that felt a little like a miracle after chemotherapy had robbed him of his appetite.  I soon found out a similar miracle had taken place just a little north from the Haslams in the Stevens household. Their daughter Deisha has a rare form of epilepsy that causes frequent seizure. Conventional medicine did not help. When they started her on cannabis oil they saw almost immediate results. There are few things more humbling than being faced with a parent prepared to do absolutely anything for their child. I saw it with Dan’s parents, Lucy and Lou Haslam, and with Deisha’s arents. There are few things more humbling than being faced with a parent prepared to do absolutely anything for their child. Deisha’s father David passed away from cancer recently, but I was blessed to spend some time with him, to talk about Deisha and her illness. What I now sense is wider fervour, in the community and in minister Pru Goward, to explore what medicinal cannabis may have to offer. If we have the opportunity to bring relief to people in the most difficult of circumstances then I believe government has a responsibility to do just that. It is why we are spending $9 million in trials to further explore the role that cannabis-derived medical products can play in providing relief for a range of patients, including children who suffer from drug-resistant epilepsy.  And it is why my government is investing up to $12 million over four years to establish the Centre for Medicinal Cannabis Research and Innovation, which will act as a beacon for the other states and territories and ensure our research is cutting-edge. We are determined to lead the world in medical cannabis research and we are bringing together the best minds to do the research and prove the science. In speaking with the state premiers last week it is very clear they want to participate in these trials and we have agreement from Queensland and Victorian premiers that patients in those states will be included in the next stage.  It is vital to have these trials so we can find out more about the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes, and so patients and carers don’t have to play pharmacist. Dan’s own dreams of a family and a farm will never be realised. I said my goodbyes to him earlier this year, standing in the dry grass of Tamworth along with his friends and family. But his legacy lives on and this week I am proud to launch Australia’s first medical cannabis trial for terminally ill patients. This is about hope and it is about compassion. Every step we take on medical cannabis will be built on the footsteps Dan left behind — this week we are taking an enormous leap forward. Mike Baird is Premier of NSW.

However, some state MPs said they would not discount looking at liberalising medical marijuana use as more research into its use is conducted. An Advertiser online poll at the weekend showed that an overwhelming 94 per cent of people in supported the cultivation of cannabis for medicinal purposes. Mark Elliot’s daughter, Charlotte, 8, has febrile infection-related epileptic syndrome (FIRES) and at its worst, she endures up to 40 seizures a week. Mr Elliot is campaigning for the use of medical marijuana — in the form of Cannabidiol, which has been distilled from the plant and has no psychoactive properties — to be legalised in South Australia. Premier Jay Weatherill said the government had not had any proposal put to it calling for a change to the “treatment” of marijuana. He would not give a personal view on the issue. State Liberal Leader Steven Marshall also said he had not been involved in any discussions regarding this issue. The Advertiser’s online survey has received more than 2400 votes, with 94.78 per cent in favour of the move. Just under 4 per cent were opposed to it and only 1.5 per cent of readers were undecided. The US states of Colorado and Washingtonhave legalised marijuana, along with the South American nation of Uruguay. Greens MLC Mark Parnell said it was an issue that has been discussed for many years and the party was open to information from the medical science sector. “This is not part of the policy that the Greens are running with this election but we are always open to the best available medical science informing public policy decisions,” he said “That little girl’s story obviously touches a lot of people but it’s not something we’ve put forward as a key priority for this election.” National Campaign Director of the HEMP Party James Moylan said that people across the country were ready for the medicinal use of marijuana, but politicians weren’t. “When you look at how harmful a substance is — that’s how you regulate it,” he said. “The push for cannabis use is not a ‘free for all’, it’s not a recreational use debate. There’s dozens of circumstances where marijuana is a primary medicine and there’s a fair understanding (by society) that cannabis is not a dangerous drug.” In November, The Advertiser reported that the Liberal Party wants to reduce the amount a user can carry — from 100g to less than 25g — without facing criminal charges. At the time, Liberal Party spokesman Duncan McFetridge said the control of marijuana “is something we need to continually emphasise”.

It comes as the doctor asked to treat a sick Victorian boy said he was disappointed by the results of conventional medicine.  But Dr Paul Carter has not been able to prescribe or ­recommend the cannabis for fear he could get into trouble with authorities.  Mernda couple Cassie Batten and Rhett Wallace travelled to Lancefield so Dr Carter could examine three-year-old Cooper and monitor his progress.  The Department of Human Services and police continue to investigate the couple after it was revealed they had added cannabis oil to Cooper’s milk to treat his epilepsy and other conditions.  Victorian Opposition Leader Daniel Andrews wants to legalise the use of medical cannabis in exceptional circumstances. But Health Minister David Davis refused to be drawn into the argument, saying only that drug approval was a matter for the Therapeutic Goods Administration. EDITORIAL: TIME FOR NEW DRUGS DEBATE FAMILY FACES DHS HOME INSPECTION FOR USING CANNABIS OIL TGA spokeswoman Kay McNiece said there was a clear distinction between regulated pharmaceutical products and the use of crude cannabis to ­relieve symptoms. “Decriminalisation of personal use of cannabis where there are clear compassionate circumstances is an option which State and Territory Governments can pursue under their respective drugs and poisons control legislation should they choose to do so,” she said.  While the TGA has approved the use of cannabis-derived drug Sativex for conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Ms McNiece said the TGA was not aware of any drug companies seeking approval for other cannabis-related drugs.  The NSW Government and Opposition have both giving provisional support for legalising the medical use of cannabis under strict controls, while several European nations and 23 states in the US have already authorised medical marijuana.  Marijuana has been widely explored as a treatment for cancer, with some scientist believing it can cause cancer cells to self destruct, potentially make tumours less resistant to treatment, as well as easing chemotherapy side effects.  Clinical use of medical marijuana has also centred on its use to treat chronic pain, while research is continuing on whether it can treat Multiple Sclerosis and Cerebral Palsy by reducing muscle tightening.  Cannabis has also been used to combat epilepsy and lesson seizures and is being explored for its impact on Alzheimers disease. Australian Medical Association Victorian president Dr Tony Bartone backed moves to legalise medicinal cannabis in controlled circumstances.  “There is a growing body of evidence on cannabis as an effective treatment for some types of chronic pain, the control of muscle spasticity, some forms of nausea and as an appetite-stimulant in patients with weight loss due to cancer or HIV,” Dr Bartone said.  “AMA Victoria acknowledges that cannabis is used legally for these medical purposes in places such as Canada, the USA, the UK and Germany.”  Having researched the medical use of marijuana and cannabis for the past 15 years, Dr Jonathon Arnold of the University of Sydney said historical and political stigma was preventing research needed to safeguard and approve emerging medical uses for cannabis in Australia.  “The scientific evidence is pretty strong and you would have to take it on a case-by-case basis,” Dr Arnold said. “It is held back by stigma and conservative approaches and concerns that the voting populous won’t approve of the use of an illegal drug.  “When it comes to medical marijuana we are way behind the US and other countries such as the Netherlands where there are companies which are growing cannabis and providing it to patients in a smart way.”  Drug specialist Dr David Caldicott of the Canberra’s Calvary Hospital supports a tightly controlled legalising of medicinal cannabis, warning thousands of Australians are already using marijuana to overcome symptoms without the scientific checks to see what works.  Dr Caldicott said international studies had established a scientific base for the use of cannabis in treating pain and other symptoms, which he hoped would not all have to be reproduced in Australia.  “The delay is not because we need more science, the delay is reconciling the corner in which people have painted themselves as far as policy is concerned,” Dr Caldicott said.  “This is not a free-for-all, but for people who have a terminal illness who would receive some relieve I think it is quite clear.  “The opportunity is here in Australia to have a fairly strict system where it would be decided by people who are not just practitioners but have knowledge of product and people have to be licensed to use it.”  Originally published as Cannabis a slow burner in medical benefits","Aug 25, 2014 ...

The former Dean of University of Melbourne’s medical school Professor David Penington says the varying potency of cannabis means it will never be marketed as a pharmaceutical. “Cannabis can never be a pharmaceutical agent in the usual sense for medical prescription, as it contains a variety of components of variable potency and actions, depending on its origin, preparation and route of administration,” he says in the latest issue of the Medical Journal Australia published Monday. Three states are currently examining making cannabis available for medicinal purposes and the federal Senate is set to debate a private member’s bill to set up a regulator to oversee the production and distribution of the drug. The NSW government is spending $9 million on three trials examining the use of medicinal cannabis for children with severe, drug-resistant Epilepsy, adults with a terminal illness suffering pain, nausea and vomiting and those with chemotherapy-induced nausea. ACCEPTED: PM has no problem with medicinal cannabis But Professor Penington says a double-blind clinical trial of cannabis is not possible because people would easily become aware whether they were receiving the drug or a placebo, he said. “The clinical trial proposed, if successful, presumes that cannabis would then be approved and regulated as a pharmaceutical substance,” Professor Penington writes. “Cannabis has variable effects on individuals. It will not be possible to determine universally safe dosage of cannabis for individuals based on a clinical trial.” The use of cannabis should be decided by the patient, following medical advice about the condition from which they seek relief, those using it would have to register for it and purchase it from a registered supplier, he said. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews made an election pledge to legalise cannabis oil and tablets for medicinal use by the end of 2015. And a Tasmanian parliamentary committee is examining the issue in that state.  Professor Penington is urging a faster go ahead of medicinal cannabis claiming Australia is “behind the times”. In the US 23 states have legalised use of cannabis for medical conditions, as have Israel, Holland and the Czech Republic, he says. Clinical trials of the drug won’t be useful because they won’t be able to determine a universally safe dosage. “Response to cannabis varies from person to person partly due to genetic variation among users, he said. The drug has two active elements THC and CBD. THC produces a powerful euphoria but also hallucinations and psychotic effects. CBD does not give a high but can suppress nausea and pain, he says. There is some evidence cannabis can accelerate the development of schizophrenia and that it is linked to social, behavioural and mental problems when used frequently by people aged 15 to 25. The POINT study of people suffering from chronic problems such as back pain, migraine and arthritis recently found 16 per cent of patients had turned to cannabis to relieve their symptoms even though they’d been prescribed opioids like morphine and oxycodone. Perth-based company Phytotech plans to work with farmers in the US and Uruguay to grow indoor and outdoor marijuana crops for medicinal purposes. It listed on the Australian sharemarket this month. It estimates the global cannabis industry is worth up to $US100 billion ($128 billion). Originally published as Cannabis ‘will never be prescribed’","Feb 2, 2015 ...

NSW Greens senator David Shoebridge announced on Twitter on Monday morning that his office had received advice that all state legislation criminalising cannabis use could be overridden by the commonwealth, with the legalisation of its use a possibility this year. In an explainer released for their renewed campaign, the Greens said advice from constitutional law expert and dean of law at Australian Catholic University, Patrick Keyzer, revealed a pathway to legalising cannabis was through the commonwealth’s power to regulate plant variety rights under section 51 of the constitution. “In short, the commonwealth can regulate the cultivation, licensing and sale of cannabis,” the Greens said, referring to Mr Keyser’s advice. They said this included “all ancillary machinery provisions needed to create a legal national market for cannabis”. “Once this occurs, all state and territory laws contrary to the use of cannabis under the commonwealth laws (being the current state criminal sanctions) would cease to have effect,” The Greens said. So far, only the ACT has decriminalised cannabis. The Greens said they were working with stakeholders to deliver a Bill to parliament that addressed questions such as the number of plants individuals would legally be allowed to grow, taxation measures, and prohibitions on the alcohol and tobacco industry from entering the cannabis industry. Speaking on the Today show on Monday morning, independent Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie dismissed the new legalisation push. “I don’t think I’ll be puffing on that,” she said. Senator Lambie said she wanted to see greater focus on medicinal cannabis being made more available. “I would like to see that fixed. I have a lot of veterans out there at the moment struggling to get scripts to that stuff,” she said.

Ms Spraggon said she had tried everything to get Queensland Health to prescribe the drug but instead she had been told Lady Cilento Hospital would no longer treat her daughter if she continued using it and police searched her house the day Kaitlyn returned from treatment.  She said Queensland Health also refused to renew her daughter’s supply of bottled oxygen — which runs out this month and she’ll die without — in the latest episode of her three-year fight with the government.  A last-minute meeting with Health Minister Cameron Dick on Friday afternoon after One Nation MP Steve Dickson raised her case in Parliament secured Kaitlyn the bottled oxygen but her mother said she could not take her daughter off the illegal drug for fear she would have more seizures, which require CPR and oxygen to keep her alive.  The Ningi single mum said her daughter relied on the THC in raw cannabis oil to ease chronic pain from spinal and hip problems. Without it, the pain triggered severe seizures. She said that Kaitlyn had been prescribed a cocktail of strong opioids and other prescription drugs to deal with her 19 medical conditions but they left her heavily sedated.  Since using cannabis her daughter had been alert and had been interacting with siblings and ready to return to school, Ms Spraggon said. She told Queensland Health doctors and the police and put details on Facebook and said it was the only way to stop her daughter’s seizures.  She said she desperately wanted a cannabis oil with THC prescription for her daughter so she could stop making the drug but had been stonewalled.  “The cannabis oil I’m using, it’s illegal,” Ms Spraggon told The Sunday Mail. “I’ve been open and honest since three years that I’ve put my daughter on it. I haven’t hidden a thing.” She said she had repeatedly tried to have a meeting with Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, who had posed with her daughter at Christmas parties but not scheduled a meeting.  A spokesman for Mr Dick said doctors could prescribe raw cannabis if they believed it would benefit patients but Ms Spraggon was told it was illegal to use cannabis in Queensland outside that framework.  “To date, there have been 20 applications from medical practitioners across Queensland to prescribe medicinal cannabis,” he said. But he said privacy laws stopped Queensland Health from naming those doctors. “Ms Spraggon was advised that under Queensland’s new legal framework an application for medicinal cannabis could be made by Kaitlyn’s paediatric specialist if the specialist considered it could provide a clinical benefit,” he said.

Through the pain, the indignity, the fear. Then imagine hearing of a treatment sanctioned overseas that has worked wonders for children with epilepsy as serious as your little girl’s, so serious that conventional treatments and drugs offer little help. It has brought them back to life. Then imagine being told that if you use it you will go to jail. This is Mark Elliott’s reality. His daughter, Charlotte, 8, has febrile infection-related epileptic syndrome (FIRES) and at her worst can suffer through up to 40 seizures a week. He is campaigning for the use of medical marijuana — in the form of Cannabidiol, which has been distilled from the plant and has no psychoactive properties — to be legalised in South Australia. “It has been proven to reduce seizures where other medicines have been found to be ineffective,’’ Mr Elliott said. “There are studies coming out of the US, where it is legalised in some states, that show this, including one girl who went from having 300 seizures a week to two or three a month.” Charlotte currently takes a cocktail of medications to try to ease her seizures and surgery is not an option. TELL US: Should cannabis for medical purposes be allowed? Because of the intensity of the seizures, children are often left with learning disabilities, behavioural disorders, memory issues, or an inability to move. Sometimes they die. Mr Elliott wants to give his daughter a chance at life. He is advocating for local clinical trials of medical marijuana through a hospital, university, or pharmaceutical company. “I’m looking overseas at the moment for evidence as local neurologists are noncommittal because of the legalities around it,’’ Mr Elliott said. “One of the common arguments against medical cannabis, is that there is no medical evidence to show what the negative effects of medical cannabis use are. “But we are expected to give our kids chemically produced medications which have awful known side-effects. “In Charlotte’s case, her meds cause mood swings, body hair growth, facial deformities, sedation, impaired memory, slurred speech, decreased coordination, confusion, dizziness, headaches. “In Charlotte’s case, and many other cases, chemically produced anti-seizure medications have not stopped her seizures. “Most people end up going underground to get it.” This was the case with Victorian mum Cheri O’Connell who resorted to the illicit substance to treat her severely epileptic daughter, Tara, who was having up to 60 seizures a day and was close to death. One year on and the eight-year-old is seizure free and doctors at one of Victoria’s leading hospitals have acknowledged the “remarkable improvements”. Health experts continue to frown on the use of the marijuana plant, but believe it is time doctors consider prescribing laboratory-created, cannabis-based medications. Dr Scott Smid, from the University of Adelaide, said using cannabis “in its basic form” meant practitioners did not know the strength of the compound. “It’s much safer, and it can be prescribed in a much more controlled environment, if practitioners had access to pharmaceutical preparations (of cannabis),” he said. “They could then make that available on a limited and controlled basis to patients that might have particular diseases that those preparations might be useful in treating. “If there is going to be a debate about the use of cannabis-related medicines in Australia and greater access, it should focus more on those (prescriptions) than homegrown marijuana.” Professor Jason White, head of pharmacy and medical sciences at UniSA, agreed Australia needed to consider the use of medicinal cannabis. “I think we should be looking seriously at the cannabis-based medications that have been developed by pharmaceutical companies overseas,” he said. Dr Smid said there was a lack of “good, proper, rigorous clinics evidence” as to cannabis’ ability to treat pain. “(Even so, prescriptions) are available outside of Australia and they have been used to treat particular types of pain conditions,” he said. “We should do our own trials with pharmaceutical preparations. “I wouldn’t advocate for the access to medical marijuana, more so I’d advocate for greater access to these pharmaceutical preparations in clinical controlled trials.” FACTS ON MEDICAL MARIJUANA MARIJUANA is used to treat conditions including glaucoma, diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, arthritis and asthma. THE use or cultivation of cannabis is illegal in South Australia regardless of medical issues. IN the United States, 20 States including Colorado, California, Alaska and Hawaii permit it with a doctor’s recommendation. A MEDICAL marijuana TV ad broke new ground during the week when it was aired by the biggest cable TV provider in the US. It will be played 800 times during its two week run. IN 1987, South Australia was the first state to decriminalise minor cannabis offences. The possession of up to 100g of marijuana, 20g of hash (the resin from the cannabis plant), one non-hydroponic plant or cannabis smoking equipment leads to a fine from $50 to $150 with 60 days to expiate. DECRIMINALISATION is not the same as legalising. People who do not pay the expiation fine face a criminal conviction if they go to court and are found guilty. IN South Australia, Opposition substance abuse spokesman Duncan McFetridge is campaigning to reduce the amount of cannabis for which a person receives only a fine — and is not charged — from 100g to less than 25g. Carrying more than 25g would become a criminal offence. FAMILY First MLC Dennis Hood wants to increase the maximum penalties for growing up to five plants from $1000 to $2000 and up to 19 plants from $2000 to $10,000.

Underneath her smiling façade, Lily suffers from chronic pain as a result of Ehlers-Danos Syndrome – a disorder which causes her joints to regularly pop out of place. She also suffers from Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, which overstimulates the nerves, making even the slightest touch painful.  The Poulter family are just one of many in WA who are fighting for the legalisation of medicinal cannabis. Lily’s parents Nicole and Lyndon believe the natural form of pain relief would give their daughter a better way of life as well as taking away the risk of addiction to opiate-based drugs. WA Labor leader Mark McGowan has thrown his support behind the Poulter family in their plight. Mr McGowan today said the State Government should be actively campaigning for people such as Lily, with chronic or terminal conditions, to be treated with the medication. Lily was diagnosed with the syndrome when she was three and has been on potentially addictive medication since the age of seven. Mrs Poulter broke down when she said it was a lot for her daughter’s little body to handle. “Sometimes just a rub of the arm or leg can make her pain jump through the roof,” she said. She said the side effects of the opiate medication was her daughter was often “doped” out of her brain and constantly in “la la land”. Mrs Poulter said she had discussed the use of medicinal cannabis with Lily’s surgeon and rheumatologist who agreed it would improve her day-to-day life.  She said the family had even considered making cannabis oil themselves, however wouldn’t because of the legal implications. “We love our kids and to see her go through hell – it hurts,” she said. Lily said she was used to the pain, but if she had one wish she would ask for it to go away.  “I would like to just be a normal kid and have some fun,” she said. WA Health Minister Kim Hames’s position on the legalisation of medicinal cannabis saw a complete turnaround last month. After previously stating the legalisation would send the wrong message to the community, he now says he was supportive of a move to legalise medicinal marijuana. He said he had written to Federal Health Minister Peter Dutton to pledge his support for a trial supported by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Last month, Premier Colin Barnett threw his support behind medicinal marijuana being offered to palliative care patients in tablet form.","Oct 4, 2014 ...

Mr McGowan announced the plan at the state branch’s annual conference on Sunday, where he also said the WA Liberals were on the ropes but more work was needed to knock the Barnett government out of power. Mr McGowan told the party faithful that spray or tablet-form cannabinoids were a compassionate and intelligent solution to the pain, vomiting, nausea and poor appetite endured by people who were terminally or chronically ill. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has approved a spray called Sativex, but it is only available for treating the spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis. For people who are dying, it provides relief sometimes in ways that other drugs don’t, Mr McGowan told reporters. “This sort of support can be provided in the same way that they (doctors) provide morphine, which is a far more addictive and dangerous drug. “The problem with morphine is it can damage organs and some people react very badly to it, it’s very debilitating to them and sometimes didn’t prevent pain.” Mr McGowan stressed he was against recreational cannabis but said he was prepared for accusations the party was soft on drugs. “I am prepared to take on tough issues. I believe in this. This is the right thing to do. “We should not run away from tough decisions just because they’re controversial. “I’ll cop criticism - I’m ready for it - but I’m not going to shy away from difficult or tough decisions.” He appeared mildly optimistic Premier Colin Barnett could be open to the idea, having said in parliament in 2010 that there was some scope for therapeutic use of cannabis. “It was an interesting debate. I would encourage the premier to take this up in a bipartisan fashion rather than reverting to the knee-jerk approach of just opposing everything.” Mr McGowan also announced he wanted to give the judiciary power to grant exemptions under the statute of limitations in cases of child sexual abuse. Currently, victims in WA must take action by the age of 21, but for cases of abuse occurring after November 15, 2005 and involving a parent or close associate of the parent, victims have until they are 25 to take action. “These painful events can take decades to come to the surface,” Mr McGowan said. “Statutory time limits should not be a barrier to justice.” He said a state Labor government would also move to allow class actions in WA to make it easier for such victims to seek justice. Until now, any West Australian that had been part of a class action had joined action pursued in other jurisdictions, he said.","Jul 5, 2014 ...

Nudgee MP Jason Woodforth joined the crowd at the three-day ­festival which included “Joint Rolling Heats”, a workshop titled “Make Your Own Hash” and a “Smoke In”. MP wants medicinal cannabis trial in Queensland Bodybuilding MP’s offbeat weight loss tip Organisers told protesters to make sure they didn’t “blow smoke in the face of police”. Mr Woodforth spoke to the crowd about the medical benefits of marijuana and listened to the pro-recreational smoking arguments.  Last night he told The Courier-Mail that dope smokers were entitled to have their say.  “I am very anti-smoking, but at the same time, how can I have a beer which is a drug and not support their right to have a joint?,’’ he said.  “As politicians we need to have a balanced mind. I may not agree with what you have to say, but I will defend your right to say it. “Why do I have the right to have a beer? They are both drugs, they both have consequences.’’ Mr Woodforth has been a crusader for the push to legalise marijuana for medicinal purposes.  “Let’s explore the medicinal side for pain management and epilepsy and look at the results,” he said. “If we legalised cannabis every epileptic would use it, they deserve that right.’’ Mr Woodforth said industrial uses for cannabis also needed to be looked at.  “Henry Ford built a car using it, sometimes we forget history,” he said. Last July Mr Woodforth appeared on a part-time sex guru’s internet program to slam fluoride as the next agent orange, accusing proponents of water fluoridation of spouting “bull----”. LNP hierarchy is expected to push for him to be disendorsed at the next election.
