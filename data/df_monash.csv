PROJECT ONE: What evidence exists for the effectiveness of medicinal cannabis in 
the treatment of epilepsy? 
 RESEARCH FOCUS: 
Treatment of epilepsy; to search, collect and synthesize evidence to support educational resources and applications for funding  
 RESEARCH BACKGROUND:  
 Within the last 5 years there has been an increase in the popularity and use of multiple forms of marijuana (cannabis) by the public and health professionals for the treatment of a wide range of health conditions. One of these conditions is epilepsy in which for approximately one-third of people, they continue to experience seizures after having tried multiple medications and treatment options. There are also several childhood epilepsies for which seizures cannot be adequately controlled, e.g. Dravet syndrome , Lennox-Gestaut, Doose syndrome, that some parents desperate to find other treatments have tried forms of marijuana. People who take anti-epileptic drugs and experience severe adverse side-effects have also looked into using marijuana for the control of their seizures.   Medicinal marijuana is a derivative of cannabis and produced using the whole cannabis plant. The active substances in medicinal marijuana are known as cannabinoids . In humans, a naturally existing endocannabinoid system exists containing two cannabinoid receptors - CB1 and CB2. Two major ingredients in marijuana are delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) which causes the psychoactive effects of ""getting high""  and cannabidiol (CBD) which is non- psychoactive and is thought to respond to seizure activity. These ingredients bind to the cannabinoid receptors. Medicinal marijuana has a high amount of CBD and a relatively low amount of THC, where as illegal marijuana available ‘on the street’ has the opposite. For over a century the use of cannabis has not been legal except in certain places in the world such as  Colorado, USA.   Although there are multiple anecdotal reports that show medicinal marijuana is effective and beneficial for the treatment of seizures in epilepsy, there is a lack of high qual ity (well-controlled) scientific evidence-based studies. Recently, the Department of Health (Australian Government) have established regulat ions for the cultivation of cannabis for medical and scientific use in Victoria to try to solve this problem and be able to provide a controlled supply for patients who require it for treatment.   The aim of this project will be to document all the existing evidence on the effectiveness of medicinal marijuana to use in the development of an information sheet for people with epilepsy and their families in the community.   2

PROJECT TWO: Assessing the effectiveness of Epilepsy Management Plans 
(EMPs) for people with epilepsy 
 
RESEARCH BACKGROUND:  
 Clinical practice guidelines recommend that ‘all individuals with epilepsy should have a comprehensive care plan that is agreed upon between the individuals, their family and/or carers as appropriate, and primary and  secondary care providers (NICE, 2012).  In 2014, Bellon, Pfeiffer and Maurici carried out a survey in Australia exploring the direct involvement  of people with epilepsy and their family members in the planning and recording of their epilepsy health-care needs and support required in Epilepsy Management Plans (EMPs).    ‘Epilepsy management plans, also termed ‘care plans’ or ‘support plans’, involve collating information on the individual's health-care needs and documenting how family and support staff should respond and support the individual to achieve their personal goals such as social inclusion and management of their epilepsy within a single document…These plans aim at helping people involved with the person living with epilepsy to recognize when seizures are occurring and at giving clear directions about the appropriat e support and first aid to be provided to the person (page 277, Bellon, 2015).’   Only just over half of the respondents reported having an EMP. There were only two- thirds of respondents who had participated in the development of their plan. Although the s tudy found that people with epilepsy wanted to  3 
Version date: 14 December  2016  
 be an active part of their health management team, it did not provide any evidence of the effectiveness of EMPs. This project will look at explore how useful EMPs are to people with epilepsy, their family members and health professionals for supporting their condition.  
RESEARCH PROJECT: 
 The aims of this project are to:  • Develop a short survey  to see how useful Epilepsy Management Plans  are for people with epilepsy, their families and health professionals • Advertise it through the EF website and the Research Newsletter • Collect the findings (data), summarise and write up a research report  • Assist the Research Manager in: o The design/development, research, and maintenance/sustainability of activities and/or project s, resources, and service programs o Assessing relevant services, support, education and training needs of people living with epilepsy. o Related research activities. o Driving organisational growth in service, support, and education and training areas.  o Designing knowledge translation resources and programs.  o Investigating new trends and techniques for service delivery methods and quality.  .

 Professor Terry O'Brien has led a trial using transdermal CBD gel in adults with focal epilepsy. After 6 months of treatment, over half the patients experienced a 50%+ reduction in seizures. Medicinal cannabis-based treatments are emerging as promising complementary approaches to improving seizure control in patients with difficult to treat epilepsy. In 2018 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of a prescription cannabidiol medicine for the treatment of two rare epilepsy diseases that cause treatment resistant seizures, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and Dravet syndrome, that predominantly affect children. Last year the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) approved the prescription, and subsidy on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), of this treatment for patients with Dravet Syndrome. However, there is currently limited high-level evidence for the effectiveness and safety of cannabidiol treatments, and their availability, for adults with common forms of epilepsy. A world-first Phase 2A trial, led by Professor Terry O’Brien, Director of the Monash University Department of Neuroscience and Program Director Alfred Brain, and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA Open), looked at the safety of transdermal cannabidiol (CBD) gel in adults with focal epilepsy, which is the most common form of epilepsy in adults (affecting 60% of patients), and is treatment-resistant in one third of patients. Run across 14 epilepsy trial centres in Australia and New Zealand, the study found that the use of CBD oil in skin patches was safe, well tolerated and accepted by patients. Importantly, while the initial double-blind phase of the trial over 12 weeks of 188 patients did not find a significant difference in seizure frequency between the patients randomised to one of the two CBD oil treatment arms compared to those randomised to receive placebo (inactive) gel, there was a reduction in seizures by at least 50% in more than half of the patients by month 6 of the follow-on open label extension trial. According to Professor O’Brien, this is the first such trial in the world for the efficacy and safety of a medicinal cannabidiol for the treatment of seizure frequency in adults with focal epilepsy. “This is the first randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of a cannabidiol in this common group of adult patients, whose seizures currently cannot be controlled with currently available treatments,” he said. “The original 12-week trial did not show any difference in effect of the gel between the experimental and placebo group, though the trial did show the gel was safe. Importantly, the open label extension of the trial to six months showed a seizure reduction of at least 50% in more than half of the experimental group, making it a promising candidate for further larger and longer trials. This trial represents an internationally significant, landmark trial, to build an evidence base to support the availability and use of medicinal cannabis based treatments for adults with common forms of epilepsy.” See the paper  O'Brien TJ, Berkovic SF, French JA, Messenheimer JA, Sebree TB, Bonn-Miller MO, Gutterman DL; STAR 1/STAR 2 Study Group.

  Monash researchers are studying the use of cannabis to control epileptic seizures in a leading international clinical trial that could improve the lives of people living with epilepsy. Epilepsy affects around one per cent of the population, and 20 to 30 per cent of epilepsy patients continue to experience seizures despite taking current antiepileptic medications.  Ongoing seizures carry a risk of serious injuries, psycho-social and mental health problems and sudden death. Studying the use of cannabis to control seizures, could bring significant benefits to those patients. Monash Medical Centre is among other Victorian hospitals participating in the large-scale, multicentre study and Associate Professor Udaya Seneviratne said cannabis had long been used for medicinal purposes. “Many centuries ago in China, cannabis was used as a medicinal agent to treat several ailments and in the early 1800s, western medicine started using it as a painkiller. “More recently, there has been a resurgence in interest in the use of cannabis to treat epilepsy, chronic pain, spasticity, and nausea. “Some studies have highlighted dramatic improvement in seizure control with cannabis in patients with uncontrolled epilepsy,” said Associate Professor Seneviratne, who is also Monash Health’s leading epileptologist. Cannabis contains over 80 chemical compounds known as cannabinoids. Cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are the most studied chemicals. “THC has psychoactive properties producing a “high,” a property sought by recreational users, however, CBD has medicinal properties, and unlike THC, does not cause addiction,” Associate Professor Seneviratne said. CBD has potent antiepileptic properties demonstrated in animal studies. Its value as an antiepileptic drug to control seizures has been shown in small studies in humans. Associate Professor Seneviratne said patients with focal epilepsy who still had seizures despite taking standard antiepileptic drugs were being selected to take part in the trial. “At the moment, we do not have sufficient evidence on the efficacy and safety of cannabis to recommend it as an antiepileptic agent to treat epilepsy. “Both the medical community and patients are eagerly waiting for the results of this trial—it will be an important milestone in establishing the place of CBD as an antiepileptic drug, bringing hope to those living with epilepsy” he said. In Victoria, Monash Medical Centre, Austin Hospital, Royal Melbourne Hospital and St. Vincent’s Hospital are involved in the clinical trial.","Oct 6, 2016 ...

 Legalising the sale of cannabis for recreational use can lead to a short-term increase in traffic fatalities in legalising states and their neighbouring jurisdictions, new research suggests. The researchers looked at the number of additional deaths each month after legalisation, and found there was on average one additional traffic fatality per million residents, in comparison to states that had not changed cannabis laws. The increase tended to remain elevated over one year before plateauing. The combined population of affected areas is 27 million people, suggesting an additional 170 deaths in the first six months after legalisation. But the study reported the spill over effects to be slightly larger in neighbouring states and provinces, particularly those with population centres closest to the border of a legalising state – possibly because cannabis users were driving interstate to make purchases, before returning under the influence. It’s called ‘cannabis tourism’, and Monash University’s Dr Tyler Lane says there are important implications for both legalising states and their neighbours as prohibitions against cannabis use are lifted globally. “The effect of cannabis legalisation on traffic fatalities is a growing public health concern,” Dr Lane said. “The results suggest that legalising the sale of cannabis for recreational use can lead to a temporary increase in traffic fatalities in legalising states. This spills over into neighbouring jurisdictions through cross-border sales, trafficking, or cannabis tourists driving back to their state of residence while impaired. “Our findings suggest that policymakers should consult with neighbouring jurisdictions when liberalising cannabis policy to mitigate any deleterious effects.” Dr Lane said the findings were in contrast to research on medicinal cannabis suggesting it decreases traffic fatalities. One reason for the difference may be that medicinal users tend to substitute cannabis for other substances, including alcohol, which has a greater effect on impairment. Recreational users are less likely to substitute and more likely to combine alcohol and cannabis, which has a much bigger effect than either in isolation.

Abstract:  
Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in Australia and is used by a wide section 
of the community, particularly younger people. Contrary to data from the early to mid -
1990s, recent Victorian cr ash data suggest that the use of cannabis is associated with 
elevated culpability in crashes. It is therefore timely to draw together the international 
literature in regard to the issues around cannabis use and road safety. This report reviews 
the key issu es concerning cannabis and road safety, including: patterns of cannabis use; the 
prevalence of cannabis in the driver population, drivers suspected of driving under the 
influence, and drivers killed or injured; effects on simulator and on -road driving; det ection 
of cannabis in bodily samples; and measurement of impairment using performance tests 
such as the Standardised Field Sobriety Test. The report highlights the current gaps in

  x MONASH UNIVERSITY ACCIDENT RESEARCH CENTRE    CANNABIS AND ROAD SA FETY : A REVIEW OF RECENT L ITERATURE   xi EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
Cannabis is the most commonly used i llicit drug in Australia and is used by a wide section 
of the community. The 2001 National Drug Strategy Household Survey reported that 33% 
of Australians over 14 years of age had used cannabis at least once, while 13% had used 
cannabis recently. While the re is much evidence demonstrating that cannabis impairs many 
aspects of human performance, research is continuing to examine the means by which this 
impairment manifests in the driving environment. This report reviews the epidemiological, 
driver performanc e, and drug screening literature as it relates to cannabis and road safety.  
The recent epidemiological studies reviewed show that cannabinoids are present in a 
significant proportion of drivers killed and injured in road accidents. Recent data for fatally 
injured drivers in Australia between 1997 and 1999 show that 8.5% of tested drivers were 
positive for the psychoactive component of cannabis, delta -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). 
Drivers positive for THC were significantly more culpable than drug free drive rs, with 
culpability increasing further when THC was combined with alcohol.  
Case -control studies offer the greatest potential for demonstrating an increased risk of 
injury associated with drug use, whereby the presence of drugs in injured drivers is 
compar ed to the prevalence in a control sample of non -accident involved drivers. While 
some recent studies of this nature have been published, methodological issues, such as the 
selection of appropriate treatment and control groups, and sample size, reinforce th e need 
for further epidemiological studies of this type.  
There have been numerous studies published in recent decades that have aimed to examine 
the effects of cannabis on both simulated and on -road driving. Recent on -road and 
simulator studies have set th e benchmark for cannabis and driving research. There is no 
doubt that recent research is continuing to show that cannabis, both alone and with alcohol, 
impairs a range of measures of driving performance. The predominant form of impairment 
observed after sm oking cannabis alone is an increase in lane weaving behaviour. This 
measure of behaviour is also sensitive to impairment associated with fatigue and alcohol 
consumption. The use of cannabis alone has also been associated with increased variability 
in headw ay to a lead vehicle. This is an important finding because it is commonly 
interpreted as reflecting the ability to perceive changes in the relative velocities of other 
vehicles and ability to adjust own speed accordingly, and is suggestive of impaired 
perceptual abilities. Cannabis has also been found to lead to increased reaction time to 
respond in an emergency decision -making task.  
While cannabis has been found to have a number of negative effects on driving 
performance, it has been suggested that people experiencing the effects of cannabis appear 
to be aware of their impairment and where possible they compensate by, for example, 
slowing down, focussing attention and not taking risks (like overtaking). However, drivers 
are not completely able to compensate  for the number of adverse effects on driving 
behaviour. These alleged compensatory effects come at a cost to the driver, in that 
increased ratings of perceived effort after smoking cannabis, perhaps by focussing 
attention, would lead to a reduction in spa re capacity. Safety would be compromised, 
particularly in situations when the driver encounters unexpected events, and/or when the 
driver is placed in situations requiring increased mental load or continuous attention.  
When cannabis is combined with alcoho l, variability of headway is again increased, and 
variability in lane weaving behaviour is increased to a greater extent than for cannabis 
alone. This is again indicative of impaired performance. Furthermore, drivers with both  xii MONASH UNIVERSITY ACCIDENT RESEARCH CENTRE  cannabis and alcohol take sig nificantly longer to react to changes in the speed of other 
vehicles, which is suggestive of a decrease in safety. To illustrate, the combination of a 
moderate dose of alcohol and cannabis is found to produce impairment to a level observed 
at a Blood Alcoh ol Concentration of around 0.14%. Furthermore, the frequency of visual 
search for traffic at intersections has been found to be similar for placebo, alcohol alone, 
and cannabis alone, but reduced significantly when alcohol & cannabis are combined. In 
accor dance with some previous research, this finding suggests that drivers are less able to 
respond to peripheral traffic while maintaining performance on the central driving task.  
One of the clear messages to emerge from the research reviewed is that there is a need to 
examine the effects of cannabis in situations where the driver is required to perform several 
tasks simultaneously or when confronted with a situation that requires a rapid adaptive 
response. Furthermore, there has been little research examining the effects of cannabis, 
alone and in combination with alcohol and other drugs, across a range of levels of driving 
experience.  
Literature addressing the detection of drug -impaired drivers is also briefly reviewed. 
Broadly speaking there are two approaches  that are being researched and used world -wide 
to detect drug use, including cannabis use, at the roadside. The first, and the one that is 
most actively being researched, is the ability to screen for drugs of abuse in bodily 
samples. The major samples unde r investigation are blood, urine, sweat, and saliva. Blood 
sampling represents the most accurate means for conducting drug analyses, however, it is 
not a practical means of testing for drug use in the field. While much research is being 
directed towards re searching alternative samples, the majority of effort is being directed 
towards the development of a saliva -based measure of drug use. Saliva has been identified 
as the preferred specimen by police forces and experts across the European Union. The 
second a pproach is to determine drug -related impairment by measuring performance on 
standardised tests. Both approaches are being used for law enforcement purposes in 
Victoria.  
  CANNABIS AND ROAD SAF ETY : A REVIEW OF RECENT L ITERATURE   1 1. INTRODUCTION  
Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in Australia and is use d by a wide section 
of the community. The most recent National Drug Strategy Household Survey in 2001 was 
the largest of a series of such surveys conducted since 1985 with a total sample of 27,000 
Australians aged 14 years and over (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2001) . The 
survey generates information about curr ent drug consumption patterns, community 
attitudes toward drugs and drug enforcement, and drug related behaviours and activities.  
The 2001 National Drug Strategy Household Survey findings suggest that 33% of 
Australians over 14 years of age have used cann abis at least once in their lifetime, while 
13% have used the drug in the 12 months prior to the survey (recent use). The proportions 
were higher for the younger males, with 61% of males aged 20 -29 years reporting lifetime 
cannabis use (56% for females), a nd 35% reporting recent use (compared to 23% for 
females).  
1.2 BASIC PHARMACOLOGY  
Cannabis preparations are largely drawn from the plant of Cannabis sativa (Hall & 
Solowij, 1998) , of which the major psychoactive component is delta -9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (Adams & Martin, 1996) . Cannabis preparations are typically 
generated from flowering tops and leaves resulting in a  THC content between 0.5 -5.0%, 
and is prepared from the dried. Hashish has a THC content between 2 -20% and consists of 
dried cannabis resin and compressed flowers (Hall & Solowij, 1998) . Cannabis is usually 
smoked in a ‘joint’, approximately the size of a cigarette. Smokers inhale deeply to 
maximise the absorption of THC into the lungs. Whil e cannabis can be eaten, smoking is 
the most common form of use because it is the easiest way to achieve the desired drug 
effects (Hall, Solowij, & Lemon, 1994) .  
Before discussing the effects of cannabis on performance and mo od, it is important to gain 
an understanding of the pharmacokinetics of cannabis. Ashton (1999) suggests that 
approximately 50% of the THC and other cannabinoids present in a cannabis cigarette 
enter the mainstream smoke and are inhaled, while Adams and Ma rtin (1996) suggest that 
as little as 10 to 25% of available THC may enter the circulation when smoked. Subjective 
and objective effects are discernible within seconds, and fully apparent within minutes, 
from the start of smoking. Lower doses of cannabis ( i.e., 2.5 mg THC) is enough to 
produce measurable psychological and physical effects in occasional cannabis users 
(Ashton, 1999) . 
On entering th e bloodstream, cannabinoids are distributed rapidly throughout the body, 
reaching first the tissues with the highest blood flow (brain, lungs, liver, etc.). 
Cannabinoids are highly fat soluble, and accumulate in fatty tissues from which they are 
very slowl y released back into other body compartments, including the brain (Adams & 
Martin, 1996). The plasma elimination half -life of THC is approximately 56  hours in 
occasional users and 28  hours in chronic users. However, the tissue half -life is 
approximately 7 days and complete elimination of a single dose may take up to 30  days 
(Ashton, 1999) . If cannabis is taken orally, the  amount of cannabinoids a bsorbed is 
25-30% of that obtained by smoking and the onset of effects is 0.5 -2 hours, although 
duration of action may be prolonged.  
The primary psychoactive constituent of cannabis, THC, is metabolised to an active 
metabolite, 11 -hydroxy -delta -9-tetrahydr ocannabinol (11 -OH-THC), which in turn is  2 MONASH UNIVERSITY ACCIDENT RESEARCH CENTRE  rapidly converted to an inactive metabolite, 11 -nor-9-carboxy -delta -tetrahydocannabinol 
(THC -COOH). In a study of the pharmacokinetic profile of the absorption of THC, Huestis 
et al. (1992a)  showed that THC levels increas ed rapidly following the smoking of one 
marijuana cigarette (1.75%, 3.55% THC) and peaked prior to the end of smoking. Peak 11 -
OH-THC levels occurred immediately after the end of smoking and THCCOOH levels 
increased slowly and plateaued for an extended per iod. 
High levels of THC are detectable in saliva immediately after smoking, followed by a 
rapid decline in the first hour (Cone, 1993; Menkes, Howard, Spears, & Cairns, 1991) . 
Cannabis is detectable in saliva for at least four hours post smoking, although this will be 
dose-dependent (Maseda e t al., 1986) . The limited evidence with regard to the relationship 
between saliva THC and the time course of effects of cannabis is equivocal (Cone, 1993) . 
Establishing such a relationship may be challenging as it is clear that THC levels in saliva 
may result in part from the contamination of the oral cavity during the smoking process 
(Gross et al., 1985; Kidwell et al., 1998).  
Having briefly addressed the pharmacokinetics of cannabis, discussions in the following 
sections will provide an short overview of the effects of cannabis on mood, performance in 
general, and driving. After considering the effects of cannabis on driving, the next issue 
considered is how to detect cannabis -related impairment on the road. The final section of 
this report discusses the available pharmacological and performance -based measures for 
defining drug -related impairment.   CANNABIS AND ROAD SAF ETY : A REVIEW OF RECENT L ITERATURE   3 2. THE EFFECTS OF CANNA BIS ON PER FORMANCE AND 
MOOD  
While the effects of cannabis on driving are the focus of this review, it is instructive to 
briefly consider the effects of cannabis on wider aspects of performance and mood.  
2.1 EFFECTS OF CANNABIS ON MOOD  
The ability of cannabis to produce  a 'high', is no doubt an important single action that 
sustains its widespread use. The euphoric effect varies greatly with dose, mode of 
administration, expectation, environment and personality of the user. When small doses are 
taken in social gatherings,  the main effects are a pleasant euphoria, very similar to those of 
social doses of alcohol (Ashton, 1999) . A high can be induced by doses as sm all as 2.5 mg 
THC in a cigarette and includes feelings of intoxication and detachment, with decreased 
anxiety, alertness, depression and tension, in addition to perceptual changes. The intensity 
of the high is dose -dependent, being increased with higher do ses. 
In naïve cannabis users, dysphoric reactions to cannabis are not uncommon. Such reactions 
may include severe anxiety and panic, unpleasant somatic sensations and paranoid feelings 
(Thomas, 1993) . Anxiety -panic reactions are the most common adverse psychological 
effects of cannabis use. They may include restlessness, depersonalisation, and a sense of 
loss of control and fear of dying. In some subjects eu phoria and dysphoria, laughing and 
crying, may alternate. After an initial period of excitement following an acute dose, 
cannabis exerts a central nervous system depressant effect which leads to drowsiness and 
sleep towards the end of a period of intoxicat ion (Ashton, 1999) . 
2.2 EFFECT OF CANNAB IS ON PERFORMANCE  
Perceptual changes induced by cannabis affect all sensory modalities. Temporal and spa tial 
perception is distorted so that judgement of distance and time are impaired. Experimental 
studies of time perception have found that subjects consistently overestimate the passage of 
time even after small doses (e.g. four puffs of a cigarette containi ng 3.6% THC) (Chait & 
Perry, 1994; Dougherty, Cherek, & Roache, 1994) . The effects of cannabis on thought 
processes are characterised initially by a feeling of increased speed of thought. With higher 
doses  of cannabis, thoughts may become out of control, fragmented, and lead to mental 
confusion (Ashton, 1999) . 
The effect of cannabis on memory proc esses is the single most consistently reported 
cognitive deficit following the use of cannabis. Cannabis causes a specific deficit in 
short -term memory, an effect which is apparent even after small doses in experienced 
cannabis users. Memory impairment ind uced by cannabis has been investigated in a large 
variety of tests, including immediate free recall of digits, prose material and word -picture 
combinations (see Robbe, 1994, Adams & Martin, 1986, for  reviews) . The deficit appears 
to be in the acquisition of memory and may result fr om an attentional deficit combined 
with an inability to filter out irrelevant information and the intrusion of extraneous 
thoughts. Memory lapses may account in part for the time distortion and may contribute to 
poor psychomotor performance in complex task s (Ashton, 1999) . 
The effects of cannabis on perception, memory and cognition, motor co -ordination and 
general arousal level combine to affect v arious types of psychomotor performance (see 
Robbe, 1994 , for a review). Laboratory investigations show that social doses of cannabis  4 MONASH UNIVERSITY ACCIDENT RESEARCH CENTRE  have minimal effects on performance in simple motor tasks and simple reaction times. 
However, even small doses (THC 5 -15 mg) can cause significant im pairment of 
performance in complex or demanding tasks, such as those involving fine hand -eye 
co-ordination, complex tracking, divided attention tasks, visual information processing, 
digit code tests, alternate addition -subtraction tasks and many others. Pe rformance in all of 
these tasks deteriorates as the dose increases, and can last for two hours or more after a 
single dose (Ashton, 1999) .  
Whil e the effects of cannabis on driving skills will be addressed shortly, the effects of 
cannabis on other complex real -life situations has been investigated. Like driving, piloting 
an aeroplane is a complex task, and so it is perhaps not surprising that cann abis has been 
shown to impair the skills of pilots. In double -blind, placebo -controlled studies, gross 
decrements in performance on flight simulator tasks were found in 10 trainee pilots after 
smoking cannabis (2.1% THC) (Janowsky, Meacham, Blaine, Schoor, & Bozzetti, 1976a, 
1976b) . Performance deficits included increased errors, altitude de viations, poor alignment 
on landing, difficulties in remembering the flight sequence, and time distortion. Significant 
impairments were noted for more than 24 hours after a single dose of cannabis. Another 
study examined the effects of cannabis (THC 0, 10 and 20 mg) with two levels of difficulty 
(calm and turbulent simulated flying) in nine old (aged 30 -48 years) and nine young (aged 
18-29 years) pilots (Leirer, Yesavage, & Morrow, 1989) . It was found that older pilots 
made more mistakes tha n younger pilots, and that the effect of cannabis dose, age, and task 
difficulty were cumulative. At least one aircraft crash in which the pilot was known to have 
taken cannabis some hours before flying has been reported (Leirer, Yesavage, & Morrow, 
1991) . The error was a result of a landing misalignment similar to those observed in 
experimental studies.  
2.2.1  The relationship between plasma THC levels and subsequen t performance and 
mood  
Numerous studies, using a variety of administration procedures including smoking, 
intravenous and oral routes of administration, have examined the relationship between 
plasma THC levels and the time course of subjective, physiologica l and performance 
effects of cannabis. While there are some exceptions, the findings of these studies suggest 
that changes in blood concentration of THC is out of phase with the subjective, 
physiological and behavioural effects of cannabis (Cone & Huestis, 1993; Kelly, Foltin, 
Emurian, & Fischman, 1993; Ohls son et al., 1980) . It appears that there is a lag between 
peak plasma THC levels and peak subjective effects and performance decrements. The 
failure to observe a direct relationship between plasma THC levels and the effects of 
cannabis has been attributed  to the psychoactive effects of the metabolites and/or the 
persistence of THC in the CNS (Reeve, Grant, Robertso n, Gillespie, & Hollister, 1983) . 
According to this explanation, the subjective, physiological and behavioural effects of 
cannabis are the result of direct effects of both THC and the metabolite 11 -hydroxy -delta -
9-tetrahydrocannabinol. The absence of a st rong and consistent time -course relationship 
between plasma THC concentration and performance has important implications for drug 
detection and the establishing of drug -related impairment.  
One important finding is that subjective and physiological effects occur at much lower 
plasma concentrations following oral administration than are observed following 
intravenous administration or the smoking of cannabis cigarettes (Ohlsson et al., 1980) . 
While it is clear that blood THC levels cannot be used to predict the time course or 
magnitude of the effects of the drug, it appears that they can be used to predict  the timing  CANNABIS AND ROAD SAF ETY : A REVIEW OF RECENT L ITERATURE   5 of cannabis use. Mathematical models have been successfully developed for the prediction 
of elapsed time since cannabis use on the basis of an analysis of plasma concentrations of 
THC and THC -COOH (Cone & Huestis, 1993; Huestis, Henningfield, & Cone, 1992b) .   6 MONASH UNIVERSITY ACCIDENT RESEARCH CENTRE    CANNABIS AND ROAD SAF ETY : A REVIEW OF RECENT L ITERATURE   7 3. CANNABIS AND DRIVING   
Cannabis use in the driving population and the role of cannabis i n accident causation have 
been examined through epidemiological studies of the prevalence of cannabis metabolites 
in blood samples of both fatally and non -fatally injured drivers. The effects of cannabis on 
driving skills have been examined in studies of d river performance after the ingestion of 
the drug. The discussion here will begin with a consideration of the epidemiological 
evidence from Australia and overseas, with comment on the culpability studies that have 
been conducted in Australia. The effects o f cannabis on simulated driving and on -road 
driving performance are then discussed.  
A recent MUARC report has presented recent drug driving data for both the general 
population and drug users (Haworth, Clark, & Lenné, 2004). The following section on 
drug u se surveys is drawn heavily from that report.  
3.1 DRUG USE SURVEYS  
3.1.1  Estimates of drug driving from general population surveys  
Two surveys have recently collected information about drug driving as part of general 
population surveys of Australians: The National Drug Strategy Household Survey and the 
AAMI Young Driver Index.  
National Drug Strategy Household Survey  
In addition to asking about patterns of drug use, the National Drug Strategy Household 
Survey also asks respondents if they had driven a vehicl e under the influence of illegal 
drugs in the previous 12 months. Overall, 3.9% of the sample had driven under the 
influence of illicit drugs. Driving was the activity most likely to be undertaken whilst 
under the influence of illicit drugs. Females were l ess than half as likely (2.2%) to drive 
under the influence of drugs than males (5.7%). It is important to note here that the type of 
drug used is not specified.  
AAMI Young Driver Index  
In December 2002, AAMI Insurance published their second annual Young Driver Index. 
The findings were based on the company’s insurance claims and a survey of 1,184 licensed 
drivers of all ages living in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, 
South Australia, Tasmania and Queensland. Overall, 15% of driv ers aged 18 -24 reported 
driving after using recreational drugs. Young women were more likely to report having 
driven after using recreational drugs than to report having driven under the influence of 
alcohol. Eight percent of young drivers (higher among ma les) and five per cent of older 
drivers thought that using a small amount of recreational drugs before driving did not 
affect their driving ability. Young drivers were more likely than older drivers to consider 
that driving after using recreational drugs w as safer than driving after drinking (15% 
versus 7%). Support for random drug testing was high among young drivers (84%) but 
lower than among older drivers (89%). Again however, the type of drug is not specified.  
3.1.2  Estimates of drug driving in drug use r populations  
A number of studies have interviewed drug users about their drug driving behaviour. 
Lenné, Fry, Dietze and Rumbold (2001), examined the drug driving behaviour patterns of  8 MONASH UNIVERSITY ACCIDENT RESEARCH CENTRE  cannabis users and their attitudes to the (then) proposed introduction of driver impairment 
testing in Victoria. Their research found a common belief amongst participants that 
cannabis did not affect their driving ability or increase their accident risk. Over half of the 
participants said that driving under the influence of c annabis should be legal, were 
confident that they would not be detected if driving under the influence of cannabis and 
had no intention of ceasing their drug driving behaviour due to legislative changes. One of 
the major reasons provided, regarding their c onfidence in avoiding detection, was a belief 
that the testing procedures were not sensitive enough to detect their cannabis use. 
However, the majority of participants did acknowledge that the combination of cannabis 
and alcohol was detrimental to driving.  This was reflected in their driving behaviour, with 
participants driving only 14% of the time after a combination of cannabis and alcohol use, 
compared to driving 43% of the time after using cannabis alone.  
Due to the sampling criteria, inferences from t his research cannot be made to the general 
population. However, specific findings from this population can provide insights into an 
area that has little empirical data available. Through exposure to educational information, 
the drivers in this sample do re cognise the correlation between alcohol consumption and 
driving impairment. They also refrain from driving under the influence of alcohol to avoid 
being detected. These findings suggest that the introduction of the Road Safety (Drug 
Driving) Act 2003 Testi ng Program may successfully deter drug driving in 2 ways. Firstly, 
via exposure to the public health messages associated with the introduction of Testing 
Program, regarding the detrimental effects of driving under the influence of cannabis and, 
secondly, t hat the testing procedures are now sensitive enough to detect their cannabis 
consumption.  
Darke, Kelly and Ross (2004) reported a Sydney study that examined drug driving and 
related motor vehicle accidents among intravenous drugs users. The sample consist ed of 
300 regular intravenous drug users recruited via advertising from the inner, middle and 
outer geographical regions of Sydney. Information was obtained from participants 
regarding their drug taking history, drug use locations, psychological functionin g and drug 
driving behaviours.  
Of the participants who currently drive, 87% reported driving a motor vehicle soon after 
using drugs within the last 12 months. The drug most commonly involved in drug driving 
was cannabis (74% ever, 57% during last 12 months ). Of the sample, 32% reported having 
been involved in a motor vehicle accident while drug driving. Heroin was reported as the 
drug used in accident involvement (53%), followed by cannabis (46%), and then alcohol 
(42%).  
Of the participants, 89% had been a  passenger with a drug driver, with 17% being involved 
in an accident in the last 12 months. Cars were the most common venue for drug taking 
amongst drug drivers. The report concludes that drug drivers in this sample were most 
likely to be poly -drug users,  who use drugs in their cars and regularly drive while under the 
influence.  
In summary, drug use and drug driving are, not surprisingly, much more common amongst 
drug user populations. Even among injecting drug users, cannabis remains the drug most 
likely  to be involved in drug driving. Clearly there is a need to conduct further research to 
establish the drug use and driving behaviours in the wider community.   CANNABIS AND ROAD SAF ETY : A REVIEW OF RECENT L ITERATURE   9 3.2 EPIDEMIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE  
There have been a number of published papers that have reviewed the p revalence of drugs 
in both the general and crash populations of drivers. The reader is directed to other sources 
for further information (e.g., Bates & Blakely, 1999; Macdonald et al., 2003) . 
 
In order to gain a clear understanding of the extent to which drivers around the world are 
driving while impaired b y drugs, it is critical that substantial data be collected on the 
prevalence of drug use in the general driving population (i.e., non -accident involved 
drivers). While such imposing epidemiological studies are yet to be conducted, some data 
have been colle cted from roadside surveys that provide some insight into the extent of 
drug-impaired driving worldwide. Roadside surveys conducted in Germany and the 
Netherlands suggest that the prevalence of drugs in drivers sampled is as follows: alcohol 
(6-12%), canna bis (1 -5%), amphetamines (0.8 -1.4%), opiates (0.7 -1.4%), and 
benzodiazepines (0.3 -2.6%) (Maes, Charlier, Grenez, & Verstraete, 1999) . 
A recent random sample of 1000 drivers in rural Denmark yielded 896 sa mples and 636 
returned questionnaires. The study found that only 1.3% of saliva samples subjected to 
laboratory analysis were positive for illegal drugs, and 0.7% for benzodiazepines 
(Behrensdorff & Steentoft, 2003) . In this study THC was detected in 21 saliva samples and 
in only 7 confirmatory tests. Thirty -eight responde nts (5.8%) to the survey indicated 
having used medicinal or illegal drugs in the preceding 24 hours, but only 1 driver 
admitted to using cannabis during this time. High proportions of the sample supported 
police enforcement of drugged driving penalties for  participants who both did and did not 
report driving after using drugs in the preceding 24 hours (85 and 935 respectively).  
The incidence of alcohol and drugs increases when data from drivers suspected of drugged 
driving are considered. Table 1 below show s European data on the prevalence of drugs in 
drivers suspected by police of driving under the influence of alcohol or others drugs. 
Alcohol is clearly the most common drug found in these studies, followed by 
benzodiazepines, cannabis, and amphetamines. Th e data shown in Table 1 are drawn

As shown in Table 2, data have also been collected on the prevalence of drugs in 
(European) drivers who were injured or killed in road crashes. The pattern in these studies 
is similar to that shown in Table 1 with the most prevalent drug being by far alcohol, again 
followed by benzodiazepines, cannabis, am phetamines, and opiates (Alvarez et al., 1997; 
Christophersen et al., 1995) .  
While the prevalence data detailed in Tables 1 and 2 vary markedly between countries, it is 
not possible to directly com pare between studies because of the different methodologies 
used in each study (driver group, time and location of sampling, potential differences in 
police procedures, etc). However, these observational studies say little in the absence of 
knowing the pop ulation prevalence.  While the prevalence of drug driving appears low, the 
rate at which these drugs appear in Tables 1 and 2 is higher suggesting increased crash 
risk. This is followed up in the next section.   CANNABIS AND ROAD SAF ETY : A REVIEW OF RECENT L ITERATURE   11 Table 2: Drug prevalence in drivers injured or  killed in Norway and Spain (adapted

Data have been collected on the prevalence of drugs in injured drivers in Australia, and are 
discussed in the following section in the context of the culpability studies.  
3.2.1  Culpability studies  
Some studies ha ve moved beyond stating the mere prevalence of different types of drugs in 
bodily samples taken from fatally or seriously injured drivers by using methods for 
assigning culpability or responsibility for each accident. As shown in Table 2, 
epidemiological s tudies suggest that cannabinoids are present in a significant proportion of 
drivers killed in road accidents. In the first of a series of studies, Drummer (1994)  collected 
data for 1045 drivers killed. Culpability was determined according to the mitigating factors 
(independent of drug analysis), and drivers were classified as culpable, contributory, or not 
culpable. The miti gating factors used in the analyses were the condition of the road and 
vehicle, driving conditions, type of accident, witness observations, road law obedience, 
difficulty of the task involved, the level of fatigue (Robertson & Drummer, 1994) . The 
proportion of culpable drivers (ratio) was calculated for each drug type condition. The 
large majority (73%) of drivers in the sample as a whole were culpable, while 1 8% were 
not culpable. The relative risks for each drug type are presented below in Table 3.   12 MONASH UNIVERSITY ACCIDENT RESEARCH CENTRE  Table 3: Responsibility analysis for fatal accidents (Drummer, 1994) .

The first column in Table 3 shows the prevalence of each drug type in fatal crashes found 
by Drummer (1994). As w ith the European data, alcohol was the most prevalent drug 
found in these drivers. The increase in risk (or culpability) associated with each drug type 
(alone and in combination with alcohol) is shown relative to the drug free drivers. The 
highest culpabil ity ratio for any drug alone was found for alcohol, then opiates. Culpability 
ratios were considerably higher for all drugs in combination with alcohol, except opiates. It 
is interesting to note the ratio for cannabis alone. The analyses for cannabis inclu ded THC 
and the inactive metabolite, THC -COOH, which makes interpretation difficult and 
suggests that this ratio may not be truly representative of the culpability ratio associated 
with impairments from THC alone.  
A more recent analysis examined the preva lence of drugs in 3398 fatally injured drivers 
across Victoria, New South Wales, and Western Australia between 1990 and 1999 
(Drummer et al., 2003) . Due to developments in analytical techniques, Drummer and 
colleagues were able to determine level of THC as distinct from the longer lasting inactive 
metabolite only fo r the latter part of their sample. Between 1997 and 1999, 221 cases 
(15.6%) were positive for cannabinoids while 121 (8.5%) were positive for THC (the 
confirmation rate was 52%, which means that THC was detected in just over half of the 
sample of drivers f or whom cannabinoids were detected). Of the THC positive cases, 58 
were positive for THC alone, 43 positive for THC and alcohol, and 20 positive for THC 
and other drugs.  
Drummer et al.’s (2003) data were then subjected to culpability analyses in a subseque nt 
publication, and Odds Ratios (ORs) were calculated for various drug combinations 
(Drummer et al., 2004) . Similar to the earlier work, t hese ORs were the ratio of culpability 
for those exposed to those unexposed to drug use. The presence of THC was associated 
with increased culpability for both car drivers (OR 2.7, CI 1.02 -7.0) and motorcyclists (OR 
2.4, CI 0.5 -12.5). Of those drivers positive for THC only (n=58), the majority (84%) had 
THC levels > 5 ng/ml. Taking only these levels, THC was significantly associated with 
increased culpability (OR 6.6, CI 1.5 -28), which is similar to the OR associated with BAC -
positive cases over 0.15%. Drivers posit ive for THC and who had a BAC over 0.05% were 
2.9 times more likely to be culpable than drivers who were BAC positive only, which 
suggests that THC does enhance impairment associated with alcohol. These data are for 
THC positive cases only.  
  CANNABIS AND ROAD SAF ETY : A REVIEW OF RECENT L ITERATURE   13  
It should be  noted that the following factors were incorporated into the logistic regression 
model: gender; age; BAC level; type of drug; type of crash (single versus multi vehicle), 
State of Crash; and Year of Crash. The age -gender, age -BAC, and age -drug group 
intera ctions (amongst others) were not significant. Culpability was higher for 18 -25 year 
olds than 30 -39 and 40 -59 year olds, and higher for drivers with a drug than controls. Time 
of day however was not incorporated into the model.  
 
Data have also been reporte d on the prevalence rates for various drugs in non -fatal 
accidents in Australia. Longo and colleagues collected blood samples from 2500 non -
fatally injured drivers in South Australia in 1995 -1996 (Longo, Hunter, Lokan, White, & 
White, 2000a, 2000b) . Alcohol was the most prevalent drug in these samples, being 
present in 8.6% of cases. The next most prevalent drugs were cannabis (THC) only (7.1%), 
cannabis and alcohol (3.0%), benzodiazepines only (1.8%), and stimulants only (0.8%). 
Just over 75% of drivers tested were negative for alcohol and other drugs. Alcohol and 
cannabis were more prevalent in single vehicle accidents than mu ltiple vehicle accidents. 
Culpability analyses were conducted and the results appear below (Table 4). Over half 
(59%) of those cases positive for THC had levels <2 ng/ml, and there was no relationship 
between culpability and level of THC for these cases. I t should be noted that the 
concentrations of THC were quite low, which contrasts starkly with the THC levels 
reported by Drummer et al (2004) where most samples (84%) were above 5 ng/ml.  
The trend continues in that alcohol was the most dangerous drug in te rms of the percentage 
of drivers found culpable with one drug alone. Culpability was again much higher for 
drugs in combination with alcohol, particularly cannabis and benzodiazepines.

Culpability analyses certainly provide valuable information concerning the role of drugs in 
injury crashes. However, wh ile culpable cases may be positive for a drug, this does not 
represent conclusive evidence for a causal relationship because these studies only examine 
crash -involved drivers. So, while culpability analyses indicate that, for example, cannabis 
is associate d with higher culpability, further research is needed to examine the link 
between the presence of cannabis in the blood and subsequent impairment.  
 
Other types of observational  studies offer the greatest potential for demonstrating any 
changed risk of inj ury associated with drug use. One such design involves the use of the 
case-control design, whereby drug exposures measured through samples taken from  14 MONASH UNIVERSITY ACCIDENT RESEARCH CENTRE  injured drivers (cases) is compared to drug exposures in samples collected from drivers 
who have not been involved in crashes (controls) (see  Bates & Blakely, 1999 , for a 
discussion on the method ologies in this context). A recent case -control study in the 
Netherlands attempted to implement this study design by sampling 110 motorists admitted 
to a hospital emergency room (cases) and 1029 randomly selected drivers from moving 
traffic (controls) (Movig et al., 2004) . Control drivers were asked to participate in the study 
on a voluntary basis. After consenting participants were asked some questions about their 
drug use, and to provide a urine sample for analysis (a blood sample was taken if a urine 
sample could or would not be provided). Forty percent of cases were positive for one or 
more drugs compared to 14% for controls. While increased odds ratios were foun d for the 
use of benzodiazepines and alcohol, there was not a significant increase in risk associated 
with the use of cannabis.  
 
Movig et al. 2004 discuss two major potential confounding factors in their study. Firstly, 
participation in the control group was high (79%), but voluntary, hence it is possible that 
those drivers with a drug(s) other than alcohol in their system may have refused to 
participate. Although Movig et al. (2004)  suggest no differences in the demographics for 
those control drivers who did and did not participate, this potential confound remains. 
Secondly, drivers in the control sample were asked firstly to provide a urine sample,  and 
blood samples were only taken when a urine sample either could or would not be provided. 
While those authors state that there are advantages in urine sampling (e.g., the longer 
presence of drugs in samples and in higher concentrations compared to bloo d), such 
sampling is problematic in the case of cannabis because presence in the urine is by no 
means associated with impairment (see later sections of this report). While the authors state 
that 6.3% of urine and 7.3% of blood samples were positive for can nabis, the potential for 
an underestimation of the risks of cannabis use remain.  
 
While there are some concerns from the conclusions about the risks associated with 
cannabis use derived from this study, it has reinforced, with a case -controlled design, the  
significantly elevated risks associated with driving under the influence of multiple drugs 
and alcohol -drug combinations.  
 
In a larger case -control study of different design to Movig et al., Mura and colleagues 
compared drug exposures between 900 injured drivers (cases) and 900 non -driver controls 
(Mura et al.,  2003) . Car drivers were recruited from six hospital emergency departments in 
France after admission resulting from non -fatal accidents. Controls were patients attending 
these emergency departments, who had a driver’s licence, but were admitted for any no n-
traumatic reason (matched for age and gender). Cannabis (THC) was measured from blood 
samples, with the mean time between the crash and sample collection being 1.8 hrs. Higher 
proportions of the drivers aged 18 -22 and 23 -26 years had THC detected (> 1 ng /ml) 
compared to controls. Across all age groups 10% of drivers and 5% of controls were 
positive for THC. The prevalence of cannabis was higher in the drivers compared to 
controls for both those drivers with THC < 2 ng/ml (OR 2.5) and > 2 ng/ml (OR 2.7). T he 
only conclusions that can be drawn from this study are that more young people are 
involved in crashes, and that cannabis is present in a higher proportion of cases than 
controls. The age result could, however, be biased by the time of day.  
3.2.2  Summary  
The studies reviewed here clearly show that alcohol is still a major drug of concern for 
road safety. It is the most commonly detected drug in roadside and injured driver samples, 
and it is associated with a very high degree of accident culpability. The c ombination of  CANNABIS AND ROAD SAF ETY : A REVIEW OF RECENT L ITERATURE   15 other drugs, particularly cannabis and benzodiazepines, with alcohol is also of great 
concern and associated with high culpability.  
It is interesting to note that after reviewing all of the available experimental and 
epidemiological evidence,  Tunbridge et al. (2000)  classified alcohol and benzodiazepines 
as the two drugs that should be  regarded as being the highest priority in terms of the nature 
of their impairing effects and the frequency of their incidence in the driving population, 
and, thereby, representing the greatest risk to road safety. Amphetamines, cocaine, opiates, 
and canna bis were classified as medium priority.  
It has been suggested that methodological concerns with epidemiological studies, such as 
misclassification of drug use, confounding by treatment duration and concentration, and 
statistical power, may contribute to th e underestimation of crash risk (Ramaekers,  2003) . 
However, recent Australian data suggest that the presence of cannabis in blood 
significantly increases culpability in fatal crashes, and that THC further enhances 
impairment resulting from the use of alcohol .  
As discussed, case -control studies of fer the greatest potential for demonstrating an 
increased risk of injury associated with drug use, whereby the presence of drugs in injured 
drivers is compared to the prevalence in a control sample of non -accident involved drivers. 
While some recent studie s of this nature have been published, methodological issues, such 
as the selection of appropriate treatment and control groups, reinforce the need for further 
epidemiological studies of this type.  
3.3 DRIVER PERFORMAN CE STUDIES  
While much research has sho wn that cannabis impairs performance on simple tasks in the 
laboratory (Berghaus, Scheer, & Schmidt, 1995; Chesher, Bird, Jackson, Perrignon, & 
Starmer, 1990) , there is comparatively little res earch on driving. There have been a number 
of studies examining the effects of cannabis using driving simulators and real -life driving 
situations. Although there are some inconsistencies, in general these studies suggest that 
cannabis does appear to impair  driving performance as measured in these settings. 
However, unlike alcohol, the relationship between this impairment and crash risk is not 
well-understood.  
There have been several reviews of the effects of cannabis on the performance of complex 
tasks, in cluding driving (e.g., Newman, 2004; O'Kane, Tutt, & Bauer, 2002; Ramaekers et 
al., 2004; Robbe, 1994; Smiley, 1986; Victorian Parliamentary Road Safety Committee, 
1996; Ward & Dye, 1999) . The earlier studies will therefore be reviewed brief ly, with 
more attention focussed on the studies conducted after 1990.  
3.3.1  Simulator studies  
Early studies such as those by Rafaelsen and colleagues used driver training simulators to 
examine the effects of 8, 12, and 16 mg of ingested THC (Rafaelsen, Christrup, Bech, & 
Rafaelsen, 1973; Rafaelsen et al., 1973) . The 12 and 16 mg doses significantly increased 
braking time and start time (in response to traffic lights) over  10 minutes of driving, 105 
minutes after cannabis consumption. However, there was no effect on mean speed.  
Moskowitz, Hulbert, & McGlothlin (1976)  tested subjects on a driving simulator with 
filmed (rather tha n computer generated) vision. Four doses of cannabis were used: 0, 50, 
100, and 200 ug THC/kg. Twenty -three subjects completed all four sessions. Cannabis did  16 MONASH UNIVERSITY ACCIDENT RESEARCH CENTRE  not significantly affect car control measures such as speed, steering wheel position, and 
lateral  position across 45 to 70 minutes of driving (approximately 30 minutes after 
cannabis consumption). However, performance on a subsidiary search -and-recognition task 
was significantly impaired. This suggests that some of the ancillary perceptual processes 
necessary for safe driving may be adversely affected by the drug.  
The first reported study that used a fully interactive simulator was conducted by Smiley 
and colleagues (Smiley, Moskowitz, & Ziedman, 1981) . Participants received placebo, 
100, and 200 µg/kg cannabis, and drove for 45 minutes commencing 15 minutes after 
cannabis consumption. Both doses of cannabis increased the standard deviation of lateral 
position (SDLP), and the higher dose also increased speed variability on curves. After 
smoking can nabis participants displayed increased secondary reaction time and, in an 
emergency decision -making task, crashed into the obstacle on the road significantly more 
often after the high dose. While cannabis also increased headway variability, it also 
seemed to induce some caution in that participants increased headways and refused more 
opportunities to overtake. With the exception of SDLP and headway variability, 
impairments were only associated with the high dose of cannabis.  
Stein (1987) examined the effect s of cannabis and alcohol  using a similar simulator to 
Smiley et al (1981) (Stein, 1987) . The doses of THC were the same as in the Smile y et al. 
(1981)  study (i.e., placebo, 100, and 200 µg/kg). Cannabis was combined with placebo 
alcohol and alcohol to the 0.10% BAC level. In addition to basic measures of driving 
performance, Stein and colleagues measured steering gust s and examining how the drivers 
compensated for the gusts. Reactions to anticipated and unexpected obstacles were also 
recorded. Alcohol, alone and in combination with cannabis, did significantly increase the 
number of accidents, while cannabis alone did n ot. Alcohol also increased SDLP, speed 
variability and response time. Cannabis was only associated with a drop in mean speed, 
and an increase in speed variability during the divided attention task. The combination of 
cannabis (high dose only) with alcohol produced significantly more impairment than 
alcohol alone.  
A significant study in the area of cannabis and driving was completed very recently 
(Sexton et al., 2000) . This UK study examined issues such as the effects of cannabis on 
driving, mood, and hazard perception, the link between saliva and blood levels of THC, 
and the link between sobriety test performance and driving simulator performance. For this 
reason it is pe rtinent to discuss the methodology and findings from this study in some 
detail.  
Participants were 15 males with a mean age of 27 years. All smoked cannabis at least once 
a week, all drank alcohol at least once a week, and 46% used other drugs – with ecstas y 
being the most frequently used other drug (72%). The entire sample reported having used 
cannabis in combination with alcohol at some time, and the majority of the sample (73%) 
reported using cannabis in combination with alcohol at least once per week.  
Four doses of cannabis were used in this study, and they were:  
1. Placebo: 0.005% ± 0.002 of THC  
2. Low dose: 1.70% ± 0.14 THC  
3. High dose: 2.67% ± 0.04 THC  
4. Cannabis resin (about 1.7% THC)   CANNABIS AND ROAD SAF ETY : A REVIEW OF RECENT L ITERATURE   17 Blood, urine, and saliva samples were taken upon arrival, and 10, 25 -35, and 95-100 
minutes post -smoking.  
Individual smoking techniques during ad -lib smoking vary to such an extent that 
differences in the THC delivered to the lungs, and absorbed into the lungs, are inevitable 
(see Robbe, 1994). To control for inter and intra -indiv idual variations, some studies have 
used a standardised smoking procedure. Sexton et al. (2000)  developed a procedure that 
was based on a literature rev iew and pilot testing. The final smoking procedures adopted is 
shown in Table 5.

Sexton et al. (2000) measured performance using a driving simulator, a hazard perception 
task, and a compensatory tracking task. The driving simulator used was a Silicon Graphics 
powered computer system that seems similar to the Mid Range Driving Simulator at  
MUARC. There were three components to the simulator drive. The first was a motorway 
drive which consisted of a 3 -lane road. Other vehicles on the road were programmed in a 
way that their actions were linked to the speed of the participants’ car. However, other 
vehicles were programmed to place the driver in two situations that required an immediate 
response (a car pulling out in front, and a car in front braking suddenly).  
The second component of the drive involved driving a ‘figure of eight’ loop. Partici pants 
were asked to drive between 30 and 40 mph through two large loops with constantly 
changing curve radii. The participants were therefore required to make continuous steering 
corrections in order to stay in the middle of the lane. The third and final c omponent of the 
drive was a dual -carriageway with four intersections with traffic lights. The signals 
changed colour as the driver approached and the reaction time to these changes was 
measured.  
The hazard perception task employed by Sexton et al. (2000) i nvolved viewing video 
recordings of situations that would require the driver to take immediate action such as 
swerving or braking suddenly. The reaction time to detect hazards and the proportion of 
hazards detected were the dependent measures. Finally, the  compensatory tracking task 
involved tracking a moving circle on a computer screen with the mouse while concurrently 
responding to the changing colour of symbols in the four corners of the screen. Visual 
Analogue Scales were used to assess mood.  
Sobriety t esting was also conducted. The impairment testing included pupil size, as 
measured by a Pupilometer; presence of lateral and vertical nystagmus and convergence; 
the walk and turn test; one leg stand; finger -nose test; and Romberg’s test with internal 
clock . A physical examination documented general demeanour and behaviour, examination 
of speech, pulse, temperature, ears, eyes, heart, lungs, blood pressure and reflexes. Results 
from the impairment testing and physical examination were used by the expert to  18 MONASH UNIVERSITY ACCIDENT RESEARCH CENTRE  determine whether the individual was impaired, and whether that impairment might be due 
to the presence of a drug. The results from the driving simulator test are summarised in 
Table 6.  
Further analyses were conducted using simulator and subjective mood dat a to compare the 
performance of those participants who were judged by the forensic medical expert to be 
impaired with the performance of those participants who were not impaired. For only three 
of the eight simulator measures was there a difference between  those participants who 
were and were not judged to be impaired (mean speed, and SDLP on the figure of eight for 
both left and right curves). For only one of the eight driving measures (SDLP for right 
curves) was there a difference between those participan ts whose condition was due to a 
drug compared to those whose condition was not due to a drug, as judged by the forensic 
medical expert.  
There was however strong agreement between the subjective estimates of the levels of 
impairment and intoxication with th e forensic medical expert’s determinations of 
impairment and whether a drug was likely to have caused that impairment. This suggest 
that the participants were acutely aware of their impairment under the influence of 
cannabis. This result also brings into q uestion the effectiveness of the placebo condition.  
The mean maximum levels of cannabis across the conditions were 11.5 mg for the low 
dose, 17.9 mg for the high dose, and 4.7 mg for the resin condition. The blood levels of 
THC (in ng/ml) at 10 and 30 minu tes after smoking for the high dose were 478 and 105, 
for the low dose were 370 and 102, and for the resin condition were 116 and 58. The 10 
minute time point was selected because it has been suggested as the time that THC 
concentrations are at their peak.  While the blood levels for the high dose were considerably 
greater at 10 minutes post -smoking than for the low dose, the blood levels are almost 
identical for the high and low dose conditions at 30 minutes post -smoking. There was not a 
strong relationship  between blood and saliva levels of THC at 10 and 30 minutes post -
smoking (which is not surprising).  
In summary, cannabis did not have a dramatic influence on driving performance. Cannabis 
reduced mean speed, which was interpreted as the participants being  aware of their 
impairment, and adjusting their performance to make the task easier and thereby 
compensating for the effects of cannabis. The primary effects of cannabis were on tracking 
ability, as seen by impaired performance on the figure of eight task.  This is consistent with 
previous research which shows that the initial effects of cannabis are on psycho -motor 
performance as opposed to higher -order cognitive processes.

3.3.2  On road studies  
An on -road study by Klonoff (1974)  found that cannabis (up to 8.4 mg) did have 
detrimental effects on driving skills and performance in a restricted driving area and even 
more so under normal  conditions of driving on city streets. There were, however, marked 
individual differences even with a similar dose and this seemed to depend on whether the 
subject could compensate for the drug effects. It should be noted however that the city 
drive perfo rmance was rated by a professional observer and not by traditional measures of 
driving performance.  
Hansteen, Miller, Lonero, & Marx (1976)  examined driving ability after placebo, 21, and 
88 µg/kg THC, and alcohol (0.07%). Part icipants drove laps marked by cones on a closed 
course. The higher dose of cannabis resulted in a greater number of cones being hit, and 
increased time to complete each lap. Alcohol however resulted in more cones being hit, 
reduced lap times, and ‘rough ha ndling’ of the car as judged by one of the study 
investigators. The particularly low dose of cannabis (about 6 mg THC) used in this study 
should be noted.   20 MONASH UNIVERSITY ACCIDENT RESEARCH CENTRE  In another study participants were given combinations of alcohol (placebo, 0.05%, & 
0.10%) and cannab is (placebo, 3.12 mg, & 6.12 mg) (Casswell, 1979) . The driving task 
included overtaking, hairpin bends, responding to traff ic signals and performing an 
auditory secondary task. Alcohol alone and in combination with cannabis resulted in 
greater SDLP, higher speed, and more course steering corrections. Cannabis with alcohol 
increased secondary reaction time. Cannabis alone also increased reaction time but was 
also associated with reduced driving speed. Casswell (1979) again concluded that drivers 
compensated for the effects of cannabis by reducing the information processing load (by 
reducing speed) while alcohol induced riskier b ehaviours. Again, it is important to note the 
low doses of cannabis used.  
The reader is directed to other reports for more detail on these and other cannabis and 
driving studies conducted before1990 (Robbe, 1994; Smiley, 1986) .  
3.3.2.1  Cannabis studies in The Netherlands  
The most comprehensive series of on -road experiments were conducted by Robbe (1994; 
1998) , in the Netherlands. Because his research contributes significantly to cannabis and 
driving research it will be disc ussed in some detail. Before discussing the four driving 
studies, it is interesting to comment on a preliminary experiment that was conducted by 
Robbe (1994)  to establish the doses of cannabis that would be used in the driving studies. 
It is particularly pertinent to mention this st udy in some detail because the findings of this 
study are often used to highlight the belief that the doses of cannabis used in experimental 
research are not realistic and are substantially lower than the levels of cannabis consumed 
by users outside the la boratory. This issue is one of the major criticisms of experimentally -
based cannabis research.  
As mentioned, the aim of Robbe’s (1994) preliminary study was to determine the 
appropriate doses of cannabis to be used in the driving studies for recreational c annabis 
users. Twenty -four participants were given the opportunity to smoke a maximum of three 
cannabis cigarettes ad lib for up to 15 mins or until they had achieved the maximum 
psychological effect. The cigarettes contained on average 20 mg THC. Of the 2 3 
participants, six consumed one cigarette, 13 smoked two, and four smoked all three 
cigarettes. The amounts of THC smoked are shown in Table 7.

  CANNABIS AND ROAD SAF ETY : A REVIEW OF RECENT L ITERATURE   21 The amount of THC smoked did not diff er for those people who smoked more than once 
per week versus those who smoked more than once a month but less than once a week. 
Participants reported their peak feelings of being ‘high’ to be on average 70% of the 
greatest ever experienced. The mean amoun t of cannabis smoked ad -lib (by body weight) 
was 308 µg/kg, and hence on the basis of these findings the maximum THC dose for the 
following experiments was set at 300 ( µg/kg). While there are undoubtedly differences in 
the smoking experiences associated wi th smoking in normal social settings compared to 
smoking in the laboratory, the dose of cannabis used here represents the mean amount that 
was used by recreational users in a 15 min period.  
Robbe’s first driving experiment examined the effects of cannabis on restricted highway 
driving. The same 24 people participated, all who used cannabis more than once a month 
but less than weekly, and all who attended four sessions with THC doses of 0 (placebo), 
100, 200, and 300 µg/kg. The average amount consumed for th e three cannabis conditions 
was 6.8, 13.6, and 20.4 mg THC, which is equivalent to 94, 186, and 282 µg/kg. The 
participants drove along an 11 km stretch of highway that was closed to traffic, which was 
referred to as the road tracking task, and were requir ed to maintain a constant speed of 90 
km/h and a steady lateral position. This was done for 20 min periods at 40 and 110 minutes 
after smoking. Blood samples were taken immediately before the driving tests.  
Females displayed higher SDLP than males, althou gh this effect was not related to 
cannabis dose. There was a significant dose effect, and all three doses of cannabis 
increased SDLP compared to placebo, but there were no differences in SDLP across 
cannabis dose. There was no difference in SDLP for the tw o driving tests. Changes in 
mean speed and standard deviation of speed and steering angle were not affected by 
cannabis. Perceived driving quality was lower for all three cannabis doses than placebo, 
and perceived effort increased with increasing doses. Ca nnabis decreased alertness, 
particularly for the first driving test. The mean plasma concentrations of THC at 30 and 90 
min post -smoking for each condition were: 100 µg/kg (9.5 & 3.5 ng/ml); 200 µg/kg (15.9 
& 4.8 ng/ml); 300 µg/kg (20.7 & 6.2 ng/ml). Blood  THC was clearly related to dose and 
time of blood sampling.  
SDLP was not correlated with plasma levels of THC, or the participants’ frequency of 
cannabis use. Excessive SDLP occurred in four subjects for each of the two highest 
cannabis conditions, but oc curred in the second drive, when plasma levels were lower. This 
illustrates the difficulty in estimating SDLP from single measures of THC (Robbe, 1994) . 
Finally, the decrements in SDLP after high dose THC were estimated to be equivalent to 
impairments at a BAC of around 0.07%, when compared to previous data by Louwerens, 
Gloerich, d Vries, Brookhuis, & O'Hanlon (1987) . 
Following on from restricted highway driving, Robbe’s second experiment was conducted 
in normal highway traffic. The doses of cannabis used were the same as in  the first study, 
and the mean amounts of cannabis consumed in the three cannabis conditions by the 16 
participants were 6.9, 13.8, and 20.7 mg. A car following task was performed 45 min after 
smoking and lasted for about 15 min. Participants then drove fo r 64 km completing the 
road tracking task which lasted about 50 min, and the performed the car following task 
again. This required the participants to respond to changes in the behaviour of a lead 
(experimental) car, which varied in speed between 80 km/h a nd 100 km/h, while 
maintaining a headway of 50 m. Blood samples were taken at 35 and 110 min after 
smoking.   22 MONASH UNIVERSITY ACCIDENT RESEARCH CENTRE  Similar to the first study, SDLP was impaired in a dose related manner, being significantly 
higher after the two highest cannabis doses. Mean speed,  and standard deviations of speed 
and steering wheel angle were not significantly affected by cannabis. In the car following 
task, mean headway was significantly greater in the low THC dose condition but the two 
higher doses had no effect. It should be not ed that participants always had the low dose of 
THC first, which had a headway of 8 m, through to the highest THC dose, which had a 
headway of 2 m. Thus, it initially appears that drivers were more cautious the first time 
they had cannabis, which was alway s the lowest dose. When adjusted for headway, 
cannabis did not affect the reaction time to respond to changes in the speed of the lead car.  
Robbe’s third experiment examined the effects of alcohol and cannabis in city driving, 
which was deemed to be more c omplex than highway driving. Cannabis (100 µg/kg) and 
placebo were administered to 16 participants, while another 16 received alcohol (0.43 
g/kg) and placebo. The average amount of THC consumed was 6.9 mg, while the mean 
BAC was 0.35% 35 min after drinking . Participants were required to drive for 17.5 km in 
urban traffic, commencing 30 min post smoking. Their performance was assessed on -line 
by a trained observer and again after the drive by a driving instructor who viewed video of 
the drive. Over one hundr ed dichotomous variables covering car control, judgement, and 
handling of the vehicle were scored. On -line ratings by the trained observer indicated that 
neither alcohol nor cannabis affected driving. Retrospective ratings, however, indicated 
that while ca nnabis did not affect driving, alcohol did. Interestingly, ratings of driving 
quality were significantly lower following cannabis use but did not change following 
alcohol use. Ratings of perceived effort were also significantly higher after smoking 
cannabi s. It is important to note the low dose of cannabis used in this study.  
The fourth study reported by Robbe (1998)  examined the combined effects of cannabis and 
alcohol. It involved highway driving with both road tracking and car following tasks. 
Participants attended six sessi ons with combinations of alcohol (placebo, dose to 0.07% 
and top ups to sustain at 0.04%) and THC (0, 100, & 200 µg/kg). Smoking commenced 60 
min after drinking, and driving commenced 30 min after smoking. Significant effects of 
THC and alcohol were found,  but no interaction. Greatest impairments were evident for 
both THC doses combined with alcohol, and only minor and moderate after 100 and 200 
µg/kg THC respectively. The impairment observed with alcohol and THC (200 µg/kg) was 
equivalent to that associate d with a BAC of 0.14% (Robbe, 1998). Drivers took 
significantly longer to react to changes in the speed of the lead car (in car following) after 
the highest THC dose was combined with alcohol.  
To summarise this work, Robbe (1994) himself concludes that hi s findings corroborate the 
findings from other simulator and on -road studies in that “THC in single inhaled doses up 
to 300 µg/kg has significant, yet not dramatic, dose -related impairing effects on driving 
performance.” (p. 170). The effects of cannabis a re indeed small because the participants 
attempt to compensate for the adverse effects of cannabis (Robbe, 1994) . The participants 
were aware of the effects of cannabis as shown by the lower ratings of driving quality and 
higher ratings of perceived effort after smoking cannabis. Ho wever, despite compensating 
by increasing headway and slightly reducing mean speed, the participants were not 
completely able to compensate for the adverse effect on SDLP. Robbe (1994)  suggests that 
this is because SDLP is primarily controlled by an automatic informa tion processing 
system that operates beyond conscious control.  
Finally, Robbe (1994)  suggests that the compensatory effects of cannabis come at a cost to 
the driver. The increased ratings of perceived effort after smoking cannabis, perhaps by 
focussing attention, wo uld lead to a reduction in spare capacity. So while drivers were able  CANNABIS AND ROAD SAF ETY : A REVIEW OF RECENT L ITERATURE   23 to maintain some basic levels of driving skill (with the exception of increased SDLP) after 
using cannabis, they may not be equally able to perform in situations of higher mental load 
(Robbe, 1994). One of the clear messages to come from this research is that there is a need 
to research the effects of cannabis in situations where the driver is required to perform 
several tasks simultaneously or when confronted with a situation that requir es a rapid 
adaptive response. This is one of the recommendations that Robbe makes in relation to 
future research.  
In subsequent research in The Netherlands, Ramaekers et al. (2000)  present the findings 
from a stud y that used a very similar methodology to that reported in the final study by 
Robbe (1998) . Again, 18 participants attended six sessions across with the same two doses 
of alcohol and three of THC, and the same road tracking and car following tasks. Every 
drug combination incre ased SDLP from double placebo. While alcohol increased SDLP by 
2.2 cm, THC doses of 100 and 200 µg/kg increased SDLP by 2.7 and 3.5 cm, and by 5.3 
and 8.5 cm when taken with alcohol. While both alcohol and THC increased the time spent 
out of the lane (TOL) , only alcohol with THC 100 and 200 µg/kg significantly increased 
TOL compared to placebo. Alcohol and THC 200 µg/kg significantly increased RT in the 
car following task, however mean headway remained stable across conditions. While 
alcohol increased stand ard deviation of headway (SDH), THC doses of  100 and 200 µg/kg 
increased SDH by 2.9 and 3.8 m without alcohol, and by a statistically significant 
(although smaller) amount with alcohol. Note, SDH reflects ability to perceive changes in 
the relative veloci ties of other vehicles and ability to adjust own speed accordingly. While 
alcohol and THC both significantly increased ratings of intoxication, the highest ratings 
were found for the two alcohol -THC combinations.  
In summary, the Ramaekers et al. (2000) stu dy shows that while alcohol and THC both 
impaired performance on the road tracking task, the combination of alcohol and THC 
impaired performance to a greater extent, equivalent to the impairment associated with 
alcohol to the 0.09 -0.14% level. Drivers all seemed well aware of their impairment.  
In the most recent study from the research group based in the Netherlands, Lamers & 
Ramaekers’ (2001) final study, 16 participants drove in city traffic over four sessions with 
combinations of  alcohol placebo or 0.0 5% BAC, and THC placebo or 100 µg/kg, 
administered in a double -blind crossover design (Lamers & Ramaekers, 2001) . In a similar 
methodology to that described by Robbe (1998), part icipants smoked 70 min and 
consumed alcohol 25 min prior to a 40 min city driving task (deemed to more demanding 
that highway driving). The 15 km route covered turns at intersections, lane changes, and 
responses to traffic signals. Eye movements were recor ded, and a driving instructor in the 
front seat rated the drivers’ performance in accordance with a modified version of the 
Dutch Driving Proficiency Test. Performance on the driving test was not affected by drug 
condition. The frequency of visual search f or traffic at intersections was similar for 
placebo, alcohol alone, and THC alone conditions, but reduced significantly for alcohol & 
THC. In accordance with some previous research, this finding was interpreted as 
corresponding to the drivers being less ab le to respond to peripheral traffic while 
maintaining performance on the central driving task. The very low dose of THC 
administered in this study should be noted.  
3.3.3  Summary  
In her comprehensive review of the effects of cannabis on simulator and on -road 
performance, Smiley (1986)  concluded that people experiencing the effect s of cannabis 
appear to be aware of their impairment and where possible they compensate by, for  24 MONASH UNIVERSITY ACCIDENT RESEARCH CENTRE  example, slowing down, focussing attention and not taking risks (like overtaking). 
However, this compensation is not possible when the driver encounters unexpec ted events 
and/or when the driver is placed in situations requiring increased mental load or continuous 
attention (Robbe, 1994; Smiley, 1986) . 
Discussions  of compensation aside, recent research is continuing to show that cannabis, 
both alone and with alcohol, impairs aspects of driving performance. The predominant 
form of impairment observed after smoking cannabis alone is an increase in lane weaving 
behavi our. Use of cannabis alone has also been associated with increased variability in  
headway to a lead vehicle. This is an important finding because it is commonly interpreted 
as reflecting the ability to perceive changes in the relative velocities of other vehicles and 
the ability to adjust one’s own speed accordingly, which is suggestive of impaired 
perceptual abilities. Cannabis has also been found to lead to increased reaction time to 
respond in an emergency decision -making task.  
When cannabis is combined  with alcohol, variability of headway is again increased, and 
variability in lane weaving behaviour is increased to a greater extent than for cannabis 
alone, which is again indicative of impaired performance. Furthermore, drivers with both 
cannabis and alc ohol take significantly longer to react to changes in the speed of the lead 
car (in car following), which is suggestive of a decrease in safety. To illustrate, the 
combination of a moderate dose of alcohol and cannabis is found to produce impairment to 
a level observed at a BAC of 0.14%. Finally, the frequency of visual search for traffic at 
intersections has been found to be similar for placebo, alcohol alone, and cannabis alone, 
but reduced significantly for alcohol & cannabis. In accordance with some pre vious 
research, this finding suggests that drivers are less able to respond to peripheral traffic 
while maintaining performance on the central driving task.  
It is important to note that there are methodological concerns that continue to manifest in 
some st udies of the effects of cannabis on driving. For several years there has been concern 
that the levels of cannabis used in experimental research are much lower than those used 
by moderate to heavy recreational users. Furthermore, different measures of drivi ng 
performance show different effects. For example, while use of cannabis has been found to 
impair vehicle control (lane weaving) and headway (Ramaekers et al., 2000; Robbe, 1998) , 
no effect has been found on brake reaction time (Liguori, Gatto, & Jarrett, 2002; Liguori, 
Gatto, Jarrett, & Vaughn McCall, 2003) . However, because in this later study, as in many 
others, THC levels in bodily samples were not measured, it is difficult to reach a firm 
conclusion about the extent  of cannabis -related impairments to performance.   CANNABIS AND ROAD SAF ETY : A REVIEW OF RECENT L ITERATURE   25 4. MEASURING CANNABI S USE AT THE ROADSID E 
The literature reviewed in previous sections has demonstrated that cannabis is present to 
different degrees in samples of drivers who are suspected of driving under the influence of 
drugs and/or alcohol or who are injured, and that cannabis does impair many aspects of 
simulator and on -road driving performance. From an enforcement viewpoint, it is 
important to examine how to detect drivers who are driving under the inf luence of drugs 
such as cannabis.  
Broadly speaking there are two approaches that are being researched and used world -wide 
to detect drug use, including cannabis use, at the roadside. The first, and the one that is 
very actively being researched, is the abi lity to screen for drugs in different samples. The 
major samples under investigation are blood, urine, sweat, and saliva. The second approach 
is to determine drug -related impairment by measuring performance on standardised tests. 
Both of these approaches a re being used for law enforcement in Victoria (see Swann, 
Boorman, & Potter, 2004).  
4.1 MEASURING CANNAB IS USE IN BODILY SPE CIMENS  
Much research world wide is being directed toward the development of a reliable measure 
of drug use that can be used in the field, and the majority of this research is taking place in 
Europe. The samples that can potentially be used to conduct drug analyses are blood, urine, 
sweat, saliva, and hair (Dolan, Rouen, & Kimber, 2004: Samyn, Viaene, Vandevenne, & 
Verstraete, 1999) . Blood sampling represents the most accurate means for conducting drug 
analyses, however it is not a practical means of testing for drug use in the field such as at 
mining sit es or on the roadside. Aside from the practical issues of mass screening drivers 
and taking blood in the field, it takes at least 24 hours to obtain a blood drug screen, which 
is not suitable for roadside screening purposes. Furthermore, there is still muc h that 
remains unclear about the relationship between blood levels of a drug such as cannabis and 
subsequent performance levels. Even less is known about the relationships between levels 
of drugs in other specimens and performance levels. It is known howev er that recent 
cannabis use is indicative of performance impairment. The majority of effort is being 
directed towards evaluating saliva -based measures of drug use . Saliva has also been 
identified as the preferred specimen by police forces and experts acros s the European 
Union (Moeller et al., 1999) .  
One of the issues that complicates the measurement of drug use in alternative samples is 
the pharmac okinetics of each individual drug. Each drug is metabolised in different ways 
and is present in different proportions in different specimens (Kidwell, Holland, & 
Athanaselis, 1998) . For example, THC is present in high levels in blood but only in very 
low levels in saliva (Kintz, Cirimele, Mairot, Muhlmann, & Ludes, 2000; Samyn & van 
Haeren, 2000) . As a consequence, a specimen that may be a good measure of recent drug 
use for one drug may not necessarily also be a good measure of recent drug use for other 
drugs. The fo llowing discussions focus on the detection of cannabis in alternative samples.  
4.1.1  Urine analysis  
While urine drug screening is an effective means for detecting recent use of drugs such as 
heroin (Cone, Welch, Mitchell, & Paul, 1991) , it is not a good measure of recent cannabis 
use. Although many other metabolites are excreted in urine, it is the inactive carboxy -
metabolite (THC -COOH) that serves as a target for urine drug testing. The p resence of 
THC -COOH in urine is useful as a marker for previous cannabis use, but not as an  26 MONASH UNIVERSITY ACCIDENT RESEARCH CENTRE  indicator of recent use and impairment (Crouch, Frank, Farrell, Karsch, & Klaunig, 1998; 
Rebekah, Crouch, & Cook, 2000; Samyn, 2000; Tow t et al., 1995; Wennig et al., 1998) . 
For example, chronic use of cannabis can be detectable for more than 30 days post -use 
(Cone, 1993) . There is also substantial variation in urine THC -COOH levels between 
subjects and between doses (Huestis, Mitchell, & Cone, 1996) . Several urine tests are now 
available that provide results within minutes, and a full inventory of available devices, 
accompa nied with evaluation data, has been published (Samyn et al., 1999) . These devices 
still cannot detect recent  cannabis use reliably, and it is probable that this  will not be 
possible through analysis of urine.  
4.1.2  Hair analysis  
Many studies have examined the efficacy of hair analysis as a means of measuring drug 
use (Cooper et al., 2000; Montagna, Stramesi, Vignali, Groppi, & Polettini, 2000; Quintela 
et al., 2000; Ricossa, Be rnini, & Ferrari, 2000; Tagliaro et al., 2000) . While it may be 
useful for forensic testing post -mortem, hair testing is unlikely to be a very useful means of 
measuring drug use at the roadside. Aside from the practical issues of hair analysis being 
condu cted at the roadside, analysis of drug use in hair samples will only indicate the long 
term exposure or use of drugs (Spiehler, 2000) . For example, in an Outreach Program in 
the United States, hair analysis confirmed that  a much higher proportion of the client group 
had used cocaine than did urine analysis (which is more indicative of recent cocaine 
use)(Martinez et al., 1993) . It is also difficult to determine details of the time of use and the 
dose used (Wennig, 2000) . The presence of a drug in a hair sample is therefore not 
necessarily going to be indicative of any drug -related imp airment. Furthermore there is a 
six to eight hour time lag between use of a drug and the appearance of traces of that drug in 
hair. The majority of the drug detectable in hair does not appear until one to two weeks 
after drug use, after the hair shaft cont aining the drug grows beyond the surface of the skin 
(Spiehler, 2000) . It is also not known how age, gender, ethnicity, and various hair 
treatments affect drug levels in hair (Wennig, 2000) . A combination of these factors means 
that hair analysis of drugs is not likely to be a practical and valid measure of drug use in 
the field.  
4.1.3  Sweat analysis  
While drugs detectable on the skin surface can be excreted from sweat glands, they can 
also be excreted via sebaceous glands or transdermal liquid transport (Sachs, 2000) . There 
are two general sweat testing procedures. In the first, sweat was typically collected by 
sweat patches that remained in contact with the skin for 1 -7 days, and then the sweat was 
extracted f or toxicological analysis. The second form of testing involves analysis of 
samples within minutes through the use of on -site devices such as Drugwipe which can 
screen for drugs in sweat within minutes.  
A review of the applications of the Drugwipe screening  device for sweat testing has been 
published (Mura et al., 2000) . Drugwipe has been used to collect sweat from the forehead, 
the palm, the armpit, and the neck or back. A lack of sensitivity was reported for all four 
drug classes examined (opiat es, cannabis, amphetamines, cocaine). The proportion of false 
negatives was 27% for opiates, 75% for cannabinoids, 37% for amphetamines, and 24% 
for cocaine. To a smaller extent, false positives have also been found for cannabinoids 
(11%) and cocaine (10%) , but this was associated with collection of sweat from the armpit. 
As was the case for saliva, Mura et al. (2000) suggested that, until new antibodies with a 
higher sensitivity for THC or opiates are developed, the Drugwipe should not be 
considered as a g ood tool for on -site detection of drugs of abuse in sweat.   CANNABIS AND ROAD SAF ETY : A REVIEW OF RECENT L ITERATURE   27 Drugs may remain present for up to three weeks in sweat, and so it is not possible to 
pinpoint the time of drug consumption and there the period of impairment. It has been 
suggested that while swe at testing may be an appropriate means drug screening for 
prisoners on weekend leave, it is likely to be of little use for roadside testing (Sachs, 2000) .  
4.1.4  Analysis of oral fluid  
Oral fluid was identified as the preferred specimen for roadside drug screening in the 
European Union several years ago (Moeller et al., 1999) , and it remains the preferred 
medium (Verstraete, 2004). Preferably, devices should provide clear and unambiguous test 
results within five minutes. The five drug types identified in Europe, in order of decreasing 
priority, were cannabis, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, cocaine, and opiates. A device 
was preferred that could screen for these five drug types as part of the one test (Moeller et 
al., 1999) . 
As noted previously by other authors, there have been few published evaluation studies of 
oral fluid screening devices (e.g., Walsh, de Gier, Christopherson, & Verstraete, 2004; 
Verstraete, 2004). An early model of the RapiScan device was evaluated in Melbourne by  
comparing three mechanisms of examining drug use by injecting drug users, who are 
known to be co nsumers of a variety of drugs (Lenné et al., 2000) . The three methods 
examined were: (1) self -report; (2) blood drug screens; and (3) saliva screening  through the 
use of a saliva sampling device. The Rapiscan device produced by Cozart Bioscience 
Limited was used to test saliva samples with 5 -drug panels (Catalogue No. CZR500, Lot 
Number 19471, Exp 07/2000). These drug panels allowed screening for the fo llowing five 
drug types as part of the one test; o piates, benzodiazepines, cannabis (THC), cocaine, and 
amphetamines. While THC was found in the blood of 10 of the 13 participants who 
reported recent use of cannabis (six hours prior), there were no positiv e saliva results using 
the RapiScan device. At the time of conducting this study the device cut -off for THC was 
600 ng/ml. It was recommended that further work be done refining the device to improve 
the sensitivity to THC. European data also suggested that  early models of this device 
lacked the sensitivity to reliably detect THC in oral fluid (Verstraete & Puddu, 2000). It 
should be noted that the sensitivity of these devices is constantly improving.  
The early models of the Drugwipe screening test have also  been evaluated in several 
studies conducted in the late 1990’s. While very few false positives or negatives were 
found when testing for cocaine and amphetamines, a high rate of false positives was found 
for opiates (35%). The results for cannabinoids were  the poorest with high proportions of 
false negatives (40%) and a false positive rate as high as 28% in one study (see Mura et al., 
2000) . The detection limits of the device for THC were however not specified. Again using 
an early model Drugwipe  device, a study by Samyn and van Haeren (2000) sampled 27 
participants who displayed signs of intoxication, of whom 15 reported recent use of 
cannabis. The stated surface sensitivity of the device was 50 ng/ml for THC. Samyn and 
van Haeren (2000) reported  three false positives and nine false negatives from the 15 who 
reported recent cannabis use. It was suggested at that time that new antibodies with a 
higher sensitivity for THC were required to improve the Drugwipe test for cannabis (Mura 
et al., 2000; Samyn & van Haeren, 2000) .  
The majority of research has been conducted in Europe as part of a large research program 
that focussed on roadside drug testing. This work, part of the ROSITA projec t, examined 
the relationship between levels of drugs in blood, urine, and saliva, using a range of drug 
screening devices, in nearly 3,000 samples (Verstraete, 2000;  Verstraete & Puddu, 2000 ). 
This research confirmed that oral fluid testing is the most pr omising alternative to blood  28 MONASH UNIVERSITY ACCIDENT RESEARCH CENTRE  screening for drugs, but concluded that tests available at that time were not satisfactory. 
There is much effort is being directed towards the development of drug screening tests, and 
advances in technology are improving the de tection limits of the devices. It is timely 
therefore that a new program of evaluation has commenced under the ROSITA -2 project 
(Verstraete, 2004). Newer on -site oral fluid tests are being evaluated across six countries in 
Europe and five states in the Uni ted States through a series of laboratory and field -based 
evaluations. Preliminary data from some laboratory evaluations in the United States are 
published. The experimental protocol involved challenging each device with a low, 
medium, and high concentrati on of the target drug, as well as a drug -free control. Known 
levels of drugs were added to samples of oral fluid in this laboratory -based study (for 
further details on experimental protocol see Walsh, Flegel, Crouch, Cangianelli, & Baudys, 
2003) . The results showed that three of the six oral fluid tests evaluated (Uplink, cut -off 25 
ng/ml; Drugwipe, cut -off 30 ng/ml; RapiScan, cut -off 150 ng/ml) could reliably detect 
THC at the high level (50 ng/ml), and importantly no false positives were reported (Walsh, 
Flegel, Crouch, & Cangianellil, 2004). The results from the field -based evaluations from 
ROSITA -2 are yet to be published. A laboratory -based testing program of oral fluid 
screening devices for THC and methamphetamine has recently been undertaken in Victoria 
(Swann et al., 2004). The authors of the present report are unaware of any published data 
from this  program.  
Other authors have noted the requirement for published evaluations of oral fluid screening 
devices, and the need to improve the sensitivity for detection of THC (Walsh, de Gier, et 
al., 2004; Verstraete, 2004). Ongoing research and development in  the area of drug 
detection will lead to continued rapid improvements in the sensitivity of these devices in 
the near future.   
4.2 MEASURING DRUG I MPAIRMENT USING PERF ORMANCE TESTING  
As discussed in the preceding section, developing an accurate and valida ted test to screen 
for drugs at the roadside has been challenging. Law enforcement has therefore had to seek 
alternative means for establishing driving impairment in the field. In Victoria, the 
Standardised Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) were introduced. Perf ormance on these tests, 
accompanied by blood drug screens and roadside assessments, is used to determine 
whether a person had been driving while impaired by a drug (see Wylie & Swann, 2000) . 
The implementation of such legislation was recommended in a 1996 Parliamentary Road 
Safety Committee repor t (Victorian Parliamentary Road Safety Committee, 1996) . Data 
from 2002 suggest that 96% of the drivers (n=100) who failed the SFST were p ositive for 
one or more drugs, while 30% were positive for THC (Gerostamoulos, McCaffrey, 
Drummer, & Odell, 2002).  
The SFST battery was developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
(NHTSA) in the United States. It was introduced in 1981 to help determine whether drivers 
who were suspected of driving while intoxicated had BACs greater than 0.10%. The SFST 
is now used in all 50 states in the United States. It includes the horizontal gaze nystagmus 
test, the one leg stand test, and the walk and turn test (Stuster & B urns, 1998) . 
Using the SFST battery, recent research has also shown that police officers can estimate 
whether a driver has a BAC above 0.08% with as high as 94% accuracy. Furthermore, the 
officers could estimate whether a drivers’ BAC was above 0.04% but below 0.08% in 94% 
of the decisions to arrest (Stuster & Burns, 1998) . It was suggested by Stuster and Burns 
(1998)  that the SFST battery was clearly valid to discriminate above or below 0.08%, and  CANNABIS AND ROAD SAF ETY : A REVIEW OF RECENT L ITERATURE   29 that results strongly indicated that that SFST could also accurately discriminate above or 
below 0.04%.  
While the SFST battery has been used in the US to test for alcohol impairment, it has been 
expanded to the Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) Program. This program encompasses a 
greater number and range of tests than the SFST, and enables police off icers to determine 
whether or not a driver is impaired by drugs (other than alcohol), and then to determine the 
type of drug causing the observable impairment (Burns, 1986; Burns & Adler, 1995; 
Kosnoski, Yolton, Citek, Hayes, & Evans, 1998; Page, 2000) .  
The DRE Program is a 12 s tep process that, in the year 2000, was used across 34 states in 
the US (see Page, ( 2000) for further details). The first step is conducted by a police officer 
(a breath test), however the remaining 11 stages are performed by an expert. Based upon 
interview, physical tests, performance tests, and toxicology results, the DRE fo rms an 
opinion of whether the driver is impaired by drugs other than alcohol. The DRE can then 
attribute the observable impairment to the consumption of one of seven drug categories: 
CNS depressants (including alcohol), inhalants, phencyclidine (PCP), cann abis, CNS 
stimulants, hallucinogens, and narcotics.  
The DRE program has been evaluated in two experimental studies (Heishman, Singleton, 
& Crouch, 1996, 1998) . In the first study, 28 DREs were required to assess 18 participants  
who were given alcohol (0, 0.28. & 0.52 g/kg), cocaine (4, 48, & 96 mg/70kg), and 
cannabis (0, 1.75, & 3.55% THC). When the DRE’s concluded that the participants were 
impaired by drugs other than alcohol, their conclusions were consistent with the toxicol ogy 
results in only 44% of cases (Heishman et al., 1996) . However, individual measures in the 
test were used to accurately predict the administration of alcohol, cocaine, and cannabis. 
While predictive validity was optimal when 17 -28 of the 100 variables were considered, 
high accuracy (80 to 92%) was achieved when using a five variable model. This sug gests 
that predictions of impairment may be improved if the DREs focussed on a subset of 
variables associated with each drug class (Heishman et al., 1996) . 
In the second study 48 participants were given three doses of alprazolam, d -amphetamine, 
codeine, or cannabis (n=12 for each drug group). When DREs concluded that a participant 
was impaired, their decisions were consistent with the administration of any active drug 
class in 76% of cases, but consistent with toxicology in 32% of cases. Consistency with 
toxicology was highest for cannabis (45.2%). Hence, while the DREs were able to detect 
drug-induced  impairment, they experienced difficulty discriminating between the drug 
classes. It was suggested that accuracy might be improved if the DRE program focussed on 
key variables identified by mathematical models. It must be noted however that fewer cues 
indicative of drug use were available to the DREs in these experimental settings compared 
to in the field (such as the observation of impaired driving, the presence of drugs or drug -
related equipment in car, or the smell of a drug such as cannabis). The DREs i n the study 
were also not allowed to interview the participants as they would have in the field (drivers 
will often admit drug use when interviewed). Accuracy in these experimental settings is 
therefore likely to be reduced compared to accuracy in the fiel d. Nonetheless, the DRE 
program is hailed as a great success in the United States (Heishman et  al., 1998) . While 
there is certainly room for improved accuracy with these testing procedures, it should be 
acknowledged that finding a series of tests that are sensitive to such a diverse range of drug 
effects is a challenging task.   30 MONASH UNIVERSITY ACCIDENT RESEARCH CENTRE    CANNABIS AND ROAD SAF ETY : A REVIEW OF RECENT L ITERATURE   31 5. CONCLUSION  
Ther e are a significant number of Australians, and particularly young Australians, who are 
using cannabis. Recent surveys suggest that over half of all young males in Australia report 
ever having used cannabis, and just under half report using recently. Cannab is is also 
prevalent in meaningful proportions of drivers randomly screened at the roadside, in 
drivers suspected of driving under the influence of drugs, and in injured drivers. While it 
remains unclear to what extent members of the community and recreati onal cannabis users 
drive while impaired by cannabis, there is some evidence that regular cannabis users drive 
very frequently at times in which they are highly likely to be impaired, that is, immediately 
after using or while using cannabis. Furthermore, t here is evidence that heavy drug users 
are not aware of the potentially impairing effects of drugs, alone, and in combination, on 
driving skills, and that they would not change their drug use and driving behaviour if 
tougher drug -driving legislation were i ntroduced. Clearly there is a need for the 
development of a long -term educational program targeted towards attitudinal change 
amongst drug users who drive. Further research is also required to understand the extent of 
drug driving in the wider community.  
Recent advances in analytical methods of drug detection have been able to differentiate 
between cannabinoids and THC, which has enabled researchers to demonstrate increased 
crash culpability associated with the recent use of cannabis. Nevertheless, there re mains a 
need to conduct large epidemiological studies to further understand the prevalence of drugs 
such as cannabis in both the general driving community and crash involved drivers.  
The review of the effects of cannabis on simulated and on -road driving hi ghlights the 
complex effects that cannabis exerts on driving skills. Taken in isolation, some changes in 
behaviour, such as a reduction in average speed, have been linked to the notion that drivers 
are able to compensate, to an extent, for the effects of c annabis. It is important however to 
focus on a wider range of performance measures. Cannabis typically impairs lateral 
placement, resulting in a greater degree of lane weaving, and produces greater variability 
in headway. This latter finding is important b ecause it is commonly interpreted as 
reflecting the ability to perceive changes in the relative velocities of other vehicles and the 
ability to adjust speed accordingly, and is suggestive of impaired perceptual abilities. The 
effects of cannabis alone on o ther variables such as reaction time and decision time, in the 
context of driving, are less clearly defined. This review, and others (e.g., Ramaekers et al., 
2004)  have concluded that cannabis does impair aspects of driving performance. When 
cannabis is combined with alcohol, driving ability is impaired to a greater extent than for 
cannabis alone, as indicated through measures of vehicle control and responses to other 
vehicles. The combination of a moderate dose of alcohol and cannabis has been reported t o 
produce impairment similar to that observed at a BAC of 0.14%.  
As previous researchers have suggested, it is critical to examine the effects of cannabis 
when the driver in placed in situations involving increased mental load. This represents a 
shift in the experimental research away from looking simply at the effects of cannabis on 
traditional measures of driving performance such as lateral placement and speed, and a 
move towards supplementing traditional measures with investigation of the effects of 
cannabis when a driver is placed in an unexpected high accident risk situation that requires 
an immediate decision and response. Furthermore, it is not known how cannabis affects 
inexperienced and experienced drivers in these situations. These issues are bein g further 
addressed in a simulator study that is being conducted by the Department of Psychology 
and MUARC.   32 MONASH UNIVERSITY ACCIDENT RESEARCH CENTRE  Many different methods of drug detection are actively being researched. Saliva screening 
is the most favoured approach to detecting cannabis use in the field. Saliva drug screening 
for field use offers practical advantages over other forms of drug screening such as blood, 
urine, hair, and sweat testing. Furthermore, a critical advantage is that the psychoactive 
component of cannabis and the indicator or recent cannabis use, THC, can be detected in 
saliva. While preliminary published data suggest that some devices can detect THC at 
accepted levels (50 ng/ml or less), a recent European report has noted, at the time of 
publication, the need for further pu blished evaluations of oral fluid screening devices, 
particularly to improve the sensitivity for detection of THC (Verstraete, 2004). Ongoing 
research and development in the area of drug detection will lead to continued rapid 
improvements in the sensitivit y of these devices.  
In light of the extent of cannabis use, the prevalence of cannabis in various driver samples, 
the evidence of the impairing effects on driving, and the emphasis worldwide on 
establishing enforcement regimes for driving while impaired, i t is important that further 
research continues to enhance the understanding of the road -safety implications of drug 
use.

 The Federal Government of Australia recently announced that it would legalise the growing of marijuana for medicinal and scientific purposes. Although key elements of marijuana hold promise as a therapeutic agent for several conditions, such as chronic pain, controlling seizures, and improving psychiatric symptoms, recreational marijuana use is associated with substantial adverse effects including cognitive impairment and psychological problems. Indeed, the pros and cons of marijuana remain a fiercely debated medical, scientific, public and political topic. Emerging evidence suggests that the extent to which brain-related harms manifest from marijuana use depends on interactions between the two primary elements of marijuana plant matter: delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is psychotogenic and neurotoxic; and cannabidiol (CBD), which has purported neuroprotective properties to offset the adverse effects of THC. There is, however, a lack of evidence as to whether increased CBD levels over prolonged periods of exposure maintains the neuroprotective properties and minimises marijuana-related harms. And, it is this knowledge gap that is limiting the national conversation on the legal status of marijuana for therapeutic applications and personal use, and that, importantly, raises significant ethical issues for healthcare providers seeking evidence-based treatment recommendations. Professor Murat Yücel, Lead of MICCN’s Addiction Program, has been awarded a four-year NHMRC Project Grant to investigate whether, in fact, the neuroprotective properties of CBD can be therapeutic against THC-related brain and psychosocial harms. “Addressing this question is critical considering the increasingly liberal policies towards the use and trade of marijuana products and the low CBD levels in typical street marijuana in Australia”, Professor Yücel said. “We will be conducting the first comprehensive examination of the links between prolonged exposure to varying concentrations of CBD within marijuana, brain injury and protection, and associated cognitive and psychological factors, in the hope that our discoveries can guide informed, evidence-based treatments that will ultimately improve the lives of thousands.” MICCN congratulates Professor Yücel on the award of the grant.

The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) defines epilepsy as a disease of the brain,   diag- nosis of which requires: (a) at least two unpro-voked seizures occurring >24 
hours apart; (b) one unprovoked seizure and a probability for further seizures of at least 60%, occurring over the next 10 years or (c) the diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome.
1 Between 70% and 80% of patients with new-onset epilepsy achieve complete seizure control using antiepileptic drugs such as valproate or carbamaz - epine.2 In 20%–30%  who are drug-resistant,3 4 there is great interest in investigating novel agents to reduce seizure frequency and severity. For the purposes of this review, the ILAE’s definition of drug-resistant epilepsy—the failure of adequate trials of two tolerated and appropriately chosen and used antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) schedules (as either monotherapies or in combination) to achieve seizure freedom
5—is used. For the 30% of patients who experience drug-resistant epilepsy, the efficacy of alternative and adjunctive therapies is likely to be of great interest.Preclinical studies suggest that naturally occur - ring cannabinoids (phytocannabinoids) have anti-convulsant effects which are mediated by the endocannabinoid system.
6 Cannabidiol  (CBD) and cannabidivarin have shown antiseizure effects in both in vivo and in vitro models. In contrast to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), CBD does not produce euphoric or intrusive psychoactive side effects when used to treat seizures.
7 Cannabinoids have been proposed as an adjunctive treatment for epilepsy
7 and parents of children with epilepsy report using CBD products.
8–10 There are a number of phase III human trials underway of CBD as an adjunctive therapy for treatment resistant paedi-atric and adult epilepsies.

Recently Israel, the Netherlands, Germany and Canada have legislated to allow the use of cannabi - noids for medicinal purposes. In Australia, Federal and state legislation that allows doctors to prescribe cannabinoids is being implemented. Systematic reviews are required to synthesise the evidence for individual conditions for which cannabinoids may be used to inform clinical practice and patient guidance.This review considers evidence on the safety and efficacy of cannabinoids as adjunctive treatments for drug-resistant epilepsy. As previous reviews noted a lack of controlled studies,
13 14 we synthe-sised evidence from randomised
 controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies.

supplementary materials 2) Please note that there is considerable material documenting both the methods and the results of this review in the online supple- mentary materials, which we recommend reviewing.
data sources and search strategy
To identify individual studies examining cannabinoids to treat epilepsy, the electronic databases Medline, Embase and PsycINFO, and the clinical trials registries: 
 clinicaltrials.  
gov , the EU clinical trials register (www. clin ical 
tria lsre gister. eu) and the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR, www. 
anzctr. 
org. 
au) were searched in October 2017 using terms shown
 
in
 
bo
x
 
1
 (corresponding subject headings in each data-base were used where specialised thesauri existed). We addition-ally searched reference lists of systematic reviews identified as relevant. Searches were limited to studies published from 1980 to 9
 
October 2017 on human subjects, in any language. The Medline search is provided in online
 
supplementary materials 
4.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Studies were included in the review if they administered plant-based and pharmaceutical cannabinoids to prevent or treat epilepsy and epileptic seizures in participants of any age, with any type of epilepsy or seizure. We included all experimental and epidemiological study designs including RCTs, non-RCTs, quasi-experimental, before and after studies, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, analytical cross-sectional studies, self-report surveys and case reports.Studies were excluded from the review if they were reviews of mechanisms of cannabinoid systems, commentary and review articles.
study screening
T wo reviewers independently examined titles and abstracts in the web-based systematic review program, Covidence.
15 Rele- vant articles were obtained in full, and assessed for inclusion independently by two reviewers. Inter-reviewer disagreement on inclusion was discussed with an aim to reach consensus. A third reviewer was consulted when consensus could not be reached by the two initial reviewers.
Outcomes
We considered primary and secondary outcomes suggested by the International League Against Epilepsy’s Commission on Outcome Measurement.
16 17 The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who experienced a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients achieving complete seizure freedom; quality of life indicators (including changes in mood, behaviour, sleep, attention, speech and cognitive, social and motor skills); withdrawal from the study (due to adverse events
 (AEs) or 
other reasons) and AEs.Assessment of risk of bias
Methodological quality ratings for risk of bias in RCTs were determined using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool.
18 RCTs were judged to have an overall low risk of bias if they had six to eight risk domains rated as having a low risk of bias, unclear risk if four or more domains were judged as being unclear and high risk if three or more domains were judged as being high risk. Observational or case study reports were evaluated using risk of bias in non-randomised studies - of interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for assessing risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions.
19 Overall risk of bias was determined by the most serious risk of bias allocated to that study across the tool. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion, or with the input of a third reviewer.
grading of evidence
An evidence grade was given to each reported study, based on the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool.
18 Randomised, double-blind place- bo-controlled trials were considered to be of the highest quality, but ratings could be downgraded where there were instances of bias or poor design. Single case studies or self-report studies were considered to be of very low quality. We additionally conducted a GRADE assessment using GRADEPro (https:// 
gradepro. 
org/) for each reported pooled estimate to evaluate 
the risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias, resulting in an overall GRADE rating for each outcome. GRADE assessments were conducted independently by two reviewers with disagreements resolved via consensus with a third reviewer.
data extraction
Data were extracted from studies using a standardised data extraction tool in Microsoft Office Excel 2016. The data extracted from studies included specific details about the inter - vention, populations, study methods and outcomes of signif - icance to the review question and specific objectives. Data extraction tools were piloted and reviewed by the authors before being finalised (see online
 
supplementary materials 5 for fields extracted).During the review, clinical experts reviewed the extracted data and gave feedback on the need to define drug-resistant epilepsy, distinguishing between paediatric and adult epilepsies and distinguishing between AEs and serious adverse events
 
(SAEs). A
ccordingly, we extracted whether studies identified their participants as having drug-resistant epilepsies, in line with the ILAE definition,
5 namely, the failure of two or more tolerated and appropriately chosen AEDs, used either in combination or as monotherapy, to achieve complete seizure freedom (see online supplementary materials 3 for a summary of this defi-nition). Paediatric epilepsies were defined as those occurring in persons between the ages of 0 and 18 years. We also extracted concurrent AEDs reported by the participants.All reported AEs, including SAEs and treatment-related adverse events

Where studies reported multiple points of follow-up data, we extracted the longest follow-up within each study.
Analysis
All analyses were conducted using Stata V .15.0.20 We expected high levels of heterogeneity between studies due to differences in sociodemographic and clinical profiles, thus all outcomes were analysed using DerSimonian and Laird inverse-variance random effects meta-analysis.
21 For RCTs, the relative risk (RR) of participants in the treatment groups achieving study outcomes relative to participants in the comparison group were estimated using the ‘metan’ command. For observational studies with no comparison group, the proportion of participants achieving study outcomes were pooled using the prevalence command, ‘metaprop’ using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transforma-tion to stabilise variances and prevent exclusion of studies where proportions approached 0 or 1.
20 22 For dichotomous outcomes from RCTs, we calculated numbers needed to treat (NNT) and numbers needed to harm (NNH) and their 95% CIs. We used pooled estimates of relative effect (ie, RRs) to take into account the event rate in control groups.
23 NNT was calculated for the outcomes 50% or greater reduction in seizures, complete seizure freedom and quality of life. NNH was calculated for all-cause AEs, SAEs, TSAEs and study withdrawals due to AEs.Heterogeneity in all pooled estimates was summarised using the I
2 statistic and was described as being unimportant for values between 0% and 30%, moderate for 31%–60%, substantial for 61%–75% 
and considerable for 76%–100%.18Where sufficient data were available, we conducted subgroup analyses on the basis of epilepsy type (such as Dravet or Lennox-Gastaut syndromes); sample age (paediatric vs  adult or mixed aged samples) and overall risk of bias rating.
rEsulT s
Searches identified 445 articles (see figure 1 ). An additional 11 poster abstracts were sourced through the American Epilepsy Society conference database
24 and the  authors were  contacted for further details. Three additional papers were published and iden-tified through hand-search by the authors after the initial data-base search, and eight papers were identified via hand-searches of systematic review reference lists. After title and abstract screening, 91 articles were selected for full-text screening. Of these, 35 papers (comprising 36 individual studies) met criteria for inclusion in the review (table
 
1 and online
 
supplementary materials 6, table A4; see online
 
supplementary materials 9 for excluded studies). We additionally identified 10 ongoing studies that met inclusion criteria but for which results have not yet been published (see online supplementary materials 10).Of the six randomised trials, four were parallel double-blind placebo-controlled trials,
25–28 one was a cross-over study29 and one was a randomised placebo-controlled trial with limited details of blinding.

Characteristics of study participants
The RCTs included a total of 555 patients (range: 12–225), all of whom had drug-resistant epilepsy. The mean age of participants, where reported, was 16.3 years (range: 2.3–49) and the mean percentage of males was approximately 48.3% (range: 26.7%–52%). T wo RCTs
27 28 examined Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, one26 examined Dravet syndrome and the remaining studies
25 29 30 reported on ‘mixed’ epilepsy syndromes.In comparison, the non-RCT studies included 2865 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (range: 1–976), whom had a mean age of 15 years (range: 0.5–50). The percentage of males was approximately 48.6% (range: 0%–100%). Nine of the non-RCT studies examined Dravet syndrome either primarily or as a subgroup within a larger sample,
9 32 35 39 44 46 49 52 53 eight exam- ined Lennox-Gastaut syndrome,
9 32 35 41 46 49 52 53 four studies examined Doose syndrome,
46 49 52 53 the remaining studies exam-ined mixed epilepsy syndromes
8 9 11 12 31–35 37 38 40 42–54 and two studies
36 55 did not specify epilepsy subtype.
Cannabinoids used and features of treatment
The RCTs all studied CBD with a placebo comparator; CBD was an adjuvant treatment in all cases. The more recent studies that describe data based on participant weight
26–28 reported a CBD range of 2.5–20  
mg/kg/day across a mean treatment length of 14 weeks. Earlier RCTs
25 29 30 reported using 100  mg of CBD administered 2–3 times per day for a treatment period between 8 and 26 weeks.Cannabinoids used in the non-RCT studies varied, but CBD was most commonly used (n=15
9 11 12 31–35 37 41 43 45 46 49 52); four studies examined a combined CBD:THC extract
39 44 54; six examined cannabis sativa
8 36 40 47 48 50; one examined dronab-inol
38 and the remaining studies reported various other canna-binoid formulations. Cannabinoids were used as an adjuvant therapy, with a treatment range between 10 days and 7.5 years.
risk of bias
Table  1  and online supplementary materials 6, table A4 include the quality assessment ratings for each of the included studies (see also online supplementary materials 6, figures A1 and A2). Of the six RCTs included in the review, only one was judged to be at a low risk of bias,
26 one study was judged to be high25 and the remaining four were judged to have an unclear risk of bias
27–30 (see online   supplementary materials 6,  figures A1 and A2), primarily due to lack of detail.Non-randomised trials were mostly 
judged to be at serious  
to critical risk of bias, particularly those with self-reported outcomes on self-selected participant samples (see 
online supplementary materials 6, figure A3). The lack of randomisation, blinding and control groups in these studies mean that their results can at most be indicators of clinical experience rather than evidence for the effectiveness of the product used. Methodological quality for these studies was typically graded as low or very low (see online
 
supplementary materials 
6, table A4
 
for full description of the studies).
Primary outcome: 50% reduction in seizure frequency
Nineteen studies reported the proportion of participants who experienced 50% or greater reductions in seizure frequency. This comprised 2 RCTs
26 28 and 17 observational studies, including 4 open-label trials,
11 31 34 37 3 retrospective chart studies,44 53 54 3 self-report studies,
45 46 49 3 case reports39 43 44 and 4  studies of a general observational design.
12 32 52 55CBD was more likely to produce >50% reduction in seizures than placebo in two RCTs (RR 1.74, 95% 
CI 1.24 to 2.43, n=291 patients, mean age: 25.9 years, range: 10–45 years, I
2=0%; low GRADE rating; see table  
2 and in online supplementary material 7.1, figure A4). We estimated that the NNT for one person to achieve a 50% reduction in seizures was 8 (95% 
CI 6 to 17). Esti- mates did not differ based on epilepsy type, sample age or study risk of bias rating (see online 
supplementary material 7.1, 
figure A5–A7). An estimated 48.5% of the 970 
patients in 17 observa-tional studies achieved a 50% or greater reduction in seizures (95%
 
CI 39.0% to 58.1%, mean 
age: 8.8 years, range: 6 months to 46 years, considerable heterogeneity, I
2=79.5%; low GRADE rating; see table 2, supplementary material 8.1, figure B1). This estimate is comparable to, although larger than the proportion of responders in the two larger, high-quality RCTs (42.6%
26 and 44.2%
28). Estimates did not differ by epilepsy type, sample age or study risk of bias (see online supplementary material 8.1, figures B2–B5). The pooled estimate for paediatric only samples (57.7%, 95% 
CI 39.0% to 75.6%) was somewhat higher than that for adult, or mixed adult and paediatric samples (36.2%, 95% 
CI 11.3% to 64.4%); however, these estimates fell within overlapping bounds of uncertainty (online
 
supplementary mate-rial 8.1.2a, figure B4).As noted in table
 
4, we conclude there is mixed quality evidence that there may be some treatment effect of CBD as an adjunctive therapy in achieving 50% or greater reduction in seizures. There is insufficient evidence from moderate-quality
 
or high-quality studies to assess whether there is a treatment effect of Cannabis sativa, CBD:THC combinations or oral cannabis extracts.
secondary outcome: complete seizure freedom
Seventeen studies reported rates of complete seizure freedom among individuals receiving cannabinoids as adjunctive treatments (see 
table 
2 for full details). This comprised 3 RCTs
25 26 28 and 14 observational studies, including 4 self-report surveys,
9 45 46 49 3 open-label trials,11 31 37 2 retrospective chart reviews,
44 54 2 case studies35 44 and 3 studies of a general obser- vational design.
12 52 55
Of the three RCTs that reported data on complete seizure freedom, one study involved only paediatric patients with Dravet syndrome (n=120),
26 one included both paediatric and adult patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n=171)
28 and one study involved only adult patients with secondary generalised epilepsy (n=15),
25 all of which were classified as drug-resistant. The pooled RR from these studies for CBD in achieving complete seizure freedom compared with placebo was 6.17 (95% CI 1.50 to 25.32, total n=306 participants, mean age: 16.4 years, range: 2.3–45.1 no heterogeneity, I
2=0%; low GRADE rating; see table 
2 and online supplementary material 7.2, figure A8). We estimated that the NNT for one person to achieve complete seizure freedom was 171 (95% CI 155 to 339). There were no differences identified in the RR of complete seizure freedom based on epilepsy type, age group or study risk of bias (see
 
online supplementary material 7.2, figures A9–A11); however, each subgroup only contained one study in these analyses.The pooled prevalence of participants achieving complete seizure freedom in the 14 observational studies with no compar - ison group was 8.5% (95% CI 3.8% to 14.5%, n=944, mean age: 8.1, range 6 months to 46 years, substantial heteroge-neity, I
2=77.3%;  see online  supplementary material 8.2, figure B6, low GR ADE rating). This was higher than the proportion copyright. on November 20, 2019 by guest. Protected by

of participants who achieved complete seizure freedom in the two larger, high-quality RCTs (namely 4.9% and 5.8%). There were no significant differences in the proportion of participants achieving complete seizure freedom by epilepsy type, participant age or risk of bias (see online supplementary material 8.2, figures B7–B10). The pooled estimate for paediatric samples (14.3%, 95%
 
CI 
5.2% to 25.9%) was somewhat higher than that for adult or mixed adult and paediatric samples (4.3%, 95%
 
CI 
1.3% to 8.4%); however, these estimates fell within overlapping bounds of uncertainty (see
 
online
 
supplementary material 8.2.2a, figure B9).As noted in table
 
4, we conclude that there is mixed quality evidence that the use of CBD as an adjunctive treatment may help achieve seizure freedom. There is insufficient evidence to assess whether CBD:THC combinations or oral cannabis extracts are effective.
secondary outcome: quality of life
Fourteen studies (comprising 26 individual data points) eval-uated the effects of cannabinoids on quality of life indicators. T wo were RCTs,
26 28 and 12 were observational studies, of which 4 were retrospective chart reviews,
51–54 4 were case study reports,
35 39 41 43 2 were self-report surveys48 49 and 2 were open- label trials.
12 32 Quality of life in the two RCTs26 28 was measured by parent's/caregiver’s global impression of change. Non-RCTs reported improvements in mood, social skills, cognitive skills, behaviour, alertness/attention, speech and language, sleep, appe-tite and motor skills and reductions in self-stimulation.The pooled RR of parents/caregivers reporting that the patients’ overall condition had improved (using the patient global impression of change measure) in those receiving CBD versus placebo of 1.73 (95%
 
CI 1.33 to 2.26, n=274 patients, mean age: 
12.6 years, range 2.3–45.1, no heterogeneity, I
2=0%; see table
 2, online  supplementary material 7.3, figure A12), and this did not differ on the basis of epilepsy type, sample age or study risk of bias (online supplementary material 7.3, figures A13–A15). The NNT for one person receiving CBD to experi-ence an improvement in parental-reported quality of life was 5 (95% CI 4 to 9).A pooled estimate from observational studies of the propor - tion of patients with improved quality of life when using canna-binoids was 55.8% (95% CI 40.5 to 70.6, n=440 patients, mean age: 12.7 years, range: 6 months to 50 years, considerable hetero-geneity, I
2=93.9; see online  supplementary material 8.3, figure B11). This included improvements in mood (95.9%, 95%  
CI 74.1 to 100), cognitive skills (76.1%, 95% 
CI 53.8 to 93.6), alertness (54.0%, 95% 
CI 28.3% to 78.9%) and sleep (50.9%, 95% 
CI 9.8% to 91.4%; see 
online supplementary figure B11). The proportion of participants reporting improvement in quality of life indicators was higher in samples with Dravet syndrome (100%, 95%
 
CI 
84.3% to 100%) compared with samples with mixed epilepsy syndromes (44.4%, 95%
 
CI 29.6% to 
59.5%); however, the studies comprising the Dravet syndrome subgroup were all case series (combined n=5 patients) in which every patient responded and thus this should be interpreted with great caution (online
 
supplementary material 8.3.1, figure B12). Samples comprising adults only reported higher proportions of participants experiencing improved appetite, mood and sleep (89.3%, 95%
 
CI 75.5% to 98.3%) compared with paediatric samples (30.1%, 95%
 
CI 16.7% to 44.9%; see online
 
supple- mentary material 8.3.2, figure B13). Studies rated as being at ‘serious’ risk of bias (the second highest risk rating) had lower overall proportions of participants reporting improvement in quality of life (16.6%, 95%
 CI 8.4% to 26.3%) compared with studies at ‘critical
 risk’ (the highest rating; 65.2%, 95%
 CI 34.5% to 91.3%) and studies where 
risk was unable to be determined due to lack of information (85.4%, 95%
 CI 67.5% to 98.0%;
 
see online
 
supplementary material 8.3.3, figure B14).As noted in table
 
4, we conclude there is mixed quality evidence that CBD improved patient quality of life when used as an adjunctive treatment. There was very low-quality and low-quality evidence on the use of Cannabis sativa , oral THC, CBD:THC combinations and oral cannabis extracts. This was insufficient to assess their therapeutic usefulness.secondary outcome: study withdrawals
Withdrawals are used as an indicator of tolerability and effec-tiveness of a treatment. T welve studies reported on patient with-drawal from treatment—four RCTs
25–28 and eight observational studies, including two open-label trials,
11 41 three retrospective chart reviews
44 53 54 and three studies of a general observational design.
12 52 55
In RCTs, there was no difference in the likelihood of study withdrawal for any reason between patients given CBD and who received placebo (pooled RR 2.96, 95% 
CI 0.64 to 13.78, n=306 patients; mean age: 16.4 years, range: 2.3–49, moderate heterogeneity, I
2=52.2%; see table  3 , online supplementary material 7.4, figure A16). This did not differ on the basis of epilepsy type, sample age or study risk of bias (see online  supple- mentary material 7.4, figure A17–A19). Based on two RCTs,
26 27 patients receiving CBD were more likely to withdraw from the study due to experiencing AEs (pooled RR 4.87; 95%  
CI 1.10 to 21.68, n=345, mean age: 11.9, range: 2–55 years, no hetero- geneity, I
2=0%; see  online  supplementary material 7.4.4, figure A20), with no difference based on epilepsy type, sample age or study risk of bias  (see online supplementary material 7.4, figures 21–23). The NNH for one person to withdraw from CBD treat-ment due to AEs was 164 (95% CI 140 to 267).A pooled estimate of the proportion of participants with-drawing from the study for any reason in four
11 52 53 55 non-RCTs was 28.0% (95%  
CI 5.2% to 59.5%, n=486, mean age: 8.7, range: 6 months to 32 years, considerable heteroge-neity I
2=98.0%; see table  3 , online supplementary material 8.4, figure B15). All samples comprised a mix of epilepsy subtypes (see online supplementary figure B16). Pooled estimates of with-drawal were higher for paediatric-only samples (47.9%; 95% 
CI 40.9% to 55.0%) compared with mixed paediatric and adult samples (15.2%; 95% 
CI 11.3% to 19.6%; see online supple- mentary material 8.4.1, figure B17). One study rated as crit-ical risk of bias (the highest risk category)
53 had substantially higher proportions of participants reporting study withdrawal (70.6%, 95%  
CI 61.9% to 78.0%) than studies of lesser risk (see 
online 
supplementary material 8.4.2, figure B18). The pooled estimate for withdrawals from the study due to AEs in six studies
11 12 41 53–55 was 4.1% (95%  CI 0.9% to 8.8%, substan-tial heterogeneity, I
2=72.3%, n=521, mean age: 10, range: 6 months to 32 years; see online supplementary material 8.4.3, figure B19), and did not differ based on epilepsy type, sample age or study risk of bias (see online supplementary material 8.4, figures B20–B22).Study withdrawals were noted for patients receiving CBD and oral cannabis extracts (table
 
3
). There is mixed quality evidence, including from two higher-quality RCTs that patients who received CBD were more likely to withdraw from treatment. There is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about withdrawals from oral cannabis extract treatment.copyright. on November 20, 2019 by guest. Protected by

Secondary outcome: AEs
Sixteen studies reported AEs, 4 were RCTs25–28 and 12 were non-RCTs,
11 12 31 32 35 45 48 49 51–54 including 3  self-report surveys,

11 31 1 case study35 and 3  were a general observational design.
12 32 52
A meta-analysis of 516 patients in three RCTs26–28 found that patients who received CBD had a small but significant increase in the risk of experiencing any AE compared with those who received placebo (pooled RR 1.24, 95% 
CI 1.13 to 1.36, mean age: 13.7, range: 2–55 years, no heterogeneity, I
2=0%; see table  
3 , online  supplementary material 7.5, figure A24), with no difference based on epilepsy type, sample age or study risk of bias (see online 
supplementary material 7.5, figures A25– A27). Specific AEs for which participants receiving CBD were at increased risk included drowsiness (RR 2.53, 95% 
CI 1.40 to 4.57), diarr
hoea (RR 2.63, 95%
 
CI 1.45 to 4.76), fatigue (RR 5.80, 95%
 
CI 1.36 to 24.83) and changes in appetite (RR 5.46, 95%
 
CI 2.18 to 13.69; 
see 
 
online
 
supplementary material 7.5.4, figure A28). The NNH for one person receiving CBD to experi-ence any AE was 3 (95%
 
CI 3 to 6).P
ooled estimates of 651 patients in 12 non-RCTs were that 50.6% of patients experienced any AE (95%
 
CI 31.7% to 69.4%, mean age: 12.6, range: 6 months 
to 50 years, consider- able heterogeneity, I
2=94.4%; see online  supplementary mate - rial 8.5, figure B23). This did not differ based on epilepsy type. Mixed paediatric and adult samples had significantly higher proportions of participants reporting any AE (82.8%, 95% 
CI 75.6% to 89.1%) compared with adult-only and paediatric-only studies (see 
online 
supplementary material 8.5.2, figure B25), and studies at critical risk of bias (the highest risk level) had significantly smaller proportions (27.0%, 95%
 
CI 14.2% to 41.9%) than studies at lesser risk (see
 
online
 
supplementary material 8.5.3, figure B26). The most common specific AEs included drowsiness (22.6%, 95%
 
CI 15.3% to 30.7%), ataxia (17.1%, 95%
 
CI 1.1% to 41.7%) and diarr
hoea (11.3%, 95%
 
CI 2.8% to 23.0%; see online
 
supplementary material 8.5.4, figure B27).Three RCTs
26–28 found that patients in the CBD treatment groups were more likely to experience any SAE event than patients in placebo conditions (pooled RR 2.55, 95% 
CI 1.48 to 4.38, n=516, mean age: 14.3, range: 2–55, no heteroge-neity I
2=0.4%,  low GR ADE rating; see online supplementary material 7.6, figure A29), with no difference based on epilepsy type, sample age or study risk of bias (see online supplementary material 7.6, figures A30–A32). Specific SAEs recorded included status epilepticus and elevated aminotransferase levels (see online 
supplementary material 7.6.4, figure A33) The NNH for one person using CBD to experience any SAE was calculated to be 23 (95%
 
CI 18 to 40).P
atients receiving CBD also had increased odds of experi-encing TSAEs (RR 5.93, 95%
 
CI 1.38 to 25.46, n=396, mean age: 15.8, range: 2–55 years, no heterogeneity
, I
2=0%, low GRADE rating; see online  supplementary material 7.6.6, figure A34), with no difference based on epilepsy type, sample age or study risk of bias. The NNH for one person to experience a TSAE was 191 (95% 
CI 167 to 529).In the five non-RCT studies
12 32 33 45 52 with 201 patients, the pooled estimate of patients experiencing any SAE were 2.2% (95% CI 0% to 7.9%, mean age: 9.1 years, range: 6 months to 31 years, moderate heterogeneity, I
2=52.5%, low GRADE rating) (see online supplementary material 8.6, figure B28). The percentage of participants experiencing SAEs did not differ by epilepsy type or sample age; however, studies at critical risk of bias (the highest risk level) had lower rates of SAEs than studies at lesser risk (see online
 supplementary material 
8.6, figure B29– B31). SAEs included pneumonia and thrombophlebitis; however, these were reported in only one study33 (see online  supplemen- tary material 8.6.4, figure B32). Only one observational study reported TSAEs,
11 with 1.1% (95% CI 0.6% to 1.8%) of partic-ipants reporting this outcome (n=162, mean age: 10.5, range: 0.9 to 2.62 years, unimportant heterogeneity, I
2=22.5%, very low GRADE rating). Specific TSAEs included status epilepticus, convulsion, hepatoxicity, pneumonia and death in one case (see online supplementary material 8.6.5, figure B33).There is mixed quality evidence, including from three moder - ate-quality to high-quality RCTs, that patients receiving CBD are more likely to experience mild-to-moderate AEs (see table
 
4
). There is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions on whether patients receiving Cannabis sativa, oral THC and oral cannabis extracts were more likely to experience AEs.
Discussion
We synthesised available evidence on the safety and efficacy of cannabinoids as an adjunctive treatment to conventional AEDs in treating drug-resistant epilepsy. In many cases, there was qual - itative evidence that cannabinoids reduced seizure frequency in some patients, improved other aspects of the patients’ quality of life and were generally well tolerated with mild-to-moderate AEs. We can be much more confident about this statement in the case of children than adults, because the recent, larger, well-con-ducted RCTs were performed in children and adolescents.In studies where there was greater experimental control over the type and dosage of cannabinoid used, there was evidence that adjuvant use of CBD reduced the frequency of seizures, partic-ularly in treatment-resistant children and adolescents, and that patients were more likely to achieve complete seizure freedom. There was a suggestion that the benefits of adding CBD may be greater when patients were also using clobazam.
11 12 However because clobazam and CBD are both metabolised in the cyto-chrome P450 pathway, the pharmacokinetic interactions of these two drugs still need to be fully determined.
56 Further randomised, double-blind studies with a placebo or active control are needed to strengthen this conclusion.Non-RCT evidence was consistent with RCT evidence that suggested cannabinoids may reduce the frequency of seizures. In most of these studies, cannabinoid products and dosages were less well-controlled, and outcomes were based on self-report (often by parents). These studies provide lower quality evidence compared with RCTs due to the potential for selection bias in the study populations, and other weaknesses in study design. There was also some evidence that studies at very high risk of bias had higher reported proportions of participants reporting reductions in seizures and lower proportions reporting AEs. In RCTs, and most of the non-RCTs, cannabinoids were used as an adjunctive therapy rather than as a standalone intervention, so at present there is little evidence to support any recommendation that cannabinoids can be recommended as a replacement for current standard AEDs.
limitations
There are still few well-controlled, randomised and place-bo-controlled studies on CBD in drug-resistant epilepsy.
57 Most studies in this review were observational and used self-report data, raising concerns about possible patient selection and self-reporting bias. This concern especially applies to self-report copyright. on November 20, 2019 by guest. Protected by

surveys of parents, most of whom were self-selected and so may only include the most satisfied users of cannabinoids. They are unlikely to have included patients who had negative experiences or received no benefits from using cannabinoids.The fact that more patients withdrew or experienced AEs when receiving CBD than placebo indicates the need for clini - cians and patients to weigh the risks and benefits of adding CBD to other AED treatment. The most commonly experienced AEs in patients receiving CBD (drowsiness and dizziness) are similar to those reported from approved AEDs such as gabapentin and levetiracetam, and occur at similar rates.
58 59
Small numbers of patients (8%–12%) in two RCTs experi-enced TSAEs.
26 28 Studies are needed to assess whether the rate of these SAEs is similar to that experienced by patients receiving approved AEDs. Incidence rates of SAEs with clobazam, a common epilepsy treatment
60 61 are similar to the profiles of cannabinoid SAEs. If cannabinoids are more effective when combined with clobazam,
11 the possibility of increased rates of SAEs will need to be considered.Safety issues need to be highlighted when discussing the results of poorly controlled studies of cannabinoids in epilepsy. In clinical trials and non-experimental clinical studies, doctors and other healthcare professionals can monitor patients and intervene if they experience AEs. When patients use ‘artisanal’ cannabis products, there is much less control over dosages and purity of the product, and so more variability in dosing. For example, in one study, dosages of CBD reported by parents ranged from 0.5 to 28.6
 mg/kg/day
, and THC dosages ranged from 0 to 0.8
 mg/kg/day
.49 Well-controlled and well-regulated therapeutic trials are essential to specify the doses required to produce therapeutic effects with a minimum of AEs. We iden-tified an additional 10 studies that met inclusion criteria but for which results were not yet posted. As these results become available, we hope to see these included in updated reviews
13 in order to improve recommendations on the use of cannabinoids for treatment-resistant epilepsy.
Conclusions
Few high-quality RCTs have been conducted to date, and those that currently exist have tested CBD in paediatric samples with rare and serious forms of drug-resistant epilepsy. Of these existing studies, a reasonable proportion of patients experienced a decrease in seizure frequency when using pharmaceutical grade CBD prod-ucts in addition to AEDs; however, minor AEs were likely and complete seizure freedom was unlikely. The timely completion and publication of RCTs will provide a better basis for assessing the benefits and risks of cannabinoid products to control epilepsy.

Full report in .pdf format [200KB]  Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in Australia and is used by a wide section
        of the community, particularly younger people. Contrary to data from the early to mid-
        1990s, recent Victorian crash data suggest that the use of cannabis is associated with
        elevated culpability in crashes. It is therefore timely to draw together the international
        literature in regard to the issues around cannabis use and road safety. This report reviews
        the key issues concerning cannabis and road safety, including: patterns of cannabis use; the
        prevalence of cannabis in the driver population, drivers suspected of driving under the
        influence, and drivers killed or injured; effects on simulator and on-road driving; detection
        of cannabis in bodily samples; and measurement of impairment using performance tests
        such as the Standardised Field Sobriety Test. The report highlights the current gaps in
        knowledge and documents the specific areas of research that need to be pursued in future

 Monash Medical Centre is among other Victorian hospitals to participate in the large-scale, multicentre study. A common medical condition, epilepsy affects around 1 per cent of the population. 20-30 per cent of epilepsy patients continue to have seizures despite taking current antiepileptic medications, and ongoing seizures carry a risk of serious injuries, psycho-social and mental health problems and sudden death. “Many centuries ago in China, cannabis was used as a medicinal agent to treat several ailments and in the early 1800s, western medicine started using it as a painkiller,” said Monash University’s Associate Professor Udaya Seneviratne. “More recently, there has been resurgence in interest of the use of cannabis to treat epilepsy, chronic pain, spasticity, and nausea.” “Some studies have highlighted dramatic improvement in seizure control with cannabis, in patients with uncontrolled epilepsy,” said Associate Professor Seneviratne, who is also Monash Health’s leading epileptologist. Cannabis contains over 80 chemical compounds known as cannabinoids. Cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are the most studied chemicals. “THC has psychoactive properties producing a “high”, a property sought by recreational users, however, CBD has medicinal properties, and unlike THC, does not cause addiction,” said Associate Professor Seneviratne. CBD has potent antiepileptic properties demonstrated in animal studies. Its value as an antiepileptic drug to control seizures has been shown in small studies in humans. Associate Professor Seneviratne said patients with focal epilepsy who are still having seizures despite taking standard antiepileptic drugs are being selected to take part in the trial. “At the moment, we do not have sufficient evidence on efficacy and safety of cannabis to recommend it as an antiepileptic agent to treat epilepsy.” “Both the medical community and patients are eagerly waiting for the results of this trial—it will be an important milestone in establishing the place of CBD as an antiepileptic drug, bringing hope to those living with epilepsy.” In Victoria, Monash Medical Centre, Austin Hospital, Royal Melbourne Hospital and St. Vincent’s Hospital are involved in this clinical trial.","Oct 4, 2016 ...

Abstract
Background:  There has been an increased trend towards 
the legalisation of medicinal and recreational cannabis use 
worldwide. This has been controversial as the long-term 
effects of frequent cannabis use on the brain are still poorly 
understood. 
Methods:  In this study, we investigated whether the legal status 
of cannabis in the United States of America (USA) is associated 
with problematic cannabis use and impulsivity in 329 frequent 
cannabis users. The data were collected in 2015 and were 
analysed in 2017. Ethical approval for this study was obtained 
from Monash University in 2015.
Results:  The results indicated  that participants’ problematic 
cannabis use and impulsivity was not different whether they 
resided in states where cannabis is legal for medical and/or 
recreational use or prohibited.Limitations:  The present study is a cross-sectional design, making 
it difficult to infer causality and establish whether cannabis use is a 
cause, consequence, or correlate of altered impulsivity. 
Conclusion:  Our study supports the notion that frequent 
cannabis use is associated with impulsive behaviours, whilst, 
conversely, we did not find an association between US state 
legalisation and problematic cannabis use or impulsivity. 
Keywords:  impulsivity, legal status of cannabis in the USA,

Introduction
Following the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs in 1961, 
recreational cannabis use was banned and its possession 
became criminalised.1 Thereafter, cannabis-related crimes – 
including use and possession – increased dramatically in 
the USA and Europe, particularly amongst young people.1 A 
decade later, concerns were raised regarding the detrimental 
effects of criminal records on young people.2 Consequently, 
some US states decriminalised cannabis use in the 1970s and 
replaced imprisonment with fines.2 To date, across the USA, 
cannabis has been legalised by 29 states for medical use and 
8 states for both recreational and medical use. Yet, evidence 
suggests an association between frequent cannabis use and 
dependence, cognitive impairment, and vulnerability to 
psychotic illness.3 Further evidence suggests that adolescent cannabis users are at a greater risk for adverse outcomes, 
including persistent cognitive impairment and increased risk 
of psychotic symptoms.4 A primary public health concern has 
been to establish whether the legalisation of cannabis is likely 
to increase use amongst youth with concomitant negative 
consequences. Studies show mixed results; some have found 
higher rates of cannabis use in states that have legalised 
medicinal use,5 whereas others have found no difference after 
law enactment in the USA.6 MacCoun7 compared cannabis use 
in the USA and Netherlands after the legalisation of cannabis 
and found that cannabis use amongst students aged 15–16 
years was higher in the USA. Other countries in the EU that 
have not legalised cannabis either matched or exceeded the 
rate of students’ cannabis use in the Netherlands.7 These 
studies suggest that legalising cannabis for recreational and/
or medical purposes does not necessarily lead to an increase  ORIGINAL RESEARCH – Legalisation status of cannabis and problematic cannabis use and impulsivity in the USAdrugsincontext.com

ISSN: 1740-4398in cannabis use. Other studies show that cannabis use affects 
regulatory networks of the brain and is associated with 
impulsivity.8 For example, it was demonstrated that cannabis 
increased impulsivity immediately after administration9; 
changes in impulsivity due to cannabis consumption may 
interfere with individuals’ self-regulation, leading to risky 
or problematic behaviours.10 As the cannabis landscape 
evolves and governments are increasingly turning towards 
legalisation, the public health concerns around cannabis use 
warrant further research. In the present study, we investigated 
whether there was an association between legalisation status 
and either problematic cannabis use or impulsivity in frequent 
cannabis users and whether the legal status of cannabis in 
the USA moderates the association between impulsivity and 
problematic use. 
Methods
Ethical approval for this study was obtained from Monash 
University Human Research Ethics Committee (project number: 
CF15/1235 – 2015000576). 329 frequent cannabis users were 
recruited online via the Amazon Mechanical Turk ( https://
www.mturk.com/ ) in 2015, and gave informed consent prior 
to commencing the questionnaire. All participants were 
US residents and frequent cannabis use was defined as 
having used cannabis once or more per week for the past 12 
months (mean consumption: 3.93, s.d.: 2.34 times per week). 
Participants indicated that they had no history of diagnosed 
alcohol or other illicit substance disorders and that they had 
not used illicit substances other than cannabis once a month or 
more across the past 12 months. The sample consisted of 196 
males and 133 females. The majority were Caucasian (82%)  
(see Table 1 for descriptive statistics.)The Cannabis Use Problems Identification Test (CUPIT) was used 
to assess problematic cannabis use. It is a 16-item self-report 
scale with two subscales: ‘Impaired Control’ over cannabis use 
and ‘Problems’ caused by or as a consequence of cannabis 
use.11 About 95% of participants met criteria for being at risk 
of developing a cannabis use disorder, as indicated by scores 
above 12. About 73% of participants met criteria for cannabis 
use disorder as indicated by scores above 20.11 The Barratt 
Impulsiveness Scale was used to assess how often individuals 
perform different behaviours. US state legalisation status was 
obtained in 2015, and individuals were classified into two 
groups: states where cannabis use was legal for recreational 
and/or medical purposes (n=158) and states where cannabis 
was prohibited (n=171) (see Figure 1).
The association between legalisation status and problematic 
cannabis use (i.e. ‘Impaired Control’ and ‘Problems’) and 
impulsivity were examined using a series of one-way analyses 
of variance (ANOVA). To examine whether the relationship 
between impulsivity and problematic cannabis use was 
moderated by legalisation status, we used multiple regressions. 
Problematic cannabis use was regressed on impulsivity, 
legalisation status, the interaction between impulsivity and 
legalisation status, and a vector of control variables (age, gender, 
and ethnicity [defined by ‘Caucasian’ or ‘other’]). Statistical 
analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 23.
Results
A series of ANOVA found no association between state 
legalisation status and CUPIT ‘Impaired Control’ subscale, CUPIT 
‘Problems’ subscale, or impulsivity (see Figure 2). The three 
ANOVA analyses were replicated using a subset of the sample 
that comprised only the 73% of individuals who met criteria for a Figure 1. Legalisation status of cannabis use in the USA in 2015.

cannabis use disorder; however, again there was no association 
between state legalisation status and any of the three outcome 
variables. Two linear multiple regression models (Table 2) 
were then used to examine whether the relationship between 
impulsivity and problematic cannabis use was moderated 
by legalisation status. Specifically, these models regressed the outcome variables (i.e. ‘Impaired Control’ and ‘Problems’) 
on impulsivity, legalisation status, the interaction between 
impulsivity and legalisation status, and a vector of control 
variables. These models were found to explain 8% and 17% of 
the variance in problematic cannabis use when using ‘Impaired 
Control’ and ‘Problems’ subscales as the dependent variables, 
respectively. Results from the regression models found that after 
adjustment, impulsivity predicted ‘Impaired Control’ ( β=0.24, 
p=0.001) as well as ‘Problems’ ( β=0.34, p<0.001). However, the 
interaction between impulsivity and legalisation status was 
not significant in both models suggesting that the relationship 
between impulsivity and problematic cannabis use was not 
different depending on legalisation status. 
Discussion
These data indicate that there is a positive association between 
problematic cannabis use and impulsivity in frequent cannabis 
users. This finding is in accord with other studies showing 
an association between problematic cannabis use and 
impulsivity.9 A strong body of research shows that cannabis use 
is linked with impulsivity, and studies suggest that impulsivity 
is an important factor related to the early stages of addiction 
processes, such as drug experimentation.10 Our results also 
show that legalisation status in the USA is not associated with 
problematic cannabis use and impulsivity. The current findings 
go beyond prior studies to suggest that, at this point in time, 
the legalisation status of cannabis has not shown an association 
with cannabis use amongst frequent users, a finding supported 
by a growing body of literature.6 Although the detrimental 
health effects of frequent cannabis use are well established,3 
our findings suggest that legalisation status does not worsen 
these effects. It is too early to conclude that the legal status  ORIGINAL RESEARCH – Legalisation status of cannabis and problematic cannabis use and impulsivity in the USAdrugsincontext.com

ISSN: 1740-4398are common in frequent cannabis users.12,13 Notwithstanding, all 
participants were informed that their responses would remain 
anonymous and confidential, encouraging genuine responses. 
Furthermore, studies have reported that using self-reports are 
relatively valid tools to measure cannabis use, even compared to 
more objective measures such as urine tests.14,15 Nonetheless, it 
should be noted that we cannot exclude the influence of biases 
on the accuracy of this study’s results.
Conclusion
Despite the above limitations, our study supports the notion 
that frequent cannabis use is associated with impulsive 
behaviours, whilst, conversely, we did not find an association 
between US state legalisation and problematic cannabis use 
or impulsivity. These findings contribute to the debate related 
to the benefits of legalising cannabis use and contribute to 
the debate over the link between problematic cannabis use 
and state legalisation status as well as impulsive behaviours.of cannabis in the USA has had no effects on problematic 
cannabis use or cannabis-related harms, especially in states 
with liberal definitions of cannabis use.2 
Limitations of the study
Our study has several limitations. First, it uses cross-sectional 
data, making it difficult to infer causality and establish whether 
cannabis use is a cause, consequence, or correlate of altered 
impulsivity. Future research would benefit from a longitudinal 
design to track over the long term whether there is an association 
between legalisation status of cannabis and problem use and 
impulsivity. A second limitation is the small sample size, which 
restricted our ability to investigate those using cannabis for 
recreational purposes only compared with both recreational and 
medical purposes. A third limitation is the recruitment design 
that relied on online self-report data, which may lead to biases. 
For instance, participants may not have reported their cannabis 
use or impulsivity accurately due to memory impairments, which

  Two of Monash University's outstanding journalism scholars have been named finalists in the prestigious Walkley Student of the Year award. Christiane Barro, who won last year’s Walkley for Student of the Year, was nominated again for the coveted award and Monash undergraduate journalism student Selby Stewart achived one of three finalist nominations. The other finalist included Dylan Crawford and Lilly McKenzie from Griffith University. And Monash Master of Journalism student Amber Schultz has been nominated for the prestigious Jacoby-Walkley Scholarship. If successful, Amber’s Jacoby-Walkley scholarship includes a 10-week placement at the Nine Network in Sydney and a four-week placement at the Walkley Foundation, leading in to the 63rd Walkley Awards for Excellence in Journalism. Walkley finalists here Christiane, who recently graduated from her Monash bachelor’s degree, now works as an investigative reporter for The New Daily in Melbourne. She was recognised for the following stories: “The cannabis oil ‘healers’ preying on Australia’s sick and dying” “Contaminants detected in unlicensed cannabis oil products” “‘It’s a disgrace’: Senator requests complete overhaul of medicinal cannabis regulator”. “I am thankful to the sources who trusted me with their story and for the guidance I received from Monash University, especially Corinna Hente, and The New Daily,” Christiane said. “These stories would not be possible without the aid of the research facility that agreed to test the different cannabis oils that were sourced by sick Australians from unlicensed suppliers.” Selby Stewart has produced outstanding work for the Sunday Herald Sun and Mojo News, which included the following stories: “Hoods on violent rampage”, “Rooming-house closures not the answer, experts say” and “Fred Negro's St Kilda”. Selby was humbled to become a student Walkley finalist. “I am very humbled and excited and a little surprised as well. I'm also proud because I have put a lot of work into my study and my development as a journalist,” Selby said. “And for that hard work to be recognised is just a great feeling.” Selby said he enjoyed the human element of journalism and “getting a glimpse into someone else’s life”. “I would love to work overseas, travel around the world and, as long as I am meeting new people and hearing their stories I will be happy wherever I end up,” he said. “I really believe in the importance of good journalism and I really believe in this industry.” Monash head of journalism Associate Professor Fay Anderson said it was “fantastic news and a great honour” for the students to be recognised for their excellent news writing and production. “I would like to personally congratulate Selby Stewart, Christiane Barro and Amber Schulz on their nominations,” Associate Prof Anderson said. “The nominations are a recognition of our outstanding journalism students at Monash. I would also like to pay tribute to the committed journalism staff who mentor and guide our students throughout their degree.” Mojo News staff editor Corinna Hente has mentored the students as they developed their writing portfolios for the Monash publication. “Christiane is a powerhouse. Her stories on medical cannabis are tremendous pieces of investigative reporting – and even more important and stronger than the work she did to win this same award last year,” Ms Hente said. “Her dedication shows in the consistently high quality of her work.” Ms Hente said Selby was rapidly establishing himself as a young journalist to note, with skills way beyond his years. “Both Christiane and Selby have had key roles in Monash's award-winning student journalism publication, Mojo News, Ms Hente said. “What's particularly impressive for both is their commitment to improving their skills across a range of media and reporting styles.” Amber, who is one of 10 student journalists long-listed for the scholarship, has produced some fine work on Channel 31 TV show, The Struggle, and has also completed a successful internship at The Age newspaper. “The overwhelming support, guidance, and advice from the staff at Monash have really helped me build my portfolio, which ultimately led to the nomination,” Amber said. “Advice for anyone thinking of applying to the scholarship? If you have an idea, don't hold back – put your all into it, and keep working until you develop something you're overwhelmingly proud of.” The awards will be announced at a function in Sydney on Wednesday, July 18.

The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review to determine the opioid-sparing potential of cannabinoids. Eligiblestudies included pre-clinical and clinical studies for which the outcome was either analgesia or opioid dose requirements. Clinical studiesincluded controlled studies and case series. We searched Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Medline, and Embase.Nineteen pre-clinical and nine clinical studies met the search criteria. Seventeen of the 19 pre-clinical studies provided evidence ofsynergistic effects from opioid and cannabinoid co-administration. Our meta-analysis of pre-clinical studies indicated that the medianeffective dose (ED
50) of morphine administered in combination with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC) is 3.6 times lower(95% confidence interval (CI) 1.95, 6.76; n=6) than the ED
50of morphine alone. In addition, the ED 50for codeine administered in combination with delta-9-THC was 9.5 times lower (95% CI 1.6, 57.5, n=2) than the ED
50of codeine alone. One case series (n=3) provided very-low-quality evidence of a reduction in opioid requirements with cannabinoid co-administration. Larger controlled clinicalstudies showed some clinical benefits of cannabinoids; however, opioid dose changes were rarely reported and mixed findings wereobserved for analgesia. In summary, pre-clinical studies provide robust evidence of the opioid-sparing effect of cannabinoids, whereas oneof the nine clinical studies identified provided very-low-quality evidence of such an effect. Prospective high-quality-controlled clinical tria ls are required to determine the opioid-sparing effect of cannabinoids.Neuropsychopharmacology(2017)42,1752–1765; doi:10.1038/npp.2017.51; published online 5 April 2017/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12
INTRODUCTION
Chronic pain is associated with enormous personal, social,and economic burden and is the largest contributor to yearslived with disability globally (Riceet al, 2015). Despite this,existing medications provide only modest relief. Opioids inparticular have considerable side effects, including constipa-tion, impaired sleep, and respiratory depression (Chou et al, 2015). The last two decades have seen an increase in theprescription of opioids, which has been associated with anincrease in opioid use disorders and opioid-related mortality(Chouet al, 2015; Volkow and McLellan, 2016; Zedleret al, 2014). This has been termed as an‘opioid crisis’, and hascaused regulators, health professionals, and the public tobegin seeking means to reduce problems associated withhigh-dose opioid use. Consequently, there is a need forevidence-based strategies for reducing reliance on high-doseopioids without compromising pain management.Using combinations of medications to harness comple-mentary but distinct mechanisms of action can maximize theanalgesic response, enabling the use of a lower dose of eachmedication and resulting in an improved side effect profile.One promising area for medication combinations is the useof opioid-sparing medications. Opioid-sparing medications,when co-administered with opioids, enable a reduced opioiddose without loss of analgesic efficacy. Cannabinoidmedications are increasingly being studied for their analge-sic- and opioid-sparing potential. The endocannabinoidsystem represents an ideal target because it is a keyendogenous system in modulating pain-processing pathways(Woodhamset al, 2015).The endocannabinoid system is composed of the canna-binoid CB1 and CB2 receptors, the endocannabinoid ligands

CB1 and CB2receptors are differentially expressed on the central nervoussystem (Cencioniet al, 2010; Herkenhamet al, 1991) and play important roles in pain processes. Both cannabinoidreceptors and endocannabinoids are present in the primaryafferent pain circuits to the brain (Manzanares et al, 1999; Woodhamset al, 2015). Cannabinoid and opioid receptorshave similar signal transduction systems (Cichewicz, 2004;Howlettet al, 2002; Viganoet al, 2005) and are expressed inseveral brain regions involved in antinociception, includingthe periaqueductal gray, raphe nuclei, and central-medialthalamic nuclei (Cichewicz, 2004). In addition, mu-opioidreceptors and CB1 receptors co-localize in the spinal cord atthe first synaptic contact for peripheral nociceptive afferentneurons (Hohmannet al, 1999; Salioet al, 2001).It has previously been observed that CB2 receptorsindirectly stimulate opioid receptors located in primaryafferent pathways (Ibrahimet al, 2005). Therefore, inaddition to their direct analgesic effects, cannabinoids maywork synergistically to enhance opioid analgesia. Thebehavioral, anatomical, and biochemical similarities betweenopioid and cannabinoid receptor systems and their endo-genous ligands are well documented. For example, activationof either cannabinoid or opioid receptors produces compar-able neurobehavioral and physiological effects, includingantinociception (Manzanareset al, 1999). This is highlightedby both CB1 and CB2 agonists being able to induceantinociception by increasing opioid precursors ’gene expression or via release of endogenous opioids (Houseret al, 2000; Ibrahimet al, 2005; Valverdeet al, 2001). Further,pharmacological modulation of the opioid system canmodify the effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC)—a partial agonist at the CB1 and CB2 receptor —on nociception (Masonet al, 1999; Pughet al, 1997; Smithet al, 1994) andvice versa. Finally, cannabinoid antagonists havebeen shown to reverse the antinociception induced bymorphine (da Fonseca Pachecoet al, 2008). Collectively,this strongly supports shared mechanisms between bothsystems in regard to analgesia.Animal models have identified a role for CB1 receptoractivation in reducing neuropathic, visceral, and inflamma-tory pain (Pertwee, 2008; Walkeret al, 1999). Several pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that systemic administra-tion of cannabinoid receptor ligands produces analgesia inacute and chronic pain models (Walker and Huang, 2002).In addition, the role of CB2 receptors has been explored inpre-clinical studies, suggesting that these receptors maymediate effects in inflammatory pain states (Ibrahim et al, 2006; Quartilhoet al, 2003), and reduce inflammation andneuropathic pain (Guiet al, 2015).Further to these pre-clinical findings, clinical studiesindicate that cannabinoid administration may reduce painand improve other symptoms such as sleep disturbancesassociated with chronic pain (Wareet al, 2010a; Wareet al, 2010b). This effect could be mediated by delta-9-THC, whichis the main psychoactive ingredient present in cannabis(Cichewicz, 2004; Jensenet al, 2015). Despite the growingbody of relevant literature, to date no systematic review has
focused on the opioid-sparing effects of cannabinoids. Toaddress this gap, we conducted a systematic review of pre-clinical and clinical studies to examine the strength ofexisting evidence demonstrating the opioid-sparing effect ofcannabinoids in the context of analgesia.MATERIALS AND METHODSSearch
We conducted a systematic search of the literature inaccordance with recommendations by the Preferred Report-ing Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses(PRISMA) (Moheret al, 2009). The search aimed to identifyclinical and pre-clinical studies using the following electronicdatabases: Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Re-views, Medline, and Embase. Search terms are listed and asample search strategy is reported in SupplementaryAppendix 1. No date limits were included. Searches wererun on 29 October 2015. In addition, reference lists fromidentified studies and review articles were searched to findadditional studies not identified by the main search.Eligible studies included:/C15Human or animal studies./C15Outcomes of either pain/analgesia or opioid requirements/opioid-sparing effects from concurrently administeredopioids and cannabinoids./C15Controlled clinical studies and case series.Titles were screened by two authors (SN and PS). Whereinconsistencies were identified, the authors were able toreach consensus on each occasion.
Data Extraction and Outcomes
Data extraction forms were developed and circulated to theauthor group before piloting and refining. All data wereextracted by one of the authors (SN, PS, or JMT) andchecked by a second author (SN, PS, or JMT). These sameauthors reviewed and resolved any inconsistencies, withinput from the authorship group as required. When requireddata were missing, attempts were made to contact authors ofpublished reports to collect additional information.
Outcome Measures
For pre-clinical studies, the primary outcome was the dose ofopioid required to give an equivalent antinociceptive effect inthe presence and absence of cannabinoids. For clinicalstudies, the primary outcome was evidence of the opioid-sparing effect of cannabinoids. Data were extracted on opioiddose and/or analgesic outcome where cannabinoids wereco-administered. Secondary outcome measures examinedincluded analgesia, sleep, and quality of life.
AnalysisPre-clinical studies
. Data were extracted and a narrativereview was conducted. Ten studies were identified assufficiently similar in design and outcome measures to beeligible for meta-analysis. Of these, six reported sufficientdata to enable meta-analysis; that is, the dose of opioidrequired to produce comparable analgesia in the presenceand absence of cannabinoids, the variance of the observeddose, and the sample size. Authors of the other studies wereOpioid-sparing effect of cannabinoidsS Nielsenet al
1753
Neuropsychopharmacology contacted in an attempt to include additional studies in the
meta-analysis; however, no additional data were identified to
enable the inclusion of any additional studies.
To prepare the data for the meta-analysis, the effective
dose (ED 50) and either confidence limits or SE were
extracted from the relevant literature. ED 50is calculated on
the log 10scale. Therefore, to meet the assumption of
normality, the log10cED50must be used in the meta-
analysis. The log 10of the confidence limits must also be
determined to calculate the SD of the log10cED50:
SD log10cED50/C16/C17
¼log10UL/C0log10cED50
1:96;
where UL is the upper confidence limit.
When only SE was reported, the confidence limits were
calculated using the method of Litchfield and Wilcoxon
(1949) and the above procedure was repeated to calculate
the SD. This method also allowed for the inclusion of studies
that did not report exact sample sizes for all treatment
groups, as sample size was not required for the calculation
of SD.
Data for the meta-analysis were analyzed using Review
Manager 5.1 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). When
calculating the continuous outcome of an equally effective
opioid dose (eg, the log 10ED50for morphine when adminis-
tered alone vswhen administered with a cannabinoid), the
inverse variance statistical method and random effects model
were used to compensate for study heterogeneity.No statistical difference was found in outcomes between
the studies that used different species or nociceptive assays.
Therefore, the mean difference of log10ED50of and the
corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calcu-
lated. Due to the nature of log calculations, the mean
difference —when back-transformed to the original units —
represents the response ratio. For easier interpretation, we
present the reciprocal of the response rate.
Assessment of bias in pre-clinical studies . A funnel plot
was produced to examine publication bias and small study
effects in the pre-clinical studies included in the meta-
analysis.
Clinical studies . The nine clinical studies identified were
heterogeneous in design and outcomes, and therefore
not suitable for meta-analysis. Thus, a narrative synthesis
was conducted instead, with all studies scored for quality
using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Devel-
opment and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria (Guyatt et al ,
2008).
RESULTS
The initial searches identified 3019 records after duplicates
were removed, with 19 pre-clinical and nine clinical studies
identified for inclusion in the final review (see Figure 1 for

Neuropsychopharmacology Summary of Pre-Clinical Studies
Nineteen pre-clinical studies were identified in which the
analgesic effect of opioid and cannabinoid co-administration
was examined (Cichewicz et al, 1999, 2005; Cichewicz and
McCarthy, 2003; Cox et al, 2007; Finn et al, 2004; Katsuyama
et al, 2013; Li et al, 2008; Maguire et al, 2013; Pugh Jr et al,
1996; Reche et al, 1996; Smith et al, 1998, 2007; Tham et al,
2005; Wakley and Craft, 2011; Welch and Stevens, 1992;
Williams et al, 2006, 2008; Wilson et al, 2008; Yesilyurt et al,
2003) (Table 1). Fourteen of these studies examined delta-9-
THC, whereas one to two studies examined each of 10
other cannabinoid agonists, including beta-caryophyllene,
CP 55 940, CP 56 667, delta-8-THC, 11-hydroxy-delta-9-
THC, dextronantradol, levonantradol, WIN 55, 212-2, and
HU-210. Seventeen studies examined morphine, three
studies examined codeine, and one to two studies examined
buprenorphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, morphine, hydromor-
phone, methadone, LAAM, meperidine, and pentazocine.
Most of the studies used rodents; however, two used rhesus
monkeys and one used guinea pigs. The most common
antinociceptive assays were tail-flick tests ( n=10) and hot
plate tests ( n=5), although individual studies also used other
forms of mechanical, thermal, and chemical nociception.
Most studies (17 of the 19) demonstrated that combining a
cannabinoid with an opioid resulted in a synergistic effect on
analgesia compared to the analgesic effects of the individual
drugs. One study examined a single dose of morphine and
demonstrated that morphine could potentiate the analgesic
effect of intrathecally administered delta-9-THC (Reche et al,
1996). However, this study could not demonstrate an opioid-
sparing effect due to the use of a single dose of opioid.
Another study found that 2 mg/kg morphine administered
with 1 mg/kg delta-9-THC resulted in a significant effect on
nociception compared to morphine alone ( po005), but not
when compared to delta-9-THC alone (Finn et al, 2004). In
another study, a greater increase in hot plate latency was
found for morphine combined with HU-210 (38.9 s ±1.1 s)
compared with HU-210 alone (33.1 s ±4.0 s) (Wilson et al,
2008); however, this difference did not reach significance.
One study testing multiple opioid agonists identified clear
synergistic effects for delta-9-THC for most opioid drugs,
with the exception of fentanyl and pentazocine (Cichewicz
et al, 1999). The potency ratio when administered alone for
those opioids found to have a synergistic effect, compared to
when those same opioids were co-administered with delta-9-
THC varied between 2.2 and 25.8. Another study testedmultiple cannabinoid agonists when co-administered with
morphine and demonstrated a synergistic effect with delta-9-
THC, delta-8-THC, levonantradol, and 11-hydroxy-delta-9-
THC; additive effects with CP 55 940 and CP 56 667; and no
observable potentiation of morphine effects with dextronan-
tradol, which is an isomer of levonantradol (Welch and
Stevens, 1992). In contrast to the finding of an additive effect
for CP 55 940, two other studies of CP 55 940 in combina-
tions with morphine demonstrated a synergistic analgesic
effect (Maguire et al, 2013; Tham et al, 2005). In addition
to changes in the magnitude of the analgesic effect, two
studies showed that the duration of the analgesic effect
can be extended by administrating a low-dose opioid
and cannabinoid in combination, compared with adminis-
trating an opioid alone (Williams et al, 2006; Yesilyurt et al,
2003).
Meta-Analysis of Pre-Clinical Studies
Six studies used sufficiently similar approaches to enable a
meta-analysis (Cichewicz et al, 1999; Cichewicz and Welch,
2003; Cox et al, 2007; Smith et al, 1998; Welch and Stevens,
1992; Williams et al, 2008) (Figure 2). A further four studies
were comparable in study design, but did not contain the
required data (ED 50or variance on estimates) to enable
meta-analysis (Finn et al, 2004; Pugh Jr et al, 1996; Smith
et al, 2007; Williams et al, 2006). All studies included in the
meta-analysis used rodents and reported comparable anti-
nociceptive doses of morphine alone and morphine co-
administered with delta-9-THC. Results from the meta-
analysis are reported in terms of mean difference.
The meta-analysis identified a significant opioid-sparing
effect with morphine and delta-9-THC co-administration,
Z=5.59, po0.001 (MD in log 10ED50–0.56 ( –0.83, –0.29)).
As there was significant heterogeneity in the data ( I2=95%),
a random effects model was used. When back-transformed
to the original units, the response ratio was 3.6 (95% CI 1.95,
6.76), indicating that the median ED 50of morphine
was 3.6 times lower when given in combination with delta-
9-THC compared to when morphine was administered
alone.
Two studies compared doses of codeine with and
without delta-9-THC in rodents (Cichewicz et al , 1999;
Cichewicz and Welch, 2003) (Figure 3). Both studies used
male ICR mice and the tail-flick assay. Meta-analysis of these
data indicated a significant opioid-sparing effect of delta-9-
THC when co-administered with codeine, Z=2.49, p=0.01

Neuropsychopharmacology (MD in the log 10ED50–0.98 ( –1.76, –0.21)). Significant
heterogeneity in the data ( I2=98%) necessitated the use of a
random effects model. When back-transformed to the
original units, the response ratio was 9.5 (95% CI 1.6,
57.5), indicating that the ED 50of codeine was 9.5 times lower
when given in combination with delta-9-THC compared to
when codeine was administered alone.
Funnel plots did not provide evidence of publication or
small study bias with these pre-clinical studies (Figure 4).
Results from Clinical Studies
Nine clinical studies with 750 participants provided data
relevant to the research question (Table 2); however, the
heterogeneous nature of the studies precluded meta-analysis.
Three laboratory-based studies examined pain responses in
participants concurrently being administered opioids and
cannabinoids. One study recruited people with mixed
chronic non-cancer pain ( n=24) who were prescribed
opioids (Abrams et al, 2011). A significant reduction in pain
ratings was observed for the participants in this study
following co-administration of cannabinoids —39.6 (95% CI
35.8, 43.3) at baseline vs29.1 (95% CI 25.4, 32.8) following
co-administration (Abrams et al, 2011). It should be noted
that no placebo or control condition was used in this study
for comparison (Abrams et al, 2011).
In another two studies, healthy volunteers ( n=12 and 13,
respectively) participated in crossover studies, with single
doses of placebo, morphine alone, dronabinol alone, and
dronabinol and morphine combined administered over four
sessions (Naef et al, 2003; Roberts et al, 2006). These studies
did not identify a synergistic effect on experimental pain in
healthy controls, although Roberts et al (2006) found that the
co-administration of dronabinol and morphine resulted in a
reduced unpleasantness of pain compared to either drug
alone. In a case series examining the effects of cannabinoid
administration in patients with chronic non-cancer pain,
three patients with mixed pain conditions (multiple sclerosis,
HIV-related peripheral neuropathy, and lower back and leg
pain) reported reductions in opioid requirements after
initiation of smoked cannabis plant material (Lynch and
Clark, 2003).
Five controlled studies were identified. One small, non-
randomized study of patients with advanced cancer pain
found that 5 out of 12 patients achieved pain control
after receiving a cannabis infusion, compared with 2 out of
14 achieving pain control in the control group —a non-
statistically different effect (Lissoni et al , 2014). Two
randomized controlled trials examined delta-9-THC :
Cannabidiol (THC : CBD) combination oral sprayscompared to a placebo (Johnson et al, 2010; Portenoy et al,
2012) in patients with cancer pain who were taking opioids.
These studies found improved analgesia with the THC : CBD
combination compared to the placebo. Johnson et al (2010)
found no effect of THC : CBD on breakthrough opioid dose
requirements. Portenoy et al (2012) conducted a dose-
ranging study, using fixed dose ranges of the THC : CBD
combination. In this study, a significant analgesic effect was
only found in the lowest dose group, with poorer tolerability
observed for higher doses.
Two controlled studies examined the effects of dronabinol:
one in patients with mixed chronic pain (Narang et al, 2008)
and one in patients with prostate cancer (Seeling et al, 2006).
Narang et al (2008) found significantly reduced pain
intensity with the opioid –cannabinoid combination in
double-blinded laboratory sessions compared to opioid
alone. Additional improvements in sleep, energy, and social
functioning were reported in a 4-week open-label phase of
the same study (Narang et al, 2008). In the study by Seeling
et al (2006), perioperative use of dronabinol compared with
a placebo in patients with prostate cancer, no difference
was found in self-administered opioid dose requirements
between groups.
Quality Ratings of Clinical Studies
The clinical studies were rated using the GRADE criteria.
One study provided very-low-quality evidence, three studies
provided low-quality evidence, two studies provided
moderate-quality evidence, and three randomized controlled

1761
Neuropsychopharmacology trials provided high-quality evidence. None of the high-quality studies provided evidence of an opioid-sparing effect.The only study that provided direct evidence of an opioid-sparing effect was rated as providing very low-qualityevidence (Lynch and Clark, 2003).
DISCUSSION
Twenty-eight studies provided data relating to the potentialopioid-sparing effect of cannabinoids in the context of opioidanalgesia. Most of the pre-clinical studies examined reportedreduced opioid requirements when co-administered withcannabinoids. Few controlled clinical studies measuredopioid-sparing as an end point and findings relating toanalgesia were mixed. Two controlled studies found no effectof cannabinoids on opioid dose requirements (Johnson et al, 2010; Seelinget al, 2006). One case series provided verylow-quality evidence of a reduction in opioid dose require-ments with cannabinoid co-administration (Lynch andClark, 2003).Most of the pre-clinical studies examined found synergisticeffects when opioids and cannabinoids were co-adminis-tered, although two studies found that with specific opioidsand cannabinoids the analgesic effect was additive ratherthan synergistic. Through meta-analyses, it was found thatthe doses of morphine and codeine required to produce thesame analgesic effect were 3.6 and 9.5 times lower,respectively, when co-administered with delta-9-THC. Re-ductions in opioid requirements that are smaller than thoseseen in these pre-clinical studies may have relevance to paintreatment. Some confidence in these findings comes from theconsistent observation of an opioid-sparing effect whenusing different nociceptive assays and in pain models ofarthritis and diabetic neuropathy.The relevance of the findings from these pre-clinicalstudies (with acute-dosing paradigms) to clinical chronicpain treatment must be considered. There are importantlimitations in translating findings from pre-clinical studies toclinical practice, particularly when evaluating doses andeffect sizes. Although the outcomes of pre-clinical studies areoften consistent with clinical studies, pre-clinical studies mayover-represent effects. The lesser effect sizes in humanstudies have been attributed to the heterogeneity of clinicalpopulations or the response being limited to sub-popula-tions, reducing the overall effect observed (Berge, 2011). Thisunderscores the importance of clinical studies to examine theeffects found in pre-clinical work.Controlled clinical studies demonstrated some beneficialeffects of opioid and cannabinoid co-administration onoutcomes of pain, sleep, and functioning in chronic painpatients (Abramset al, 2011; Naranget al, 2008). One caseseries (n=3) provided very low-quality evidence of areduction in opioid requirements with delta-9-THC admin-istration. No randomized controlled studies were identifiedthat provided evidence of an opioid-sparing effect ofcannabinoids. Important limitations identified in theseclinical studies included a lack of placebo control (Abramset al, 2011; Lynch and Clark, 2003; Naranget al, 2008), difficulties extrapolating from experimental to clinicalpain (Naefet al, 2003; Robertset al, 2006), use of singledoses (Naefet al, 2003; Robertset al, 2006), use of smallsample sizes (Lissoniet al, 2014; Lynch and Clark, 2003;Naranget al, 2008), and the mixed quality of the studydesign in general. In particular, Robertset al(2006) used sub-therapeutic doses of morphine, which may have limitedthat study’s ability to test the effects of co-administration.Portenoyet al(2012) noted that the use of fixed dose rangesof cannabinoids may have limited that study ’s ability to testthe efficacy of cannabinoids for pain, as some patients mayhave dropped out due to tolerability. Moreover, bydiscouraging patients from reducing their opioid dose duringthe study, no opioid-sparing effect could be observed(Portenoyet al, 2012).This review highlights some important considerations forfuture studies of cannabinoids. A dose-ranging study withpatients with advanced cancer found that only lower doses ofcannabinoids demonstrated analgesic effects (Portenoy et al, 2012). In the same study, one in four participants in thehigh-dose group discontinued treatment. Side effects such asnausea, drowsiness, and dizziness are more frequent withhigher doses of cannabinoids (Naranget al, 2008; Portenoyet al, 2012). This suggests that dose range and tolerability areimportant outcomes to examine and that careful dosetitration is essential. Future studies should carefully docu-ment adverse effects from concurrent opioid and cannabi-noid administration to provide a better understanding ofpotential harms. One hypothesis to explain why patientsreduce their opioid dose with cannabinoid administration is
that they experience undesirable psychoactive effects fromconcurrent use of opioids and cannabinoids. This could beexplored in future studies.Recent observational studies provided further data on apossible opioid-sparing effect. Two studies found 44 –64% reductions in self-reported opioid consumption in cohorts ofpatients with chronic pain who were using cannabis(Boehnkeet al, 2016; Haroutounianet al, 2016). Theseobservational studies provide further low-quality evidencesupporting an opioid-sparing effect. A further observationalstudy found that in patients with chronic pain who wereprescribed opioids, greater pain relief was reported fromcannabis than from their other medications (Degenhardtet al, 2015). A single case study also reported reducedrequirements for breakthrough pain with oral delta-9-THCadministration (Holdcroftet al, 1997). Taken together, thesereports support the need for high-quality studies to directlyassess the opioid-sparing effect of cannabinoids undercontrolled conditions.This review identified some limitations in the literature.The pre-clinical studies examined used a range of animalpopulations, antinociceptive assays, opioids, and cannabi-noids, and often had small numbers of animals per group.This resulted in statistical heterogeneity. Despite this, a largeand significant effect was observed in the meta-analysis. Nostudies examined the opioid-sparing effect of cannabidiolalone, in combination with delta-9-THC outside of a 1 : 1ratio, or with other cannabinoids. Further, the lack of high-quality studies in humans investigating the opioid-sparingeffect means that the evidence for this is largely limitedto pre-clinical studies. A funnel plot was produced and didnot provide evidence of publication or small study bias;however, due to the small number of studies in the meta-analysis (o10) the interpretation of the funnel plot islimited.Opioid-sparing effect of cannabinoidsS Nielsenet al
1762
Neuropsychopharmacology The potential for cannabinoids to reduce opioid doserequirements and extend the duration of effective analgesiashould not be understated. The rapid increase in opioid useand opioid-associated mortality is largely attributed useof opioids in chronic pain treatment (Chou et al,2 0 1 5 ; Zedleret al, 2014). Use of lower opioid doses has beenrecommended (Dowellet al, 2016); however, clinical processesto achieve this reduction are not well defined. Opioid-sparingmedications may have enormous clinical relevance byenabling effective pain treatment with lower opioid dosesand a potential reduction in opioid-related mortality.In conclusion, pre-clinical studies support the opioid-sparing effect of delta-9-THC. However, the findings fromclinical trials are inconsistent, with some studies found tohave important limitations such as a lack of placebo control.An opioid-sparing effect of cannabinoids in chronic painpatients was observed in only one very-low-quality clinicalstudy. These findings provide an early signal that warrantsexploration. It remains to be seen if these promising pre-clinical and observational findings can be replicated in large,well-designed clinical studies.

I really appreciate Dr Christine Grove and Professor Dan Lubman from Turning Point joining us this morning. Thank you very much for your submission as well; the committee has copies of that. I welcome you to make some opening remarks and then we will move into a committee dis cussion and questions. Thank you.  Prof. LUBMAN: Thank you so much. I would just like to start by thanking the  committee for allowing us to present today. It is a real privilege. I would also like to sta rt by paying our respects to the traditional custodians of the land on which we stand and pay our respects to and ackno wledge leaders both past, present and emerging. I would also like to introduce my esteemed colleague at Monash University, Dr Christine Grove, who is an expert in the mental health and wellbeing of children and adolescents. In terms of an opening statement, I would like to start by sayi ng that the past decade has seen an unprecedented shift in cannabis policy worldwide. Canada and Uruguay became the first two countries to legalise the sale and use of cannabis for recreational purposes at a national level. In the US cannabis is legal for medicinal use in 33 states, while 11 have expanded their policies to legalise us e for recreational purposes. It is early days, but so 
far such changes in public policy do not seem to have led to an  increase in cannabis use or increase in harms; however, further monitoring is obviously needed. It is also imp ortant to note that the move towards more liberal policies globally is mirrored by a shift in Australian public thinking towards viewing drug use as a health and human rights issue, with 78 per cent of Australians in the last national drug household survey believing cannabis possession should not be a criminal offence and an increase in public support for cannabis legalisation, with 41 per cent of Australians supporting that. Importantly, studies have consistently shown that decriminalisation does not increase drug use among existing or new drug users and it reduces demand on and the cost of the criminal justice system. So given these changes globally, it is critical that we continue to reflect on our current policy approaches to cannabis, and we welcome th e opportunity to address the inquiry. As documented in our submission, we highlight the critical impo rtance of how we educate our children about drugs, especially given the changes in public opinion on cannab is and the global change in cannabis policy, with clear evidence that we must adopt a strength-based and socially inclusive approach to ensure young people  Wednesday, 21 April 2021 Legislative Council Legal and Social I ssues Committee 2 
 
 develop critical health literacy and build their help-seeking skills. We also note the importance of ensuring any public health campaign avoids fear-based strategies and does not reinforce stigma and discrimination as this can further delay help-seeking support. We also recommend that the assessment and treatment of cannabis and other drug use disorders need to be embedded as core competenci es in undergraduate and postgraduate training at all levels of health practitioner training, with opportunities for hands-on training placements within addiction settings. As highlighted in our submission and in keeping with the recommendations of the royal commission into mental health, this will require significant investment in clinical, academic and specialist addiction roles, which have been neglected since deinstitutionalisation. Finally, it is important to recognise the most significant harm s from cannabis come from the risk of contact with the criminal justice system. More than 70 000 people are a rrested for cannabis offences each year. More than 90 per cent of these are for possession. Current cannabis policy undeniably causes harm, but particularly for adolescent and young adults, who can experience long-lasting and disproportionate harms from the criminal justice system, particularly if they acquire a criminal record due to a minor cannabis offence. Given the significant harms associated with the current drug policy, there is increasing recognition globally that a new approach is needed. We are happy to talk to our submission and welcome any questions that the committee has.  The CHAIR: Thank you very much, Dan. Christine, would you like to make a ny opening remarks?  Dr GROVE: No, that is fine. Thanks very much. Open to the committee now .  The CHAIR: Thank you. We will open it up for questions—we have got until  10.40. Tien, would you like to open up the questions?  Dr KIEU: Thank you, Chair. Thank you, Professor Lubman and Dr Grove, for your appearance today here and your submission. I have a quick question. You mentioned abo ut legalisation. In my mind there may be two different things: one is decriminalisation and the other one legalisation. There may be a small distinction where the supplier of drugs like cannabis or some other harmful subst ance are still being not legal and the other one is the possession of small quantities. So could you confirm which position you think would be best suited for this inquiry recommendation? And the second thing is, you talk about  some of the harmful effects. I just want to drill directly into the driving behaviour of people under the e ffect of cannabis use. At the moment we have, as you mentioned, 70 000 people being arrested every year and 90 p er cent of them are in the category of possessing a very small personal use amount, but what are the effects particularly on the public roads? Thank you.  Prof. LUBMAN: Look, thanks so much for your question. It is a really great question. I think the decision around decriminalisation or legalisation is really ultimately a decision for government and supported by public opinion, and I think what we are trying to present here is the 
evidence around what is happening globally and what we know currently about the impact of those positions in t erms of impacts on the population and what is best for public policy. As you correctly say, most of the chang es we see here in Australia, to date, have really been around decriminalisation, so decriminalising in one form o r another. And I think there is overwhelming public support, as I said in my opening remarks, but also support from governments around the harmful impact of seeing particularly personal use of cannabis as a criminal issue and the long-term impact that has. So I think the evidence is overwhelming that decriminalisation has a lot of evidence supporting that. I think the devil in the detail around decriminalisation is how that happens. A number of states in Australia have fully decriminalised and just have civil penalties. For many of the other jurisdictions, including obviously Victoria, although the police and other lawmakers are encouraged to adopt diversion programs, so a sort of de facto decriminalisation approach, we know that that approach  can be interpreted by different law enforcement officers in different ways and there are certain rules around that in terms of how that diversion is actually applied in real practice. And we know part of the chal lenges with that approach is one of net widening. So there is some really good evidence around how, when we instr uct people to take a diversion approach, it actually encourages looking for other types of crimes in indivi duals than possession charges and can actually lead to greater harms. We also note that it is applied differentially around different backgrounds so that some particular populations are more heavily targeted around that diversion option. It is clear from the evidence that a decriminalisation approach for so many reasons is the most evidence-based way to approach this issue. In terms of legalisation, I think w e just cannot ignore what is happening around the world and what that means in terms of our public policy within Australia, and we need to be mindful of what is  Wednesday, 21 April 2021 Legislative Council Legal and Social I ssues Committee 3 
 
 happening and what that means, particularly—and my colleague Dr  Grove will talk about this—it is very confusing for young people to be told in different parts of the  world that cannabis is legal and that it is widely promoted as a legal substance and yet to then be instructed in a certain way around its harms within an Australian context. It is a very confusing message for young people. I think one of the things we have seen recently, and to the credit of young people, if we look at legal drugs like alcohol and tobacco, where we have really clear information to young people about the health harms and we really focus on giving them really critical understanding of wh at those drugs are, what the impacts are and how to have good choices, we are actually seeing a massive reduction in the age of first onset and the amount of use and prevalence of use amongst young people around tobacco and alcohol. So it seems that we should be taking on lessons for how we approach this issue for those substances with young people, and I think there are lessons there for how we might think about cannabis.  The CHAIR: Thank you. Christine, we have got limited time, but if you did have a couple of comments—I know Dan mentioned that you might have.  Dr GROVE: Yes, thank you, Fiona. I will try and keep it brief, but Dan has given a fantastic overview there about the difference between the two areas. Particularly for young people it is very confusing just even around Australia. We are looking now at trials where we are actually using medical marijuana to support severe mental illnesses within Australia that are rolling out currently therapeutically. For young people when you are in a class that is talking about this use and being criminalised, it is really confusing about the decisions to make and where to go for accurate information around drug and alcohol use and also cannabis use specifically.  The CHAIR: Great. Thank you. We will tease that out a bit further in a minute. Kaushaliya.  Ms VAGHELA: Thanks, Chair, and thanks, Professor Lubman and Dr Grove, for  your presentation today. My question is related to the impact of use of cannabis on driv ers’ ability to drive safely. So the question is: does it impair a driver’s ability to drive safely and does it pose a risk for road safety?  Prof. LUBMAN: Again a fantastic question. Thanks for your question. I think  the issue here is about the question of impairment. Just to be clear, this is not my area of expertise, in terms of drug-related driving. I think you might be speaking to some other individuals who are much more expert in this space. But really we are talking about impairment, and certainly when we are looking at current road rules and we are particularly looking at alcohol, really what we are looking for is the impac t of alcohol intoxication and impairment on 
driving. I think the challenge here is that we know that cannabis has a very long half-life. It gets absorbed into fat. It stays in the system a long time. One of the challenges, I think, for law enforcement is that a reading of cannabis in the system suggests that there is cannabis available in the body, but it does not necessarily really relate to impairment because it can still be there several days after the acute effects of the compound are no longer in the system. So there are some challenges there I think in terms of how law enforcement looks at the issue of detection of cannabis impairment. That is really a challenge fo r our law enforcement system and our scientists: to identify the best way to identify that. But we certainly have that issue currently with a whole range o f other prescribed medications. We know that acute opiate use impacts on driving, but we know there are many people in our community who are on long-term opioids for a whole range of medical conditions and who become tolerant of those effects and are able to successfully drive with those medications in their system. So we need to be very careful around the difference between detecting a substance in our system and recognising the level of impairment, and I think that is something that we need to think about carefully in terms of how we approach that issue.  Ms VAGHELA: And just a quick one, saying that, have you got any agencies in mind? Where can we get the data from for us to be absolutely sure, if it is in the sys tem what sort of impact it does have when the driver is on the road. Do you suggest any names of agencies from where  we can get the data?  Prof. LUBMAN: I am not sure if you have consulted yet, but Professor Ed Ogd en does a lot of work in the vehicle traffic space, and I think he is on the board of one of the international bodies. They have got overwhelming evidence around the questions you ask in this space, and I really encourage you to speak to him and I am sure his networks.

  Ms VAGHELA: Thank you.  The CHAIR: Thank you. Kaushaliya, just as an update, we have had a task force into this issue for medicinal cannabis patients, and that report is sitting on the minister’s desk as we speak. David.  Mr LIMBRICK: Thank you, Chair, and thank you, Dr Grove and Professor Lubma n, for appearing today and for your submission. We have heard from some other witnesses. You spoke about different places both in the United States and other countries that have undergone legalisation, and what we have heard is that there is sort of this spectrum of legalisation. We have heard that in some states in the US they have had a relatively sort of free market approach and there were some concerns about the commercialisation in those markets, but we have also heard that in some other markets like Canada and some  of the US states they have had heavy regulations and taxes and they have had some concerns about peo ple being able to participate in those markets and also some of the organised crime still exists because it is cheaper for them to produce. I would be interested in your thoughts on that spectrum and the pros and cons of thos e different sorts of models and where you think the place is that might have done it best.  Prof. LUBMAN: Okay. Thank you for the question—a very important question in  this space. I think there are a couple of things to say in the space. I think legalisation is not a binary choice. It is not about having it available or not available. As you just so beautifully spoke ab out, there are a whole range of different issues that need to be thought through. I am not sure if you have read the work of Beau Kilmer from the RAND corporation. I can certainly give you the information on that. But he talks very eloquently about the different policy models and the impact that has on health, safety and social equity. I think one of the great things that is happening worldwide is that there is a natural experiment going  on in other people’s countries that we should be really paying attention to and learning from, because I thin k there are all these different natural experiments going on around legalisation that can tell us a lot around what is and what is not working. I am not sure if you are aware of Beau Kilmer’s work, but he ta lks about the 14 Ps of legalisation or the things to think about, and that is things like issues to do with produ ction, issues to do with profit motives, issues to do with the power to regulate, promotion, prevention, policing and  enforcement, penalties, prior criminal records, product types, potency, purity, price, permanency and preferenc es for licences. So a really comprehensive list that I think needs to be really thought through, and you really need, as you say, to talk to colleagues in other jurisdictions that have gone through this to really think through if this were to be considered in a Victorian context, what are the pros and cons and what are the models tha t actually work best?  Mr LIMBRICK: Thank you.  The CHAIR: Thank you. Georgie Crozier.  Ms CROZIER: Thank you very much, Professor Lubman and Dr Grove, for your presentation. Could I just 
get, before I ask my question, some clarity around those arrest  figures. I think you said 70 000. Was that Australia-wide or was that Victoria?  Prof. LUBMAN: That is Australia-wide.  Ms CROZIER: So what are the Victorian figures? Have you got those?  Prof. LUBMAN: I have not got them to hand, but I can certainly chase them f or you.  Ms CROZIER: I think that would be helpful in the context of this inquiry,  if you would not mind.  The CHAIR: I think we have got some in some of the other presentations. Pennington Institute’s submission has those figures, Georgie.  Ms CROZIER: Right. Okay. I think it is important, though, because 70 000 sounds a lot for Victoria, so thank you for that clarity. I am really interested in what you just said. There is a natural experiment going on in the world, and I am very concerned about some of the points that you raise in your submi ssion, going to the points about the longstanding association between cannabis use and psychoses, especially with young people, because we know that cannabis is a different form. It is a different make-up. I t is a lot stronger in 2021 than perhaps the cannabis of 30 to 40 years ago. So I am interested in your comments arou nd that, especially for young people, and I am  Wednesday, 21 April 2021 Legislative Council Legal and Social I ssues Committee 5 
 
 very concerned. This committee has heard from international wit nesses who have spoken about the thousands and thousands of medical reports written on the harms of cannab is use. And so, in the context of what you said, the natural experiment going on in the world, shouldn’t we just  sit back and pause and wait and see those findings in relation to those very harmful effects of cannabis use that you described with the psychoses in young people and, frankly, anyone?  Prof. LUBMAN: Again, thank you for those really important questions to sort  of really untangle that. Let me just start with a couple of them. As you say, I think there is really clear evidence of a link between cannabis and psychosis. I think the evidence there is really clear around early onset use in young people. And the evidence really is, rather than the development of psychosis in people, in terms of what we know about those people who develop it, certainly much more about unmasking an underlying vulnerability to psychosis. We really need to pay attention to that, and we need to make sure,  like we do with all our illicit drugs, that we have protections in place to make sure that young people who are vulnerable do not have access at that young age, as a teenager. It is critically important that we have really good regulation around that. But as you know, when we look at all the national surveys, cannabis is incredibly easy t o get. At the moment we are in this position where, yes, we are very concerned about vulnerable young people, but at the same time they can easily purchase it down the street without much impediment, and that is certainly something that we need to think about in terms of how we protect those young people. The second thing to say in that space is that one of the challenges we have at the moment is doing these natural experiments around young people who start taking cannabis. And there is more work now, and work that we have done as well, that has shown that many of the young people  who develop problems with cannabis already are vulnerable in many other ways. They are choosing to start and have problems with cannabis because of other underlying issues that they have in terms of mental healt h, in terms of issues of underlying trauma and issues of social inequity. We had a paper many years ago now where we were following a longitudinal study following young people and looking at their brain development. It showed that the young people who are most likely to actually experiment with and then use cannabis regula rly were those people who had already had impairments in parts of their brain in the frontal cortex relat ed to other issues in their lives. So we need to be aware that some of the—  Ms CROZIER: Sorry to interrupt. What sorts of other issues are impacting them? I think most young people as they are developing have vulnerabilities of some sort —I am generalising here. But I am interested to understand what you are speaking about in terms of those vulnerabilities.  Prof. LUBMAN: I mean, I think it is really clear from the research evidence that young people who start using and develop a problem with drugs of any description, including cannabis, during adolescence almost certainly have underlying issues, particularly to do with child
hood trauma, to do with unresolved mental health issues and to do with issues around significant social disadvantage. There is really clear evidence from the research literature around how those issues lead young people to rely on drugs to cope with those issues in their lives. I suppose it just speaks to—and Christine can talk about  this—how through a whole range of other government initiatives we need to make sure that we recognise and support young people and identify those most vulnerable and provide early intervention programs to support those young individuals.  Ms CROZIER: Have I got any more time, Fiona?  The CHAIR: No. Sorry, Georgie. But Christine, did you have something to add on to that?  Dr GROVE: Just to add to that, in response to Georgie, when we look at the brain of a young person who has got particular vulnerabilities or experienced trauma in the ir life, their brain is very different to someone who has not experienced trauma in their life, so their brain actually develops completely differently. If we look at scans of those brains, they actually are developing differently to a typical young person or teenager, so that already is a risk factor to using cannabis and they are more li kely to engage with that in the community. If we do not address these issues at all and we leave it at the status quo, it might be a natural experiment really, but actually we have got a lot of evidence to support regulating as  well as decriminalising cannabis use as well. I do not think the best solution is to just leave it and let everything keep going as it is. We do need to address some of these really complex issues head on and put some recommendations forward to school systems, teachers, educators and healthcare professionals about what to do at the moment to go forward from here.

  The CHAIR: Thank you. We are getting short of time, so I will move to Ti m Quilty. Also, Sheena, I hope to get to you, but we are just playing with time. Tim.  Mr QUILTY: Is there any evidence that decriminalisation or legalisation has led to any increase in rates of schizophrenia in susceptible individuals?  Prof. LUBMAN: Again, that is a really great question. At the moment I think  one of the positives that we are seeing in what we have seen globally is there has not been an increase in the rate of psychosis and schizophrenia in the population, and that reinforces the idea t hat those people who smoke cannabis and develop schizophrenia are already people who are vulnerable in some way. So it is not creating schizophrenia in people who would not have that genetic predisposition. I think that speaks to the issue that schizophrenia is a very rare condition. It is a very damaging condition but it is a very rare condition. We know in Australia and around the world cannabis is heavily used by the population, and we have not seen, particularly with legalisation and decriminalisation, an increasing rate of psychosis globally.  The CHAIR: Thank you, Tim. Sheena.  Ms WATT: Thank you so much, Chair. And thank you to you both for your submission today. Having read your submission, you discuss the comorbidity of cannabis use di sorder with other mental health problems and the barriers to access, with the separation of AOD services from mental health services. Recently the Royal Commission into Victoria’s Mental Health System made several recommendations about enhancing the integration of AOD services and mental health services. Of course I note that you made this submission before the final report came out. Have you had an opportunity to consi der that recommendation, and if so, do you think that that will improve the treatment received by young people who need it?  Prof. LUBMAN: Again, thank you for the question. Look, we were absolutely delighted with the recommendations of the royal commission. I think it shines a light on areas that are critically important. We really welcome the recommendations around integration. I think one of the things to say, though, is that the purview of the royal commission was wholly on the mental health  system, and while it has made some recommendations around integration, its remit was not to look a t the alcohol and drug system. I suppose our concerns remain. This is the opportunity I think for the royal commission, but while we all look at the redesign of the mental health system I suppose one of our concerns is that that will not see an increase in the necessary support and functioning around the alcohol and drug system and the necessary investment in terms of providing specialist support in that system. So yes, we are very hopeful the system will change, but for a s uccessful integrated mental health system there needs to be investment in the alcohol and drug system and in evidence-based programs that can inreach into schools. As you see in our submission, evidence-based programs within schools around helping young people to critically think about drug use and programs and promoting h elp seeking—that is an area that I think the 
committee would be helpful to review, because certainly if we are looking at any changes in this space, we need to think about how to make sure that we improve the tremendous delay in help seeking that we see around drug use disorders, including cannabis, because of the shame, stigma  and discrimination we see around this topic.  Ms WATT: Thank you so much.  The CHAIR: Thank you. I think following on from that a little bit, in lo oking at that education—and, Christine, you touched on the difficulty because of the differe nt messages around cannabis where we have got a medicinal cannabis regime, where probably Hollywood is showing a legal cannabis culture in the US and then we have got various forms of criminalisation in Australia—I am just wondering if you can maybe tease out a bit more those conflicting, I guess, stories that young people are seeing and how we can better inform them.  Dr GROVE: Absolutely. Thanks, Fiona. A great question, and I think the questions from the committee today show the tensions in the field right now. And we are adul ts having an adult conversation about best use and what we can do going forward. Imagine a classroom of young people trying to grapple with this information. It is illegal to go and use it and to investigate maybe talking to your school about it, and schools have to report about usage as well, so a young person in that s ituation is most likely to go to social media, Tumblr, a blog, to get information about cannabis use. It is li kely to be inaccurate and provide them with unhelpful information about use.  Wednesday, 21 April 2021 Legislative Council Legal and Social I ssues Committee 7 
 
 And often we do see the current approach, which is quite a blanket prohibition, like, ‘Don’t use it. It’ll cause mental illness’, is not helpful, and we know young people are not responding well to those kinds of messages. So using a bit more of a strengths-based approach that actually  asks young people to be critical, inquire into their own submissions around using any kind of cannabis or, if it is in their life, what to do. It puts them in a position where they actually can get information that is accurate. And if we do not address some of these issues, they are more likely to get unhelpful information that is incorrect and will cause more harm down the track. So a holistic approach would be actually accurately teaching so me of these issues and tensions around drug use and cannabis use and knowing that the fear-based approach is not effective and we do need to actually provide accurate, correct information around what is happening in the world, what is happening in Australia and then in Victoria. We do know in certain areas that there is more likely  to be more use, as well, and so maybe targeting some at-risk communities can be really helpful too.  The CHAIR: Thank you. And just following on from that, because in the ho usehold drug survey in some of the additional information or commentary within that survey rep ort I think they said somewhere between 84 and 88 per cent of cannabis users would be classified as low risk. Would that be something that you would concur with? And certainly going on from your submission, where  you are calling for a lot more education and training in the AOD sector around cannabis, but also trying to have that honest conversation that for most people who use cannabis in Victoria and in Australia it would be in that low-risk classification.  Dr GROVE: Absolutely. Absolutely, Fiona. And what we see is perpetuated stigma around use, and we only hear the sort of traditional risk approach, and that is wh at we are hearing a lot more now. We need to change that conversation to develop health literacy around thes e conversations, and having accurate, correct information about this use is much more beneficial. Saying thin gs like ‘Don’t smoke cannabis, you’ll be a criminal and get a mental illness’ is not helpful and is not in  line with best evidence-based practices and education for young people. Even unpacking young people’s risks and how that is different is on a continuum. It is not black or white, yes or no. The impact that it has definitely depends on the young person, their community and their experience as well. Dan, did you want to add to that? I think you will have some things as well.  Prof. LUBMAN: Yes. Look, thanks for the question, and I completely agree. I  mean, the issue is similar to the issue we have with licit drugs. If we just looked at alcoho l and we just looked at gambling, at addictive behaviours, there is no way in the world that if we just focuse d on those harms that we would in any way legalise those substances. Yet they are part of Australian culture, and we know that many people across government are very supportive of gambling and alcohol as impor tant industries because many Australians enjoy them, and I think the same is true of cannabis. We know t hat cannabis, although it is not legal, is widely used across the community. Many people are using it in the way that they use alcohol or gamble. They use it in 
very low levels, and it is important to understand that we need  to have—at the moment for those people who do develop problems, we do not have really great mechanisms in place to support them. We do not have mechanisms in place to provide the best quality treatment, and we do not have early intervention strategies that help them get the support that they can. So I completely agree with the point you have made, but also, to speak to Georgie’s point as well, we need to make sure we have the best quality treatment and prevention systems in place to provide support for the people who are most vulnerable.  The CHAIR: Thank you both. We have finished at a beautiful spot. I think  that was a great way to finish it, and we are right on time. So thank you both, Christine and Dan, and Turning Point in general, for the work that you are doing and the submission you have provided. As I mentioned, you will receive a transcript of this session, and I would encourage you to have a look at it just to ensure we have not made any errors. Witnesses withdrew.   ","Apr 21, 2021 ...

2021 Annual Report YEAR IN REVIEW
I am pleased to present the 2021 Annual Report for the Monash University Accident Research Centre, which outlines the broad and extensive achievement of the Centre over the year. For MUARC, 2021 was a year of changes and challenges. Despite these, the Centre has continued to deliver on its core mission of excellence and impact in injury prevention research.
For our Director, Professor Judith Charlton, 2021 was truly a landmark year. After an extensive period of well-earned leave, from May until the end of the year, Professor Charlton announced she would step down as MUARC Director and as an employee of the University. Professor Charlton joined MUARC as a Senior Research Fellow in 2000 and served as MUARC Director from 2015. Her contribution to her field of research is immense with over 200 publications with a particular focus on safe mobility of older drivers and child passengers including the international Ozcandrive Older Driver Cohort Study. She has also supervised over 20 PhD, Masters and honours graduates in road safety research. As Director of MUARC since 2015, Professor Charlton’s leadership has positioned the Centre to continue to uphold its reputation as a leader in injury prevention research. In particular, she played a major role in strengthening MUARC’s integration within the broader University and fostered many fruitful collaborations. In recognition of Professor Charlton’s many fine career achievements, she was awarded an AM in the General Division of the Order of Australia in the 2021 Queen’s Birthday honours. On behalf of all in MUARC who have benefited from Professor Charlton’s leadership, we offer our heartfelt thanks and gratitude. We are pleased to announce that Professor Charlton will continue to be involved in the work of MUARC through her new role as Emeritus Professor. There were some other notable staff movements in 2021. After nearly 15 years of service as MUARC’s Chief Operating Officer, Mr Ron Smith announced his retirement. Mr Dudley McArdle who for many years has played a pivotal role in the Monash Disaster Resilience Initiative proudly hosted by MUARC also retired. We wish them both the best for the next stage of their lives and thank them for their significant contribution to MUARC. We also celebrated the milestone achieved by Ms Voula Stathakis of reaching 25 years of service at MUARC.An exciting change to the structure of MUARC was the formalisation of the Centre’s professional education activities into a defined portfolio and the creation of the position of Associate Director, Professional Education. Dr Carlyn Muir is the inaugural appointment to the new position. For many years, MUARC has delivered successful short courses in areas such as Road Safety Leadership. The creation of the new portfolio provides the resources to significantly expand MUARC’s professional education activities in line with the increasing focus of the University in this area. In a close working partnership with the University’s Centre for Professional Education, MUARC has transformed its professional education activities into certified offerings with rigorous pedagogical frameworks. Under this new portfolio, MUARC delivered the first iteration of its new Graduate Certificate of Road Safety to a group of 70 enthusiastic students supported by Commonwealth funded places. This was one of the highest subscribed courses of its type across the University. With the addition of professional education to its existing research and higher degree student portfolios, MUARC is now in a unique position to offer end to end service of research, to research translation to impact.Although continuing to face difficulties in working conditions created by the global pandemic and Victoria’s extensive lockdowns, MUARC has continued to excel in meeting its core  objectives, a testament to the dedication, adaptability and continued  hard work of all staff members.

Abstract
Background: The growing concern about cannabis use, the most commonly used illicit drug worldwide, has led to a
significant increase in the number of human studies using neuroimaging techniques to determine the effect of cannabis on
brain structure and function. We conducted a systematic review to assess the evidence of the impact of chronic cannabis
use on brain structure and function in adults and adolescents.
Methods: Papers published until August 2012 were included from EMBASE, Medline, PubMed and LILACS databases
following a comprehensive search strategy and pre-determined set of criteria for article selection. Only neuroimaging
studies involving chronic cannabis users with a matched control group were considered.
Results: One hundred and forty-two studies were identified, of which 43 met the established criteria. Eight studies were in
adolescent population. Neuroimaging studies provide evidence of morphological brain alterations in both population
groups, particularly in the medial temporal and frontal cortices, as well as the cerebellum. These effects may be related to
the amount of cannabis exposure. Functional neuroimaging studies suggest different patterns of resting global and brain
activity during the performance of several cognitive tasks both in adolescents and adults, which may indicate compensatory
effects in response to chronic cannabis exposure.
Limitations: However, the results pointed out methodological limitations of the work conducted to date and considerable
heterogeneity in the findings.
Conclusion:Chroniccannabisusemayalterbrainstructureandfunctioninadultandadolescentpopulation.Further
studies should consider the use of convergent methodology, prospective large samples involving adolescent to adulthood
subjects, and data-sharing initiatives.

Introduction
Cannabis is the illicit drug most widely available and used
worldwide [1,2], consumed by between 125 and 203 million
people, largely younger age group (15–34 years), which corre-
sponds to an annual prevalence rate of 2.8%–4.5% [1,2]. Despite
the fact that many individuals tend to discontinue cannabis use
after their initial experimentation with the drug [1] and thepercentage of individuals who develop dependence is lower than
that associated with alcohol (15%) or tobacco (32%) use, around
9% of cannabis users develop dependence in the long term [3,4].
Cannabis use has been associated with a range of acute and
chronic mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression,
neurocognitive alterations and deficits as well as increased risk of
psychotic symptoms and disorders, the severity of these effects
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e55821  being dependent on frequency of use, age of onset and geneticvulnerability [5–15]. These effects are probably related to effectson the endocannabinoid system, which can modulate the neuronalactivity of other neurotransmitter systems, such as dopamine,through its action on the most abundant cannabinoid receptor inbrain, the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) [16,17]. CB1 receptorsmature slowly, reaching maximal levels during adolescence [18],and are particularly concentrated in brain regions that are criticalfor executive functioning, reward processing and memory, such asthe prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, basal ganglia,medial temporal areas (e.g., hippocampus and amygdala) andcerebellum [19].Animal studies have consistently demonstrated that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive componentof cannabis [20], is able to disrupt the regulatory role of theendogenous cannabinoid system [21], inducing neurotoxicchanges in brain regions rich with cannabinoid receptors thatmight dramatically affect the process of maturational refinement ofcortical neuronal networks [22–24] and lastly promote changes inbrain structure and alter emotional and cognitive performance[25], particularly if the exposure has been during the adolescentperiod [26,27]. In contrast to animal literature, results fromhuman studies investigating chronic cannabis users are ofteninconsistent. These discrepancies may be due to heterogeneity insocio-demographic characteristics of the population studied,imaging techniques employed, as well as differences in drug usagepatterns and psychiatric comorbidities that may not always beapparent or result in contact with mental health services and hencemay not be appropriately controlled for in studies whereparticipants are screened for presence of co-morbid psychiatricdisorder merely by enquiring about previous contact with mentalhealth services [28–30]. However, overall the results suggest thatlong-term cannabis use may result in persistent alterations in brainfunction and morphology that would extend beyond the period ofintoxication [28,31], and that earlier onset of use may beassociated with greater detrimental effects [32,33].It is remarkable to note that although the onset of cannabis useis typically during adolescence, a few imaging studies have beenconducted with adolescent users [28,34]. Since brain developmentcontinues up to young adulthood [35], adolescence may be acritical period during which chronic cannabis exposure may havefar-reaching consequences [36]. Although brain size is thought tostabilize around the age of five years [37], important neurodevel-opmental processes continue throughout adolescence, includingmyelinization [38], synaptic refinement [39] and gray mattervolume reduction [40]. While the long-term effects of cannabis usemay potentially have major implications for social and family life,education and occupational functioning, its effects on brainstructure and function have not been well determined.The growing concern about cannabis use has led to a significantincrease in the number of human studies using neuroimagingtechniques to determine the effect of the substance on brainstructure and function, as well as to several recent reviewsexamining this topic [28,29,34,41–46]. However, some authorshave only reviewed studies investigating the acute effects ofcannabis [45,46] or those published over the last decade [41,44],while others did not adequately specify criteria for selecting studies[41,43] or included those studies that investigated only adultpopulation [29,42]. In the present review, we have conducted asystematic literature search to assess and integrate the evidence ofthe impact of chronic cannabis use on brain structure andfunction, focusing on studies in the adolescent and adultpopulation. Papers published until August 2012 have beenincluded following a comprehensive search strategy and pre-determined set of criteria for article selection [29].
Methods
Data for this systematic review was collected with an advanceddocument protocol in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines[47]. This protocol provided a checklist for reporting systematicreviews (see Table S1).
Search strategy
Electronic searches were performed using EMBASE (1980-August 2012), Medline (1966-August 2012), PubMed (1966-August 2012) and LILACS (1982-August 2012) databases. Thefollowing key words were used: cannabis; marijuana; marihuana;delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol; THC; cannabidiol, CBD; neuroim-aging; brain imaging; computerized tomography, CT; magneticresonance, MRI; single photon emission tomography, SPECT;functional magnetic resonance, fMRI; positron emission tomog-raphy, PET; diffusion tensor MRI, DTI-MRI; spectroscopy,MRS. All the studies published up to August 2012 were includedwithout language restriction.
Selection criteria
A general review of all neuroimaging studies investigating brainstructure or function was initially performed. We obtained a totalof 142 published papers (Figure 1). Studies were included orexcluded if they expressly stated the following criteria. Inclusioncriteria were: (i) use of structural or functional neuroimagingtechniques involving chronic cannabis users; (ii) inclusion of acontrol group of healthy volunteers matched by age, gender andhandedness; and (iii) users had to be abstinent for at least 12 hoursbefore brain scanning. Exclusion criteria were: (i) non-neuroim-aging studies of cannabis use; (ii) neuroimaging studies thatinvolved participants who had other neurological or psychiatricdisorders, or individuals who met criteria for alcohol dependenceor other substance use disorders (abuse or dependence) differentfrom cannabis and nicotine, or participants who were notabstinent or who tested positive for drugs other than cannabison urine screening test; and (iii) neuroimaging studies withrecreational or naı¨ve cannabis users.We defined chronic cannabis users as persons who usedcannabis several times a week and who had done so for at leasttwo years. Recreational (or occasional) cannabis users weredefined as persons who had used cannabis sporadically (less thanfour times a month), and naı¨ve users or healthy controls werepersons who had used cannabis less than 15 times in their lifetime,according to standardized strict criteria [29,48].Any publication that reported data using two differentneuroimaging techniques from the same subjects (e.g., structuralMRI and functional MRI) or a study examining the same subjectswith two different cognitive tasks (e.g., verbal working memoryand visual attention task) was considered as two studies in thisreview.
Data extraction
Data was independently extracted by two reviewers. In case ofdisagreement, opinion from a third senior researcher was sought toassess whether study criteria were fulfilled. From the articlesincluded we recorded names of authors, year of publication, socio-demographic (e.g., sample size, gender, age, handedness) andcannabis use characteristics (e.g., duration, age of onset, frequencyof cannabis use), imaging type and design, exclusion criteria (forneurological, psychiatric or drug history), confirmation of absti-Neuroimaging Studies in Chronic Cannabis Users

Withregard to alcohol use, we assessed if subjects met criteria foralcohol abuse or for excessive alcohol consumption (more than 21or 14 standard alcohol units per week for males or females,respectively) based on the reported data. For structural andfunctional imaging data, the primary measures of interest wereglobal and regional volume, and global and regional activity[cerebral blood flow (CBF), regional CBF (rCBF) or blood oxygenlevel dependent signal BOLD)]. The secondary outcome was itscorrelation with clinical variables. We collected the statisticallysignificant results of each outcome variable, and recorded whethera multiple comparison correction was done to prevent biastowards false positives.

Of the 142 studies identified, thirty-six did not meet the a priori selection criteria [33,49–84] and sixty-two met the exclusioncriteria [6,12,30,48,85–141] or were case/series reports [142] (formore detailed information, see Figure 1). The remaining 43 studieswere classified according to the neuroimaging technique used(structural/functional), age of the participants [adolescents (#18 years) and adults (.18 years] and testing conditions (resting state/cognitive task) (Figure 1). The studies included comprised: 14structural neuroimaging studies [11 in adult users and 3 inadolescent users; 10 volumetric studies and 4 diffusion tensorimaging studies (DTI)] and 29 functional neuroimaging studies onthe chronic effects of cannabis (24 in adult users and 5 inadolescent users; 8 in the resting state and 21 during a cognitivetask).
1. Structural neuroimaging studies in adult chroniccannabis users
We identified 11 structural MRI studies that examined adultchronic cannabis users and met our selection criteria (Table 1).Structural differences were obtained in seven of them in terms ofglobal brain measures [143] or gray/white matter changes [144–149]. Four studies did not find any significant structural alterationswhen comparing chronic cannabis users with healthy controls[150–153]. The abstinence period for all participants before theyunderwent the structural MRI was between 12 and 24 hours,apart from two studies [145,152] (for details see Table 1).
1.1. Volumetric studies. Of the seven studies comparingglobal brain volume measures between chronic cannabis users andhealthy controls, there was only one study reporting significantdifferences [143], namely reduced ventricular cerebral spinal fluid(CSF) in cannabis users. Another study [145] reported total brainvolume difference between groups which was no longer significantwhen the authors covaried for confounding factors such aspremorbid intelligence.Among the six studies employing a whole-brain analysisapproach [143,146,148,150–152], two further studies describeddifferences between chronic cannabis users and controls[146,148]. Matochiket al. (2005) [148] found lower grey matterdensity in the right parahippocampus and greater grey matterdensity in the precentral gyrus and right thalamus in cannabisusers, while Cousjinet al. (2011) [146] found a larger anteriorcerebellum in cannabis users. Matochik et al. (2005) [148] also reported differences in white matter density, such as lower densityin the left parietal lobe and higher in parahippocampus, fusiformgyrus, lentiform nucleus and pons.With regard to the three studies that focused on specific regionsof interest, all studies reported bilateral volumetric reductions inthe hippocampus [145,148,149] and one reported volumereductions in the right amygdala [149]. Some studies have alsoreported correlations between regional brain volume measuresand cannabis use parameters, clinical and neuropsychologicalmeasures. For instance, a smaller hippocampal volume has beenrelated to a greater exposure to cannabis [145,146,149], severity ofcannabis dependence [146] and more severe positive psychoticsymptoms [149]. Ashtari et al. (2011) [145] described a positiveassociation between larger hippocampus volumes and higherverbal learning and memory scores in healthy controls but not incannabis users [145]. It is remarkable to note that these findingswere in patients with an average of 6.7 months of abstinence,which appears to support of the idea that cannabis use may causelong-term brain alterations.With respect to other brain regions, Cousijn et al. (2011) [146] reported a negative correlation between amygdala volume and theamount of cannabis use or dependence, while Matochik et al. (2005) [148] found an association between increased white matterdensity in left precentral gyrus and longer duration of cannabisuse.1.2. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies. Four studies have used DTI to examine the integrity of white matter tracts inchronic cannabis users [144,147,150,151], of which half havereported positive results [144,147]. Arnone et al. (2008) [144] found increased mean diffusivity (MD) in the corpus callosumwhile Gruberet al. (2011) [147] found increased MD in the rightgenu as well as reductions in left frontal fractional anisotropy (FA).Gruberet al. (2011) [147] also reported a positive associationbetween left frontal FA and impulsivity scores, and higher FA andlower MD in the frontal lobes being associated with a later age ofinitiation of cannabis use.
2. Structural neuroimaging studies in adolescent chroniccannabis users
Three volumetric studies in adolescent chronic cannabis userswere included, two of which consist of the same sample [154,155].As an exception, these two studies [154,155] were included despiteinvolving participants with symptoms of alcohol dependence giventhe modest number of studies included in this population (fordetails see Table 1). The MRI scans, focused on specific regions ofinterest and were obtained following 28 days of abstinence fromcannabis use. Medinaet al. (2009, 2010) [154,155] reportedsignificantly larger volumes of the inferior posterior vermis, as wellas a marginal group-by-gender interaction in the prefrontal cortex,in which female and male cannabis users demonstrated, respec-tively, larger and smaller prefrontal cortex volumes compared tothe same-gender controls. McQueeny et al. (2011) [156] also described an effect of gender in which female cannabis users butnot males, exhibited a larger right amygdala volume.In terms of correlations, Medina et al. (2010) [155] found thatlarger volumes of the vermis were associated with poorer executivefunctioning while McQueeny et al. (2011) [156] found that largerright amygdala volume was associated with more internalizingsymptoms (e.g., anxiety/depression). Lastly, Medina et al. (2009) [154] also found that increased volume in the prefrontal cortexwas associated with poorer executive functioning among cannabisusers while the opposite pattern was observed in controls,suggesting that female users may be at increased risk forcannabis-induced prefrontal abnormalities.
3. Functional neuroimaging studies in adult chroniccannabis users
3.1. Resting state. We included eight case-control studiescomparing resting rCBF in adult chronic cannabis users and noncannabis using healthy controls (Table 2). The imaging methodsused were as follows: H2
15O-PET [157],133Xe-SPECT [158],
18F-FDG-PET [159], [11C]- raclopride-PET [159–162] and[
18F]FMPEP-d2 [163]. Functional differences between groupswere found in all studies, except for the four [
11C]-raclopride-PET studies [159–162]. Abstinence periods ranged from 12 hours to542 days (for details see Table 2). Block et al. (2000) [157] described reduced bilateral rCBF in the posterior cerebellum andventral prefrontal cortex but also increased rCBF in the anteriorcingulate cortex in cannabis users. Lundqvist et al. (2001) [158] found a trend of lower global CBF in cannabis users, as well asreduced rCBF in the right prefrontal and superior frontal cortex.Sevyet al. (2008) [159] reported lower glucose metabolism in theNeuroimaging Studies in Chronic Cannabis Users

However, there were no significantdifferences between the groups in striatal D2/D3 receptoravailability and no correlation between striatal [
11C]-raclopride- PET binding potential and glucose metabolism [159]. Consistentwith these results, three other [
11C]- raclopride-PET studies [160–162] failed to find any differences between groups in dopamineD2/D3 receptor availability in the striatum as a whole or itfunctional subdivisions. However, while Stokes et al. (2012) [160] also failed to find any association between lifetime frequency ofcannabis use and binding potential values, Albrecht et al. (2012) [161] described a negative correlation with both urine levels ofcannabis metabolites and self-report of recent cannabis consump-tion. Finally, Hirvonen et al. (2011) [163] demonstrated areversible and regionally selective downregulation of CB1receptors. At baseline, current users had approximately 20% lessCB1 receptor density in the neocortex and limbic regions, whichwas negatively correlated with years of cannabis exposure. Afterfour weeks of abstinence from cannabis use, CB1 receptor densityreturned to normal levels in all brain regions, except for thehippocampus [163].
3.2. Cognitive paradigms. We identified 16 studies in adultchronic cannabis users that compared regional activation duringthe performance of a cognitive task with healthy controls (Table 2),four with PET [164–167] and twelve with fMRI [151,152,168–177].
Attention
Changet al. (2006) [169] used fMRI to compare a visual-attention task in current and abstinent cannabis users with healthycontrols. Despite all groups showing normal task performance,both active and abstinent chronic cannabis users demonstrateddecreased activation in the right prefrontal, medial and dorsalparietal cortices and medial cerebellar regions but greateractivation in several smaller regions throughout the frontal,posterior parietal, occipital and cerebellum. An apparent normal-ization of BOLD signal was described in the right prefrontal andmedial cerebellar regions in those with a longer duration ofabstinence. In addition, early age of onset and estimatedcumulative cannabis lifetime exposure were both associated withreduced activation in the right prefrontal cortex and medialcerebellum. More recently, Abdullaev et al. (2010) [168] used two attention tasks [the use generation task and the attention networktask (ANT)] to contrast differences between cannabis users andhealthy controls. Chronic cannabis users showed poorer perfor-mance in the ANT (more errors and longer reaction time), as wellas stronger activation within the right prefrontal cortex in bothtasks and within the parietal cortices in the ANT, which mayindicate a less efficient system for the executive control of attentionduring conflict resolution tasks. Finally, Harding et al. (2012) [171] demonstrated for the first time that long-term heavy cannabis useis associated with increased functional connectivity betweenseveral frontal cortex regions and the occipitoparietal cortex usingthe Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT). No differences inbehavioural performance were evident between groups. Theauthors suggest that their findings may suggest a compensatoryrole for these regions in mitigating the effects of abnormalattentional and visual processing following chronic cannabisexposure [171].
Memory
In a H215O-PET study, Blocket al. (2002) [164] found thatcannabis users performed verbal memory tasks more poorly thancontrols. This was associated with reduced activation in theprefrontal cortex and greater activation in the posterior cerebel-lum, as well as with an absence of lateralization of hippocampalactivity. Consistent with this, Jager et al. (2007) [152] describedattenuated activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex andbilateral (para) hippocampal gyri in cannabis users despite normalperformance in an associative memory task. Finally, in a verbalworking memory task, Jager et al. (2006) [173] found significantlygreater activity in the left superior parietal cortex in the cannabisusing group despite there being no differences in task performance,which may be consistent with the idea of a compensatoryrecruitment effect.Inhibition and impulsivity
Eldrethet al. (2004) [166] and Gruber et al. (2005) [151] studied the degree of inhibitory control during a Stroop task in current(positive THC urine analysis) and abstinent chronic cannabisusers, respectively. Gruber et al. (2005) [151] found lower anteriorcingulate activity and higher mid-cingulate and bilateral dorsolat-eral prefrontal cortex activity in current cannabis users relative tohealthy controls, who demonstrated focal increased activity withinthe right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Consistently, Eldreth et al. (2004) [166] found in abstinent cannabis users a reduced anteriorcingulate activation using H2
15O-PET during the performance ofa modified Stroop test. However, they also reported a reduceddorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation and a greater activation inthe hippocampus bilaterally [166]. Lastly, Hester et al. (2009) [172] administered a go/no-go response inhibition task to activecannabis users to determine inhibitory control and error awarenesscompared with healthy controls. Although control performancewas equivalent between the two groups, cannabis users displayed asignificant deficit in awareness of commission errors, which wasassociated with decreased a activity in the anterior cingulate cortexand right insula, as well as in the bilateral inferior parietal andmiddle frontal regions [172].
Decision-making
Bollaet al. (2005) [165] and Vaidya et al. (2011) [167] using H2
15O-PET, and Wesleyet al. (2011) [177] using fMRI, studiedthe brain activation pattern in chronic cannabis users compared tohealthy controls during the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Bolla et al. (2005) [165] reported dysfunction during the performance of thetask in abstinent cannabis users, demonstrating a lower activationin the right orbitofrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortexand greater activation in the left parietal and cerebellar cortices.The number of joints used per week was positively correlated withactivation in the right parahippocampal gyrus but inverselycorrelated with activation in the right cerebellum and orbitalgyrus. Wesleyet al. (2011) [177] also reported a poorerperformance on the IGT in active cannabis users. However, therewere no differences during the initial strategy development phase,in which cannabis users showed reduced activity in response tolosses in anterior cingulate cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex,precuneus, superior parietal lobe, occipital lobe and cerebellumcompared to controls [177]. Additionally, the functional responseto losses in anterior cingulate, ventromedial and rostral prefrontalcortices was positively correlated with improvement over the taskcourse only in the control group, indicating that cannabis usersmay be less sensitive to negative feedback during the strategydevelopment phase [177]. In contrast, Vaidya et al. (2011) [167] did not find differences on the standard IGT performance betweenactive cannabis users and healthy controls. Nevertheless, cannabisusers performed significantly worse than controls on a variantversion of the same task [178]. Both groups showed increasedactivity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex on both versions of theNeuroimaging Studies in Chronic Cannabis Users
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 11 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e55821 IGT compared to the control task but in contrast to Wesley et al. (2011) [177], cannabis users demonstrated greater activity thancontrols in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex on the standardIGT, as well as in the cerebellum and the anterior insula on bothversions of the IGT [167]. Furthermore, duration of cannabis usewas associated with greater activity in ventromedial prefrontalcortex [167]. Nestoret al. (2010) [175] and van Hell et al. (2010) [176] used fMRI to measure brain activity during reward andanticipation of loss with different versions of a monetary rewardtask. There were no significant behavioural differences betweenthe groups in both studies. Nestor et al. (2010) [175] reported agreater right ventral striatum activity in cannabis users duringreward anticipation, which was significantly correlated with yearsof lifetime cannabis use. In addition, response to loss and lossavoidance outcome notification was related with hypoactivity inleft insula, and in the post hoc analysis comparing loss and wincues with no-outcome cues, right ventral putamen showed greaterBOLD response [175]. Conversely, comparing cannabis users tonon tobacco-smoking controls, van Hell et al. (2010) [176] demonstrated attenuated activity in the nucleus accumbens andcaudate nucleus bilaterally during reward anticipation, as well asleft putamen and right inferior and medial frontal gyrus, superiorfrontal gyrus bilaterally and left cingulate gyrus. Cannabis usersshowed enhanced reward anticipation activity in the middletemporal gyrus bilaterally, right cuneus and right parahippocam-pal gyrus. When compared to tobacco-smoking controls, cannabisusers also showed reduced anticipation activity in the same areas,with the exception of the nucleus accumbens bilaterally, the rightmedial frontal gyrus and the left cingulated gyrus, indicating thatanticipation activity in these regions may be attenuated by bothcannabis and nicotine [176]. In accordance with Nestor et al. (2010) [175], response to contrasted outcome notification wasassociated with greater activity in the putamen bilaterally and theright caudate nucleus compared with non-smoking controls [176].The putamen was more activated in cannabis users than in non-smokers and tobacco-smoking controls, indicating that changes inthis area were mainly due to cannabis use [176].
Motor performance
Kinget al. (2011) [174] reported that chronic cannabis use wasassociated with slower and less efficient psychomotor function,especially in male users. Cannabis users showed lesser activation inthe lingual gyrus and greater activation of the superior frontalgyrus compared to controls while performing a visually pacedfinger sequencing task, suggesting that the former group shiftedfrom more automated visually-guided responses to more executiveor attention control regions of the brain [174].
Affective processing
Gruberet al. (2009) [170] examined the BOLD signal changesfor two target affective conditions (happy and anger). Region ofinterest analyses revealed that cannabis users demonstratedrelatively lower anterior cingulate and amygdalar activity duringthe presentation of masked angry stimuli sets relative to the controlgroup, who showed relatively higher activation within theseregions. In contrast, cannabis users demonstrated a larger patternof activation during the presentation of masked happy faces withinthe cingulate as compared to controls, with no increase inamygdalar activation [170]. Furthermore, the total number ofsmoking episodes per week was positively associated with cingulateactivity during the viewing of masked angry faces and positivelyassociated with amygdalar activity during the viewing of maskedhappy faces [170]. Finally, overall cannabinoid level was positivelyrelated to cingulate activity during the viewing of masked happyfaces [170]. The disparate activation patterns showed betweengroups suggest a different way of processing emotional informationbetween groups [170].4. Functional neuroimaging studies in adolescent chroniccannabis
We included five case-control fMRI studies in adolescentcannabis users comparing brain activity with healthy controlsduring a cognitive task performance. As an exception, two of them[180,181] were included despite involving a minor proportion ofparticipants with a co-morbid alcohol dependence given therelatively modest number of studies in this population (for detailssee Table 2). No resting state studies were identified in theadolescent population.
Memory
Padulaet al. (2007) [179] and Schweinsburg et al. (2008, 2010) [180,181] examined fMRI response during a spatial workingmemory (SWM) task. In a group of abstinent adolescent cannabisusers, Padulaet al. (2007) [179] described increased activity in theleft temporal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex but lower activityin right temporal gyrus, thalamus, pulvinar and left parahippo-campal gyrus related to higher scores on the task, while the reversepattern was found in the controls. This may suggest that cannabisusers employed more of a verbal strategy to achieve the same levelof task performance as the controls [179]. Additionally, cannabisusers demonstrated greater performance-related activation in theright basal ganglia, precuneus, postcentral gyrus and bilateralsuperior parietal lobe [179], again suggesting a compensatoryneural effort. Consistent with this, Schweinsburg et al. (2008) [180] also found a different pattern of activation in abstinent adolescentcannabis users who performed the SWM task similarly to thecontrol group. Thus, cannabis users demonstrated higher activa-tion in the right parietal cortex but also lower activity in the rightdorsolateral prefrontal and occipital cortices [180]. Finally, in across-sectional study, Schweinsburg et al. (2010) [181] comparedfMRI responses using the same task among adolescent cannabisusers with brief and sustained cannabis abstinence and healthycontrols. Although both groups performed at a similar level on thetask, recent users showed greater activity in the medial and leftsuperior prefrontal cortices and bilateral insula while abstinentusers demonstrated an increased response in the right precentralgyrus [181]. More recently, Schweinsburg et al. (2011) [182] compared fMRI response during a verbal paired associatesencoding task in 3 groups of participants that included anabstinent cannabis user group, a binge drinker group and acannabis user group with co-morbid binge-drinking to healthycontrols with very limited alcohol or cannabis experience. Ingeneral, each group displayed deviations in BOLD responserelative to non-using controls, and binge drinking and cannabisuse demonstrated independent as well as interactive effects onbrain functioning [182].
Inhibition and impulsivity
In a group of abstinent cannabis users, Tapert et al. (2007) [183] compared the activation pattern on a go/no-go task during fMRIwith seventeen healthy subjects. Despite similar level of taskperformance, cannabis users showed greater activation duringinhibitory trials in the right dorsolateral prefrontal, bilateralmedial frontal, bilateral inferior and superior parietal lobules andright occipital gyrus compared to the healthy subjects. During thenon-inhibitory trials, differences were located in right prefrontal,insular and parietal cortices, with cannabis users showing greaterNeuroimaging Studies in Chronic Cannabis Users

Discussion
In this systematic review, we identified 43 studies suitable forinclusion regarding the impact of chronic cannabis use on brainstructure and functioning, of which eight (19%) were in theadolescent population. Despite the high degree of heterogeneityamong the studies reviewed herein, several relatively consistentfindings emerged from this review. These findings, discussed indetail below, include: (1) Structural brain abnormalities, mainly inCB
1-rich areas implicated in several cognitive functions, whichmay be related to the amount of cannabis use; (2) Altered neuralactivity during resting state and under several different types ofcognitive paradigms, that may reflect a different recruitment ofbrain areas during the tasks, particularly within the prefrontalcortex; and (3) The few studies conducted in adolescents suggestthat both structural and functional alterations may appear soonafter starting the drug use and may be related to gender.In terms of structural findings, specific regional brain analysesdemonstrated evidence of structural abnormalities when adultchronic cannabis users were compared with healthy controls. Themost consistently reported brain alteration was reduced hippo-campal volume [145,146,148,149], which was shown to persisteven after several months of abstinence in one study [145] and alsoto be related to the amount of cannabis use [145,146,149]. Otherfrequently reported morphological brain alterations related tochronic cannabis use were reported in the amygdala[146,149,156], the cerebellum [146,155] and the frontal cortex[148,154]. Lastly, two DTI studies found differences in the meandiffusivity or fractional anisotropy in the corpus callosum and thefrontal white matter fibre tract [144,147], suggesting that chroniccannabis exposure may also alter white matter structural integrity,by either affecting demyelination or causing axonal damage orindirectly through delaying normal brain development. Withregard to the few structural MRI studies focusing on the effects ofcannabis use on brain morphology in adolescents, some discrep-ancies were reported related to adult population. These inconsis-tencies may be explained in terms of the disruption of normalpruning during developmental maturation due to early chroniccannabis use, ultimately resulting in larger regional volumes [156].Notwithstanding, structural results from adolescent populationsuggest that the effects of chronic cannabis use may appear soonafter starting the drug use, persist after a month of abstinence oreven be moderated by gender [145,154–156]. In this context, ithas been reported that adolescent female cannabis users may be atincreased risk for cannabis-induced morphological effects[154,156].Functional neuroimaging studies that have evaluated the restingstate in active and abstinent adult chronic cannabis users suggestthat resting global [158], prefrontal cortical [157–159], cerebellar[157] and striatal [159] blood flow may be lower compared withcontrols. These brain regions correspond to areas with relativelyhigh concentration of CB1 receptors [19]. Hence, it has beenhypothesised that the decreased resting state function mayrepresent a down-regulation of CB1 receptors as a result ofregular exposure to cannabis [41]. However, it is important tonote that not all studies have consistently demonstrated effects inthese regions. Furthermore, it has been recently found that, similarto animal studies, down-regulation of CB1 receptors in humans isregion-specific and reversible, occurring in the neocortex andlimbic cortex but neither in subcortical brain regions nor in thecerebellum [163]. It is also noteworthy that these brain regionscorrespond to areas that are engaged in the processing of reward[184]. This is also consistent with the evidence of neuropsycho-logical impairments in chronic cannabis users, such as in attentionand working memory [185], decision making [186], andpsychomotor speed [187]. Also, consistent with experimentalanimal studies, no differences in striatal D2/D3 receptoravailability were found in four studies of chronic cannabis userscompared with healthy controls [159–162]. However, in the onlystudy where the chronic cannabis users were not abstinent [161],an inverse correlation between recent cannabis consumption andD2/D3 receptor availability was found, leading the authors tosuggest that this effect could be related to a direct effect ofcannabis smoking on the expression of striatal DA receptors inheavy cannabis users [161]. Additional studies are needed to betterunderstand the neurochemical basis of this finding.Functional imaging studies comparing activation in both adultand adolescent chronic cannabis users with healthy controlsduring the performance of different cognitive tasks indicated thatchronic cannabis users would use similar brain areas that engagethese cognitive processes but often demonstrating an alteredpattern of brain activity [151,152,157,165–177,179,181–183].However, the level of performance of the cannabis users on thecognitive tasks employed was generally similar to that of controls[164,165,168,171,174,177], or at least within what may beconsidered a normal range of test performance. Therefore, thesefindings may be interpreted as reflecting neuroadaptation, perhapsindicating the recruitment of additional regions as a compensatorymechanism to maintain normal cognitive performance in responseto chronic cannabis exposure [151,152,164,166,171,172,175,179–181,183], particularly within the prefrontal cortex area[151,166,168,169,171,181,183]. In this regard, the brain seemsable to achieve some degree of reorganization, activating brainregions not usually needed to perform the cognitive task inresponse to an impaired ability of the normally engaged tasknetwork. Thus, it is feasible that drug-related compensatorymechanism may work for a period of time until it turns out to beinsufficient and differences between groups become apparent.However, the impact of these subtle brain alterations on social,familiar and occupational life as well as its potential relationshipwith psychiatric disorders remains speculative.A further important issue emerging out of this review is that fewstudies have investigated the effects of chronic cannabis use on thebrain in adolescence subjects. In light of the popularity of cannabisamong teenagers [1,2] and recent data showing the potentialneurotoxic effects of chronic cannabis use on the maturationalbrain [188], investigation of the possible long-term effects on brainstructure and function in the adolescent population should be apriority both from the scientific and population health perspective[34,188]. Future studies should consider the need for convergentmethodology, replication of known facts with greater methodo-logical rigor, and prospective large samples involving subjects ofboth genders across the life-span from adolescence to adulthood todelineate the evolution and reversibility of previously reportedalterations.
Limitations of the review
Results presented here have pointed out some importantmethodological differences that limit the generalisation of resultsand comparison between studies and have doubtless contributed tothe slightly disparate array of findings. Despite the use of a strictdefinition of chronic cannabis user and robust application ofinclusion and exclusion criteria in an attempt to avoid excessiveheterogeneity between samples, studies often diverged on certainNeuroimaging Studies in Chronic Cannabis Users
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 13 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e55821 socio-demographic characteristics and cannabis use parameters,such as gender-bias, age of onset, lifetime use and abstinence periodbefore the acquisition of imaging data. Moreover, it is well knownthat the THC content of smoked cannabis varies markedly betweensources and preparations, with potency reported to have increasedsubstantially over the past ten years [2]. Thus, comparability ofearlier to later studies may not always be appropriate [44].Furthermore, the exclusion of studies involving recreational andnaı¨ve cannabis users implies that the question of whether the brainsof these subjects are adversely affected by cannabis is not addressedwithin the framework of the present review. Another importantconfounding factor is the inclusion of subjects with concurrent use oftobacco, which may affect neural activity as well as potentiallyinteract with the effects of cannabis use [176]. In addition, it isknown that co-morbid misuse of alcohol and other illicit drugs, suchas cocaine and methamphetamine, may also be associated withsignificant neurobiological, neurocognitive and psychiatric abnor-malities [189]. In the present review, although we excluded studiesinvolving subjects with alcohol dependence, some included subjectswith alcohol misuse (abuse [145,179] or excessive consumption[150]), or reported differences in alcohol intake parametersto]despite alcohol consumption was within safe limits[143,144,147,156,157,163,164,169,170]. Moreover, given the rel-atively modest number of studies in the adolescent population, weincluded four studies which may involve some participants with co-morbid alcohol dependence [154,155,180,181]. In all these studies,the interaction of alcohol with cannabis use, as well as itscontribution to the brain effects cannot be ruled out. On the otherhand, the exclusion of those with alcohol dependence, often highlyco-morbid with cannabis use, may restrict the generalization of theresults to the majority of chronic cannabis users [190].With regard to other methodological limitations, some studieshave reported modest sample sizes, sometimes below the thresholdthat would be currently regarded as acceptable (for instance, forPET or SPECT studies 10 subjects and for fMRI studies 15subjects) [29]. In this regard, strategies for expanding data-sharingwould be a welcome development in future research (i.e. TheFunction Biomedical Informatics Research Network [191] or the1000 Functional Connectomes project [192,193]). However,further obstacles must be addressed to make collaborative analysisefficient, such as between-site differences in scanners and dataacquisition parameters, as well as pre- and post-processingschemes. The cross-sectional designs of most of the studiesreviewed here complicated the interpretation of results as pre-existing morphological or functional alterations cannot be ruledout. Furthermore, studies that merely compare those subjectsexposed to an environmental factor from those that are not, arelikely to promote interpretation biases whereby study findings,irrespective of their direction, tend to be interpreted as detrimen-tal. Longitudinal evaluations in larger samples may thus proveparticularly useful. With regard to technical limitations, it isremarkable to note that the resting state studies did not control forspontaneous neutral activity and modulation of the BOLD signal,and the functional studies often reported different imagingmethods and explored different brain functions using diversecognitive paradigms, hampering the comparison between thestudies. Hence, replication of previous results is criticallyimportant. Convergent methodology to sort out the currentinconsistencies and controversies among studies would be impor-tant for future research in the field.

Cannabis use is highly prevalent among people with schizo-phrenia, and coupled with impaired cognition, is thought toheighten the risk of illness onset. However, while heavycannabis use has been associated with cognitive deﬁcitsin long-term users, studies among patients with schizophre-nia have been contradictory. This article consists of 2 stud-ies. In Study I, a meta-analysis of 10 studies comprising572 patients with established schizophrenia (with and with-out comorbid cannabis use) was conducted. Patients witha history of cannabis use were found to have superior neuro-psychological functioning. This ﬁnding was largely drivenby studies that included patients with a lifetime history ofcannabis use rather than current or recent use. In Study II,we examined the neuropsychological performance of 85patients with ﬁrst-episode psychosis (FEP) and 43 healthynonusing controls. Relative to controls, FEP patients witha history of cannabis use (FEP1CANN;n559) dis- played only selective neuropsychological impairments whilethose without a history (FEP2CANN;n526) displayedgeneralized deficits. When directly compared, FEP1 CANN patients performed better on tests of visual mem-ory, working memory, and executive functioning. Patientswith early onset cannabis use had less neuropsychologicalimpairment than patients with later onset use. Together,these findings suggest that patients with schizophrenia orFEP with a history of cannabis use have superior neuropsy-chological functioning compared with nonusing patients.This association between better cognitive performanceand cannabis use in schizophrenia may be driven by a sub-group of ‘‘neurocognitively less impaired’’ patients, whoonly developed psychosis after a relatively early initiationinto cannabis use.Key words:schizophrenia/psychosis/marijuana/drug/neuropsychology/comorbidityIntroductionRates of substance use disorders among individuals withschizophrenia are higher than the general population,

with cannabis being the most commonly abused illicitdrug.

8–12including resid-ual deficits in memory and attention, even several daysfollowing abstinence.
13–16Our studies in individuals withno medical or psychiatric history have shown that long-term cannabis use is associated with structural brainabnormalities and subthreshold psychotic symptomsin a dose-dependent manner.
8However, among patientswith schizophrenia, the association is less clear. Whileacute administration of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) topatients with schizophrenia exacerbates symptoms andcognitive impairments and may have enduring effects,
17
cannabis has also been found to have some beneficialeffects on cognition, at least in certain subgroups ofpatients.
18–20Thus, while cannabis use is traditionally as-sociated with cognitive impairment, the relationship ismore complex in the case of schizophrenia.Although a recent meta-analysis conducted by Potvinand colleagues
21supports this notion, their analysis doesnot include studies conducted after 2006 and is notSchizophrenia Bulletinvol. 38 no. 2 pp. 316–330, 2012doi:10.1093/schbul/sbq079Advance Access publication on July 25, 2010

316 focused on cannabis specifically but includes patientswith polysubstance abuse. Here, we present 2 studiesthat aim to clarify the nature of the association betweencannabis use and cognitive impairments observed inschizophrenia. The first study comprises a meta-analysisof empirical investigations of cannabis effects on cogni-tion in patients with established schizophrenia. In thesecond study, we compared the neuropsychological func-tioning of patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP)with and without a history of cannabis use as well ashealthy controls with no substance use history.Study I: Meta-analysis of Findings To DateMethodsWe performed a literature search using PUBMED, Psyc-INFO, and Scopus covering the period between 1987and March 2010. Combinations of the following key-words were used: schizophrenia, psychosis, cannabis, sub-stance, cognit*, and neuropsycholog*. The reference listsof the published articles were also reviewed. Inclusion cri-teria included: (1) diagnosis of schizophrenia, (2) cogni-tive abilities of patients with and without cannabis usewere directly compared, (3) cannabis was the predomi-nant substance used by patients, and (4) studies reportedsufficient data to calculate effect sizes indmetrics.The initial search yielded 145 studies but only 15 stud-ies considered the effect of cannabis on cognition inschizophrenia (table 1). Five of these studies were ex-cluded because: (1) they lacked data for calculating effectsize,
22,23, (2) the study sample included a mixture ofpatients with schizophrenia and affective disorders,
24
and (3) they were primarily FEP studies (too few studiesin this group to conduct appropriate meta-analyses).
25,26
In 6 of the 10 studies included in the meta-analysis, can-nabis use was defined as lifetime use and in the other 4studies it was defined as recent use (current use or usein last 6 months). In 2 of the included studies,
27,28not all patients in the substance-using groups were abusingcannabis, but they were still included in the meta-analysissince cannabis was the most commonly used substancewithin the samples. In one study,
29we used data fromthe 3-month follow-up assessment only since some patientshad very recently used substances at baseline or wereacutely intoxicated at the time of testing. Overall, ourmeta-analysis included 10 studies involving 572 patientswith schizophrenia (with and without comorbid cannabisuse).Neuropsychological Variables.Neuropsychologicalvariables were grouped according to the 6 cognitivedomains of the Measurement and Treatment Researchto Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS)battery
30(table 2). A ‘‘Global cognition index’’ was cal-culated by averaging effect sizes from each domain foreach study. We used global scores of cognition fromthe Study I of Løberg et al29because their classificationof cognitive domains differed from the MATRICS.Meta-analytical Procedure.For each cognitive test, ef-fect size (Cohen’sd) and SE were calculated. Effect sizeswere defined as the mean difference between the schizo-phrenia patients’ and healthy controls’ performancedivided by the pooled SD. Effect sizes were weighted us-ing the inverse variance method. A random effects modelwas used. Homogeneity of the mean-weighted effect sizeswas tested using the Q-test, while publication bias wasassessed using Egger’s test. Only instances where therewere heterogeneity or publication biases are describedin the Results. Meta-analyses were performed usingMIX software.
31Meta-regression analyses examined theeffect of moderator variables on between-group differ-ences. This was performed with random effects modelingusing the restricted-information maximum likelihoodmethod with a significance level set atP<.05. These anal-yses were conducted in SPSS version 16.0 using the macroswritten by DB Wilson (http://mason.gmu.edu/;dwilsonb/ ma.html). Separate meta-analyses were also performedfor studies defining cannabis use as ‘‘lifetime’’ or ‘‘recent’’(current/last 6 months) use.ResultsThere were significant differences between the SCZþ CANN and SCZ/C0CANN groups for gender, age, edu-cation, age of onset of illness, and positive symptoms.The SCZþCANN group comprised more males(RR=1.10, CI=0.99–1.22,Z=1.75,P=.08), had less education (d=0.40, CI=0.21–0.60,Z=4.01,P< .001), a younger age (d=0.57, CI=0.36–0.79,Z= 5.29,P<.001), more severe positive symptoms (d= 0.65, CI=0.41–0.90,Z=5.15,P<.001), and earlierillness onset (d=0.42, CI=0.19–0.65,Z=3.59,P= .003). There were no significant between-group differ-ences for duration of illness, negative symptoms, andpremorbid IQ.Global Cognition Index.Eight studies reported superiorperformance for SCZþCANN patients on global cog-nition (see table 3; figure 1). The studies that reported bet-ter performance in SCZþCANN tended to definecannabis use as lifetime use. Overall, SCZþCANN patients performed significantly better than SCZ/C0 CANN patients (d=0.35). The distribution of effect sizesobserved in these studies was not homogeneous. In sep-arate analyses for studies using lifetime or recent canna-bis use criteria, no more heterogeneity was observed.SCZþCANN patients performed significantly betteronly in the studies defining use by lifetime exposure(d=0.55) but not in the studies using recent use criteria(d=0.03). Meta-regression analyses did not reveal anyImpact of Cannabis Use on Cognitive Functioning in Patients With Schizophrenia

Therewere minimal between-group differences on a sustainedattention task (d=0.26).Processing Speed.Eight studies examined processingspeed. The SCZþCANN patients had significantly fast-er processing speeds than SCZ/C0CANN patients (d= 0.40). Effect sizes were not homogeneously distributed,however, when recent use vs lifetime defining studieswas examined separately, there was no evidence for het-erogeneous distribution of effect sizes. SCZþCANN patients performed significantly better than SCZ/C0 CANN only within the lifetime defining studies ( d= 0.65) but not in those studies with recent use criteria(d=0.09).Visual Memory.Three studies assessed visual memory.Again, SCZþCANN patients performed better thanSCZ/C0CANN patients (d=0.45).Verbal Memory.Four studies reported verbal memorymeasures. There was no significant between-group differ-ence for verbal memory (d=0.0). The Q-test showed ev-idence for heterogeneity for distribution of effect sizes.When the 3 lifetime defining studies were examined sep-arately, between-group comparisons remained nonsignif-icant (d=0.18).Working Memory.Four studies examined workingmemory. There was no significant between-group differ-ence (d=0.13). While distribution of effect sizes was het-erogeneous, the between-group difference for 2 lifetimedefining studies wasd=0.64, with the SCZþCANN group demonstrating significantly superior performance.The between-group difference for recent use criteria stud-ies was not significant (d=/C00.28). There was no evidenceof heterogeneity for these separate analyses.Executive Functioning.In the 4 studies included in thisdomain, cannabis use was associated with better planningand reasoning abilities (d=0.47).

19as they did not exclude patientsusing cannabis in the week prior to testing. Patients withSCZþCANN without recent use demonstrated betterverbal memory performance than the SCZ/C0CANN group (d=0.46, CI=0.05–0.88,Z=2.20,P=.03). Dis- tribution of effect sizes was more homogenous with thisanalysis (P=.52).Frequency of Cannabis Use.One study reported an as-sociation between higher frequency of cannabis useand better cognitive performance (working memoryand attentional tasks; Schnell et al).
20
Age of Onset of Cannabis Use.Only one study examinedthe relationship between age of onset of cannabis use andcognitive deficits.
19In this study, earlier starting age ofcannabis use (ie, before 17 years of age) was associatedwith superior cognitive performance.Effectof OtherSubstances.A separate meta-analysis forthe 2 studies
19,20consisting of patients without comorbidsubstance use (other than nicotine) was conducted. Wefound a similar mean effect size for global cognition(d=0.43) to that observed in the overall meta-analysis.One study also examined the effect of comorbid alcoholuse in cannabis-using patients and failed to find any sig-nificant difference between alcohol-using and nonusinggroups.
32One study found that cocaine-using SCZþ CANN patients were cognitively more impaired.
28Summary of Study IThese meta-analyses demonstrate that patients withestablished schizophrenia with a cannabis use historydisplay superior cognitive abilities compared with non-cannabis-using patients. These results may appear coun-terintuitive because healthy individuals who are heavycannabis users have cognitive deficits and brain abnor-malities.
8,9However, our findings are consistent with pre-vious studies conducted in schizophrenia patients withcomorbid polysubstance use,
21while showing specificityto a cannabis-using sample. Furthermore, we showedthat better cognitive performance is seen only in lifetimeusers but not in recent users.Importantly, the majority of studies to date have beenconducted in patients with chronic illness without assess-ing whether cannabis use preceded the onset of psychosis.It is possible that the cognitive profile of patients whosecannabis use may have contributed to the onset of theirpsychosis might be different from those who started usingcannabis after the onset of their psychosis. Studies exam-ining cannabis use prior to the onset of FEP are especiallyuseful in this regard because cannabis use may contributeto the onset of psychosis only in these patients. Five stud-ies have examined cognitive functioning in a sample whoused cannabis before the onset of psychosis.
25,26,33How- ever, the studies of Stirling et al,
33Jockers-Scherubl et al,19
and Schnell et al20included a chronic sample, and it wasnot possible to exclude the effects of cannabis use afterthe onset of psychosis or illness-related factors. Whilethe studies of de la Serna et al
25and Mata et al26were also FEP samples, they only assessed cannabis use inthe previous one month or in the previous 12 months,meaning that their cannabis nonuser samples were likely

321Impact of Cannabis Use on Cognitive Functioning in Patients With Schizophrenia to have also included patients who had a past history ofcannabis use.Thus, there are no FEP studies that have examinedcognitive functioning in FEP patients with a lifetime his-tory of cannabis use. In our second study, we report onsuch a sample. Additionally, given that the age of canna-bis use onset has been found to be an important moder-ator of the association between cannabis use andpsychotic illness,
34–37we investigated the impact of ageof cannabis use onset on cognitive functioning.Study II: New Data in FEP PatientsMethodsSample and Setting.Participants included 85 FEPpatients and 43 healthy nonusing controls. Participantswere selected from a larger neuropsychological researchdatabase (described previously
38–40) only if they wereassessed for substance use. While all participants agreedto a cognitive test battery, some participants had an in-complete cognitive assessment. A detailed substance usehistory, including information concerning the amount,frequency, duration, and type of substance use, diagno-sis, time since last use, and age of onset of regular use, wasobtained using a combination of medical history notesand structured clinical and research interviews (ie, sub-stance use module of the Structured Clinical Interviewfor DSM-IV [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of MentalDisorders, Fourth Edition], Patient version [SCID-I/P],
41
Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness Scale42). In addition, substance use data were gathered from theEarly Psychosis File Questionnaire,
43which was usedto systematically extract data on premorbid, entry, treat-ment, and discharge characteristics from consecutivemedical files. Cannabis was the predominant substanceused in FEP patients. FEP patients with a history of reg-ular use (defined as>2 years of use and>2 g per week)were classified as cannabis users (n=59; FEPþCANN), and a large majority of these patients met criteria for Di- agnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,Third Revision(DSM-III-R) cannabis abuse or depen-dence (see below). FEP patients without a history ofregular cannabis use were classified as nonusers ( n= 26; FEP/C0CANN). Cannabis use was assessed overeach subject’s lifetime, and none of the FEP/C0CANN group had ever used cannabis regularly (ie, had notused on a weekly basis for>12 months), while all FEPþ CANN patients used cannabis before the onset of the ill-ness. Of the 26 FEP/C0CANN patients, 3 had a past his-tory of alcohol abuse and 4 others had experimented withstimulants and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).All patients with FEP were recruited from the EarlyPsychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre at OrygenYouth Health and were diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders according to DSM-III-R criteriabased on a medical record review and structured clinicalinterview using the Positive and Negative SyndromeScale,44SCID-I/NP41and the Royal Park Multi-diagnos-tic Instrument for Psychosis (McGorry et al
45). For con-trols, we used the SCID-I (nonpatient edition). Of the 59patients classified as cannabis users (FEPþCANN), 55met criteria for past or current cannabis abuse or depen-dence. Thirty-two of the FEPþCANN had started to usecannabis at 16 years of age or earlier (FEPþCAN- N[early]) and 27 had started at age 17 or thereafter(FEPþCANN[later]). We chose to compare thosewho had commenced using cannabis before or afterages 16–17 years on the basis of previous literature sug-gesting that exposure to cannabis prior to this period ofadolescence has relatively greater adverse consequencescompared with later initiation,
12,46and this cutoff en-abled a roughly equal division of the sample. All were ab-stinent at the time of assessment (according to self-report,medical records/case notes, and researcher observations),34 for>1 month, while 10 had consumed cannabis withinthe previous week, and a further 10 for between 8 and 30days prior to the assessment (data were missing for 5cases). Fifteen of the FEPþCANN patients also hada history of stimulant and hallucinogen use (mainly am-phetamine), and 16 others had a history of alcohol abuse.Most patients (n=51) were prescribed antipsychotic med-ication (35 risperidone, 14 olanzapine, and 2 typical anti-psychotics), while 10 were prescribed mood stabilizers (5lithium and 5 sodium valproate) and 7 were prescribedantidepressants (5 SSRI, 1 imipramine, and 1 moclobe-mide). Chlorpromazine equivalents (cpz) of antipsy-chotics were calculated.
47
Healthy controls comprised 43 individuals with nocurrent or past history of illicit substance abuse or depen-dence. Healthy volunteers were recruited by approachingancillary hospital staff (eg, nonprofessional staff and stu-dents) and through advertisements in local newspapers inthe same catchment area as the patients (ie, north-westernregions of Melbourne) as well as through ‘‘word ofmouth’’ (ie, friends of patients).All participants were screened for comorbid medicalconditions. Exclusion criteria were a history of headinjury causing loss of consciousness for greater than1 minute and/or hospitalization, neurological disorders,thyroid disorders, documented poor eyesight or hearing,and history of corticosteroid use. Control participantswith family or personal histories of psychiatric illnesswere also excluded. Local research and ethics committeesapproved the study, and written informed consent wasobtained from all individuals prior to study participation.Cognition.All participants were administered a cogni-tive test battery by experienced psychologists. Neuropsy-chological tasks targeted general intelligence, processingspeed, verbal memory, visual memory, working memory,and executive functioning (planning and reasoning).

48The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale—Revised(WAIS-R) was used to estimate current IQ.

Processing Speed.The Trail-Making Test (Part A) andDigit Symbol Coding were used as measures of process-ing speed.
49,50
Visual Memory.Visual Paired Associates (part I) andVisual Reproduction (part I) from the Wechsler MemoryScale—Revised (WMS-R) provided measures of visuallearning and memory.
51Spatial and Pattern Recognitiontests from the Cambridge Automated Neuropsychologi-cal Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) were used to in-dex recognition memory.
52,53
Verbal Memory.A modified version (3 trials instead of5) of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test was used asa measure of verbal learning and delayed recall.
54The Logical Memory (parts I and II) component of theWMS-R was also used.
51
Working Memory.Spatial Span and Spatial WorkingMemory (SWM) from the CANTAB were used to indexworking memory.
53,55Regarding SWM, 2 scores were in-cluded in the analysis: (1) total between-search errors(SWM-errors), which is the number of times that a subjectreturns to a box in which a token had already been foundduring a previous search sequence and (2) strategy score(SWM-strategy), a measure of the ability to adopt a sys-tematic search approach (ie, initiating a search from thesame token across trials shows better strategy use). WhileSWM-errors is a more pure measure of short-term work-ing memory, strategy score also measures central execu-tive functioning.Executive Functioning.Block Design from the WAIS-Rand the Tower of London (ToL) tests were used as meas-ures of planning and reasoning ability.

StatisticalAnalyses.Statistical analyses were conductedusing the Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version16.0 (SPSS 16.0). Between-group differences on categor-ical variables were tested using chi-square analysis.Patients’ scores on cognitive tests were converted to z scores based on the controls’ performance. ANCOVAwas used to test group differences between FEP/C0 CANN and FEPþCANN on continuous measureswith gender and age as covariates. ANCOVA analyseswere also used to compare FEP/C0CANN, FEPþCAN- N[early], and FEPþCANN[later]. SignificantF- statistics were followed up with post hoc analyses usingthe Tukey test. Cohen’sdalso characterized between-group differences.57Pearson product moment correlationwas used to examine relationships between cognition,parameters of cannabis use, and clinical measures.ResultsDemographic.There was no significant between-groupdifference for age and gender (see table 4). FEP patientswho use cannabis were less educated than controls butdid not differ from FEP/C0CANN, while the latter didnot differ from controls.FEP/C0CANN and FEPþCANN vs Controls.FEP patients (with and without comorbid cannabis) were signif-i c a n t l yi m p a i r e do na l l1 6t a s k sc o m p a r e dw i t hc o n t r o l s .Effect sizes of these impairments in all 6 cognitive domainswere moderate to large, ranging from 0.52 to 2.11. Themost pronounced impairments were observed for CurrentIQ (d=2.11), Logical Memory (d=1.70), SWM-errors (d= 1.60), and Digit Symbol Coding (d=1.48).WhenwecomparedeachoftheFEPþCANNandFEP/C0 CANN groups separately to controls, the FEP/C0CANN patients were significantly impaired on 15 of the 16 tasks ad-ministered across the 6 cognitive domains, while the FEPþ CANN group showed only selective impairments (9 of the16 tasks) (table 5; figure 2). Both FEPþCANN and FEP/C0 CANN patients were significantly impaired for all tasks ofgeneral intelligence, verbal memory, and processing speed.Unlike the FEP/C0CANN group, the FEPþCANN groupwas not significantly different from controls on most tasksof visual memory and planning/reasoning.

323Impact of Cannabis Use on Cognitive Functioning in Patients With Schizophrenia in SWM-errors but not in SWM-strategy or Spatial Span.FEPþCANN patients did not differ from controls on theToL task involving planning and reasoning.FEP/C0CANNvsFEPþCANN.FEPþCANN patientstended to perform better than FEP/C0CANN patients butthis difference was significant only for 3 variables (table 5;figure 2). On verbal and nonverbal memory, between-group differences were small to moderate (dranged from 0.3 to 0.6) and FEPþCANN performed signifi-cantly better on visual reproduction. For the workingmemory domain, small to medium effect sizes were ob-served and a between-group difference for SWM-errorsreached significance (ie, with FEPþCANN performingbetter). For executive functioning, a significant between-group difference with a large effect size (d=0.90) was observed for the ToL test (again with FEPþCANN per-forming better).ComorbidSubstanceUse.ANCOVA analyses were con-ducted to examine the effect of additional illicit substanceuse (over lifetime) on cognition in the FEPþCANN patients. FEPþCANN patients who also used amphet-amines (n=12) did not perform significantly differentlyto the remaining (nonamphetamine using) FEPþCANN patients on any cognitive measure (dranged from/C00.50to/C00.39). Similarly, no significant differences were foundbetween the alcohol-using and nonusing FEPþCANN patients (dranged from/C00.10 toþ0.54).Age of Onset of Cannabis Use.When comparing the non-cannabis-using patients (FEP/C0CANN) with early onset(/C2016 years; FEPþCANN[early]) and later onset (/C2117 years; FEPþCANN[later]) cannabis-using patients, wefound group differences for 4 cognitive tests (SWM-errors,ToL, Pattern Recognition, and Spatial Recognition). TheFEP/C0CANN patients did not differ from FEPþCANN [later] on any cognitive tests (figure 3). FEPþCAN- N[early] patients performed significantly better thanFEP/C0CANN on all 4 of the above cognitive tests andbetter than FEPþCANN[later] on 2 tests (Pattern Recog-nition and Spatial Recognition). The FEPþCANN[early]group were younger than the FEPþCANN[later] group(table 6) but did not differ in duration or monthly quantityof cannabis use, diagnosis, treatment, or antipsychotic lev-els (based on chlorpromazine equivalents; see table 6).Recency of Cannabis Use.FEP patients who had usedcannabis in the previous week were more impaired onLogical Memory compared with patients who were absti-nent for greater than 1 month prior to testing (P=.04).

In both FEP groups, the Positive and Negative SyndromeScale negative symptoms score was negatively correlatedwith Digit Symbol Coding (FEPþCANN:r=/C0.41, P=.006, FEP/C0CANN:r=/C0.58,P=.02) and CurrentIQ (FEPþCANN:r=/C0.43,P=.002, FEP/C0CANN:r=/C0.55,P=.01). The positive symptoms score was not sig-nificantly correlated with any cognitive measure.DiscussionIn Study I, we demonstrated that regular cannabis usewas associated with better cognitive performance inschizophrenia. Cannabis-using patients performed mod-erately better than nonusing patients on measures ofglobal cognition, visual memory, processing speed, work-ing memory, planning, and reasoning. This differencewas largely driven by studies that included patientswith a lifetime history of cannabis use rather than justthose with current or recent use. Consistent with previousstudies, cannabis use was associated with a younger ageof psychosis onset, male sex, and more positive symp-toms.
7,36,58–60Study II examined the effect of regularcannabis use on cognition in FEP patients. Cognitive per-formance of FEP patients with a history of cannabis usewas compared with FEP patients without a history ofsubstance use and healthy controls on 6 cognitivedomains. Unlike most previous studies, we also examinedthe effect of variables such as recency and frequency ofuse and age of onset of cannabis use. The findingswere consistent with Study I and demonstrated thatFEP patients who used cannabis (especially those whoused prior to age 17) also performed better than nonusingpatients in some domains and were less impaired relativeto healthy controls on cognitive domains, including vi-sual memory, working memory, planning, and reasoning.When age of onset of cannabis use was considered, supe-rior cognitive performance in cannabis-using patientsrelative to nonusing patients was only observed amongthose who started using cannabis at an early age (/C2016 years). Together, the findings of our meta-analysis andempirical study suggest that comorbid cannabis use is as-sociated with a superior cognitive profile in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.Several explanations regarding the nature of the asso-ciation between pre-illness onset cannabis use and subse-quent development of schizophrenia have beensuggested. One explanation is that cannabis is a risk fac-tor that precipitates (but does not cause) the onset of psy-chosis in genetically predisposed individuals.61However, there is also evidence that cannabis use prior to illnessonset is ‘‘causally’’ related to the development of subse-quent psychosis in vulnerable individuals.
62–64Similarly, several recent systematic reviews have indicated that can-nabis may double the risk of later developing a psychoticillness and that this association is dose dependent.

325Impact of Cannabis Use on Cognitive Functioning in Patients With Schizophrenia However, few previous studies have considered the roleof cognition. Our findings raise a number of furtherquestions concerning the relationship between cannabis,cognition, and schizophrenia.Some authors have suggested a neuroprotective roleof cannabis
66to explain the association between cannabisuse and enhanced cognition in schizophrenia patients.
19,67
Other authors suggest that, in the short-term, cannabi-noids could stimulate prefrontal neurotransmission toenhance cognitive functions,
22,34,67,68but in the long-term, repeated administration is detrimental.
12However, these postulates remain speculative and further work isnecessary. It is well recognized that acute administrationof THC impairs rather than enhances cognitive perfor-mance in both healthy controls
12,17and patients with psy-chosis
17,69, suggesting that acute neuroprotective effectsof THC are unlikely. Findings of our meta-analysis andFEP study also provide evidence regarding adverseeffects of recent cannabis use, which may partly maskthe positive association between lifetime cannabisuse and better cognition. Another possibility is thatcannabis-using patients had superior social skills in orderto be able to acquire and sustain a drug habit,
12,21which is also reflected in their cognition. Few studies havedirectly examined this possibility, and this notion isnot always supported by the extant data
70; however,we did not find any current or premorbid Global Assess-ment of Functioning (GAF) differences between FEPusers and nonusers in our study.While the FEP patients with a cannabis use historywere generally superior in their cognitive profile to thosewithout a history of cannabis use, the former group wasnot homogeneous. Indeed, the cognitive profile wasmarkedly different depending on the age of onset of can-nabis use, with the early onset group having superior cog-nition, which cannot be explained by differences in theduration or dosage of cannabis used. This finding issomewhat against expectation and is counterintuitivegiven the associations between cannabis use and cogni-tion in healthy controls (ie, worse cognition in thosewith early onset use12). It is possible that in the FEPgroup with comorbid cannabis use (characterized byonly relatively mild cognitive impairments), early onsetcannabis use increased the risk for developing psychosis,thereby facilitating the transition to frank psychosis thatmight otherwise not have occurred. That is, early canna-bis use may induce psychosis onset in less cognitively vul-nerable individuals. Schnell and colleagues
20as well as Løberg and colleagues
29have proposed a similar hypoth-esis. Support for this comes from findings that early onsetof cannabis use in adolescence, particularly before the ageof 15, is associated with greater risk for the subsequent

326M. Yu¨celet al. development of psychotic disorders, even after control-ling for preexisting psychotic symptoms.
46It is possiblethat these individuals would have remained asymptom-atic or would have been symptomatic only in subsequentyears, if they did not abuse cannabis. This notion is con-sistent with Jockers-Scherubl et al
19who found an asso-ciation between earlier onset of cannabis use and bettercognition in schizophrenia. Such a notion could also helpexplain why cessation of substance use after the first on-set of psychosis significantly increases the probability ofremission and improves long-term outcomes in FEPpatients.
71Interestingly, a recent study also found fewerneurological soft signs in heavy cannabis-using FEPpatients, supporting the notion that these patients haveless neurological impairment.
72
Other factors might also influence the associationbetween cannabis use and cognitive deficits in schizo-phrenia, including dosage and frequency of use and cu-mulative exposure. Interestingly, while higher frequencyof cannabis use could be expected to be associated withpoorer cognition, the only 2 studies that have examinedfrequency of use in schizophrenia patients found the op-posite effect (ie, better performance).
20,67While someauthors propose that such results relate to the neuropro-tective effects of cannabis,
19,66,67the findings also sup-port our hypothesis of less severe cognitive impairmentin a subgroup of neurocognitively less vulnerablepatients, with more frequent and heavy use of cannabisnecessary to induce psychosis.Our findings should be interpreted in the context ofseveral limitations. First, while the preceding discussionraises several alternative explanations for the associationbetween cannabis use and cognition in schizophrenia, thecross-sectional nature of the studies considered preventsfirm conclusions being drawn. Longitudinal studies arenecessary to better understand causal interactions be-tween relevant factors.Second, our findings of poorer cognitive performancein patients without comorbid cannabis use could relate toa sampling bias, whereby the FEP/C0CANN group mayinclude a greater proportion of ‘‘deficit syndrome’’patients or patients with poorer premorbid functioning,worse cognition,73and lower substance use.74However, the fact that the FEPþCANN group in our Study II didnot differ from the FEP/C0CANN group in terms of pos-itive or negative symptoms, suggests that the latter groupcannot be readily identified as deficit syndrome type.Furthermore, prepsychotic GAF scores and educationdid not differ between the 2 FEP groups. Consequently,our findings do not support this contention, but moreTable 6.Cannabis Use and Clinical Characteristics of Patient Groups Based on Age of Onset of Cannabis UseFEP/C0CANN (n=26) FEPþCANN[later] (n=27) FEPþCAN[early] (n=32)PValue DemographicAge (y) 20.6 (3.5) 22.2 (2.6) 19.5 (2.5) .003

327Impact of Cannabis Use on Cognitive Functioning in Patients With Schizophrenia detailed measures of premorbid functioning are requiredto conclusively address this issue.Third, given the high rates of cannabis use in FEP andthe relationship between cannabis use and the develop-ment of psychotic symptoms, it is important to considerwhat proportion of the FEPþCANN group had a can-nabis-induced psychosis. The diagnostic criteria for sub-stance-induced psychosis have recently been criticized,
75
as a diagnosis of cannabis-induced psychosis is unlikelyto be made if psychotic symptoms are still apparent 1month following intoxication. Therefore, better cognitiveperformance, early onset use, and improvement withabstinence may be partially explained by inclusion ofFEPþCANN patients with a cannabis-induced psycho-sis rather than an actual schizophrenia-spectrum disor-der. Better diagnostic instruments and longitudinalassessments are required to examine this issue further.Fourth, comorbid abuse of other substances could alsoaffect the results because both cocaine and alcohol usehave been associated with worse cognitive functioningin schizophrenia. However, the 2 studies (including ourown) that examined the effect of comorbid alcohol useon cognition did not find an association.
21Examinationof larger samples is necessary to properly examine theeffect of comorbid alcohol abuse on cognition. Thestudy of Potvin et al
21suggested that comorbid cocaineuse could have a detrimental effect on cognition incannabis-abusing patients with schizophrenia,
28but this finding is unlikely to influence the current results be-cause there was minimal cocaine abuse in the studies in-cluded in our meta-analysis or among patients in ourFEP study.Fifth, it is possible that some components of cannabis,such as cannabidiol (a nonintoxicating constituent of can-nabis sativa), might relieve psychotic symptoms andthereby improve cognition.
76,77There is also some evidenceto suggest that, in certain subgroups of schizophreniapatients, THC administration shows beneficial effects.
18
However, more research is required to understand thesecomplex actions in the context of schizophrenia.Sixth, the number of studies included was small andrestricted our analysis to investigate broad rather thanspecific aspects of cognition (or individual cognitivetasks). Finally, studies included in the meta-analysishad small samples and low quality of data on several im-portant parameters, such as duration of illness; age of on-set of either cannabis use or psychosis; and frequency,quantity, or duration of cannabis use.In conclusion, our meta-analysis and experimentaldata converge to indicate that cannabis use in bothFEP and established schizophrenia is associated with bet-ter cognitive performance than nonuse, and fewer cogni-tive impairments relative to healthy controls. Theassociation between better cognitive performance andcannabis use is driven by a subgroup of neurocognitivelyless impaired patients, who only developed psychosisafter an early initiation of cannabis use (ie, during earlyadolescence). However, longitudinal studies in high-riskpopulations are needed to test this notion more deci-sively. Together, these findings suggest that a subgroupof psychotic patients may show improved outcomes(ie, partial recovery of cognitive functioning and less dis-ability) if their cannabis use can be controlled. Moreover,our findings support the notion that, in some vulnerableindividuals, abstinence from cannabis abuse could poten-tially prevent the development of psychosis.FundingNational Health and Medical Research Council(NHMRC) of Australia (Grant 236175, 459111,514604) and the University of Melbourne; NHMRCClinical Career Development Awards (Grant 509345/454792 to M.Y. and W.J.B.); Colonial Foundation (toD.I.L.); NHMRC Clinical Career Developmental Awardand a National Alliance for Research on Schizophreniaand Depression Young Investigator Award (to S.J.W.);NHMRC CJ Martin Training Fellowship (454797 toA.F.); Ronald Phillip Griffith Fellowship, Faculty ofMedicine, Dentistry, and Health Sciences, the Universityof Melbourne (to S.C.); NHMRC Senior PrincipalResearch Fellowship (628386) and NHMRC ProgramGrants (350241, 566529 to C.P.); the Leenaards Foun-dation Switzerland (to P.C.).AcknowledgmentsAll authors have declared that there are no conflicts ofinterest in relation to the subject of this study.References1.

AbstractIntroduction:Chronic cannabis use has been associated with impaired cognition and elevated psychologicalsymptoms, particularly psychotic-like experiences. WhileD
9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is thought to be primar- ily responsible for these deleterious effects, cannabidiol (CBD) is purported to have antipsychotic properties andto ameliorate cognitive, symptomatic, and brain harms in cannabis users. However, this has never been tested ina prolonged administration trial in otherwise healthy cannabis users. Here, we report the ﬁrst study of prolongedCBD administration to a community sample of regular cannabis users in a pragmatic trial investigating potentialrestorative effects of CBD on psychological symptoms and cognition.Materials and Methods:Twenty frequent cannabis users (16 male, median age 25 years) underwent a 10-weekopen-label trial of 200 mg of daily oral CBD treatment, while continuing to use cannabis as usual. The majority ofparticipants were daily cannabis users who had used cannabis for several years (median 5.5 years of regular use).Participants underwent psychological and cognitive assessments at baseline (BL) and post-treatment (PT) andwere monitored weekly throughout the trial.Results:CBD was well tolerated with no reported side effects; however, participants retrospectively reported re-duced euphoria when smoking cannabis. No impairments to cognition were found, nor were there deleteriouseffects on psychological function. Importantly, part icipants reported signiﬁcantly fewer depressive and psychotic-like symptoms at PT relative to BL, and exhibited improvements in attentional switching, verbal learn-ing, and memory. Increased plasma CBD concentrations were associated with improvements in attentional con-trol and beneﬁcial changes in psychological symptoms. Greater beneﬁts were observed in dependent than innondependent cannabis users.Conclusions:Prolonged CBD treatment appears to have promising therapeutic effects for improving psycholog-ical symptoms and cognition in regular cannabis users. Our ﬁndings require replication given the lack of a pla-cebo control in this pragmatic trial, but suggest that CBD may be a useful adjunct treatment for cannabisdependence.Keywords:cannabidiol; cannabis; attention; memory; psychological symptoms

 Introduction
The global trend toward legalization of cannabis for me-dicinal and recreational use highlights an urgent need forscientiﬁc investigation of the potentially harmful andbeneﬁcial effects of its constituent compounds, particu-larly in light of ongoing concerns regarding cannabisexposure effects on health.
1,2Prolonged frequent use ofcannabis, particularly of high potency, has been associ-ated with deleterious effects on psychological function,including increased risk of developing psychosis,
3,4im-paired cognition,
5,6and alterations to brain structure7
and function.8,9These adverse outcomes have been as-sociated with the action ofD
9-tetrahydrocannabinol(THC), the primary psychoactive constituent of canna-bis, and partial agonist at central cannabinoid (CB1) re-ceptor sites.
10In contrast, the second most abundantconstituent within cannabis, cannabidiol (CBD), isthought to have a broad range of therapeutic proper-ties, including amelioration of the adverse psychologi-cal and cognitive effects of THC.
11Unlike THC, CBD isa low-afﬁnity CB1 and CB2 receptor ligand and nega-tive allosteric modulator of CB1, which reduces thebinding of CB1 agonists, while augmenting endocanna-binoid tone in an indirect manner.
12,13
Therapeutic effects of CBD have been reported acrossa range of study designs and in different populations. Instudies examining naturalistic exposure to CBD throughhair analysis in regular cannabis users, greater concen-trations of CBD have been associated with better cogni-tive performance, especially memory,
14fewer psychoticsymptoms,
15,16and increased gray matter in the hippo-campus.
17We recently demonstrated that naturalisticexposure to CBD in cannabis users is associated withnormal hippocampal volumes relative to users exposedto THC, but not CBD.
18This suggests that CBD maybe neuroprotective, perhaps through its role in synapticplasticity and/or neurogenesis. Animal studies have alsoshown CBD to reverse THC-induced spatial memorydeﬁcits,
19conditioned place aversion,20and decreasedsocial interaction (for a review, see Refs.
12,21), and im-portantly, to increase hippocampal cell survival and neu-rogenesis.
22Administration of pure compounds tohumans showed that CBD produces opposite effects toTHC in the nature of regional brain activation
23andacute exposure to CBD ameliorates cognitive andpsychotic-like symptoms induced by THC in cannabisusers.
24Despite promising evidence of the therapeuticeffects of CBD, no study to date has examined the poten-tially restorative effects of prolonged CBD administra-tion to cannabis users.This study is the ﬁrst investigation of potential thera-peutic effects of prolonged daily administration of CBDt or e g u l a rc a n n a b i su s e r su sing a pragmatic open-labeldesign, wherein cannabis users maintained their natural-istic use of cannabis. On the basis of reviewed literature,we focused on symptoms of depression, trait anxiety, andpsychosis-proneness,4,25,26and cognitive performancewithin the domains of attention/executive function andlearning and memory, being the most sensitive to the del-eterious effects of chronic cannabis use.
5We hypothesizedthat prolonged administration of CBD would improvepsychological functioning and cognitive performance inregular cannabis users. We had noa priorihypothesisregarding the effects of prolonged CBD exposure onongoing patterns of cannabis use, since potentiallydiminished effects of THC could either result in areduction or an increase in cannabis use if its rewardingeffects are mitigated.
Materials and MethodsParticipants
Twenty cannabis users, recruited by advertising, partic-ipated in this*10-week pragmatic open-label clinicaltrial. Inclusion criteria required participants to haveused cannabis at least monthly for 6 months (the ma-jority vastly exceeded this criterion; Table 2). Followinga telephone screen and a subsequent face-to-face semi-structured interview (as previously used in our stud-ies
27,28), participants were excluded for any lifetimehead injuries requiring hospitalization, neurologicalconditions, current psychiatric medication, and cur-rent psychiatric diagnoses(personal, or ﬁrst-degreerelative for psychotic disorders) or alcohol dependenceassessed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiat-ric Interview—MINI Plus.
29Participants were also ex-cluded based on self-reported history of regular otherillicit drug use (>once/month for>6 months in thepast 3 years); occasional recreational use (<once/month) was not an exclusion criterion. Participantswere not required to alter their usual patterns of canna-bis use; however, they were requested to abstain fromother drug use throughout the trial (self-report corrob-orated by weekly urine drug screen) and from cannabisand alcohol for at least 12 h before baseline (BL) andpost-treatment (PT) test sessions. Participants werefamiliarized with study procedures before providingwritten informed consent at each testing session andreceived incremental reimbursements for participation(completion total of AU$650). The study was approvedby the University of Wollongong and IllawarraSolowij,et al.; Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research 2018, 3.1 http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/can.2017.0043 22
 Shoalhaven Local Health District Health and MedicalHuman Research Ethics Committee and registered asa clinical trial (ISRCTN89498802).
Procedure
The trial was conducted over 12 weeks, comprising2 days of BL assessments, 10 weeks (on average) ofdaily CBD administration, face-to-face weekly moni-toring, and provision of CBD capsules, and minimum12-h washout of CBD, cannabis, and alcohol before2 days of PT assessments. The 2-day sessions occurredmostly consecutively (maximum 1 week apart; CBDadministration maintained for PT sessions) and con-sisted of structured interview, and clinical, cognitive,electroencephalogram (EEG), and magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI) assessments (EEG and MRI outcomeswill be reported elsewhere). Speciﬁcally, beyond tele-phone screening, the BL assessment at the Universityincluded the following: (1) consent signing; (2) our cus-tomized semistructured interview
27,28to further assessdemographic information, detailed history of currentand previous cannabis and other licit and illicit sub-stance use, and cannabis-speciﬁc measures of withdrawal(Cannabis Withdrawal Scale; CWS),
30dependence(Severity of Dependence Scale; SDS),
31–33and (retrospec-tively) experiences while intoxicated (Cannabis Experi-ences Questionnaire; CEQ)
34,35; (3) the MINI Plus toscreen for psychiatric disorders, and a range of scalesto assess symptoms of depression, anxiety, mood, andpsychosis liability, and global functioning (as primaryoutcome measures—see section, ‘‘Psychological symp-tom, cognitive and substance-related measures’’); (4)the vocabulary and matrix subscales of the WechslerAbbreviated Scale of Intelligence

Par-ticipants then proceeded to cognitive testing and theEEG session, with an MRI session on the second day.PT assessments were near identical, excluding onlythose assessments required to be taken once (e.g., de-tailed history and height).Follow-up telephone assess-ments occurred 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months aftercompletion of the trial to monitor any withdrawal symp-toms experienced as a result of ceasing CBD treatment,general physical and mental well-being, and any changesto substance use.
Psychological symptom, cognitive and substance-related measures.
The primary outcomes of this studywere psychological symptom and cognitive outcomes.Table 1 provides a full listing of study measures andtheir schedule of administration. To assess changes inpsychological symptoms following CBD treatment, par-ticipants completed self-administered questionnaires re-lated to depressive (Beck Depression Inventory; BDI37), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory
38; STAI-I stateand STAI-II trait), and psychotic-like (CommunityAssessment of Psychic Experiences; CAPE
39)s y m p -toms at BL and PT, and overall functioning (GlobalAssessment of Functioning; GAF,
40and Social Occu-pational Functioning Assessment Scale; SOFAS

CBD administration and weekly monitoring. At BLand each weekly session, participants received 28gelatin-coated capsules containing 50 mg of 99.5%pure crystalline CBD (of herbal origin) solved inMiglyol 812 and Softisan 378 (Trigal Pharma Ltd; asubsidiary of the BioSynthesis Pharma Group Ltd).Participants were instructed to swallow 4 (50 mg) cap-sules per day (2 in the morning and 2 in the evening,spaced to optimize steady-state plasma concentra-tions), equating to 200 mg/day CBD. This dose was se-lected as a ‘‘medium’’ level dose based on the range oftherapeutic doses reported in human studies (e.g.,‡800 mg/day in psychotic individuals
44,45), and forcaution since no previous study had administered pro-longed and relatively high doses of CBD to ongoingcannabis users. Participants received an SMS text mes-sage (morning and evening) reminding them to taketheir capsules. At each weekly session, participantsreturned any unused capsules and were given a newbottle containing 28 capsules for the following week.Adherence was measured by the number of capsulesreturned and participants reported the times of anymissed doses. Heart rate and blood pressure were mea-sured; no signiﬁcant variations occurred over thecourse of the trial (data not reported). Blood samplesand urine samples (for drug screens and pregnancytesting in females—an exclusion criterion) were takenweekly. Plasma was analyzed by LC-MS/MS for canna-binoid (CBD, THC, and THC metabolite) concentra-tions.
46Urine samples were subjected to ProScreen/C212 Dip Tests to corroborate self-reported abstinencefrom drugs other than cannabis. All BL and PT urinesamples, and a random selection of samples providedweekly during the trial proceeded to urinary drugscreen testing (total 98 urine samples analyzed; 5 sam-ples per participant on average).
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 24.0.Primary outcome measures were change from BL toPT in BDI, STAI-II, and CAPE (positive, negative,and depressive psychotic-like symptoms) scores, inperformance on the RAVLT and AST, and in cannabis,tobacco, and alcohol use measures. Signiﬁcant changewas assessed by paired samplet-tests, or Wilcoxonsigned-rank tests for non-normally distributed data.Outcomes were further explored by group: heavy ver-sus light users according to median split on lifetimeoccasions of use, and dependent versus nondependentusers according to cutoff scores on the SDS (‡3)47at BL, by repeated-measures ANOVA (rmANOVA) fortime by group interactions (with covariates as required),or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for skewed data. Spear-man’s correlations explored associations between BLand PT scores or change scores in psychological symp-toms, cognitive performance, cannabis use measures,CBD dose consumed (self-report), and plasma CBDconcentrations (mean, maximum, ﬁnal week of trial,and assessment day).
ResultsParticipant characteristics, patterns of cannabis use,medication adherence, and plasma cannabinoidconcentrations
Demographic and substance use measures for the over-all sample are provided in Table 2. Participants weremostly young adult males (median age 25; 4 females)and the majority had completed some tertiary educa-tion. They were using cannabis on a median 25 days/month and had been using regularly for a median of5.5 years. The majority refrained from other illicitdrug use during the course of the trial, with one excep-tion: one participant self-reported using LSD, ecstasy,ketamine, mushrooms, or mescaline on multiple occa-sions during the trial; none of these drugs were detectedin urinary drug screens and the self-reported use wasnot alerted by the participant to the research teamuntil the trial was completed. Since this was a natural-istic study of cannabis users in the community, and theparticipant was not an outlier on any measure, his datawere retained in the analyses reported in this study.Dependent users did not differ from nondependentusers in years of regular use or lifetime occasions ofuse (although the latter was marginal atp=0.054,with 8 heavy and 4 light users in the dependentgroup and 2 heavy and 6 light in the nondependentgroup). Dependent and nondependent users also didnot differ in cumulative quantity of cannabis (cones),alcohol (standard drinks), and tobacco (cigarettes) con-sumed over the weeks of the trial (calculated fromSolowij,et al.; Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research 2018, 3.1 http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/can.2017.0043 24
 weekly TLFB interviews) (allp>0.08). Only cumulativecannabis use differed between heavy and light users, asto be expected (median 1064 vs. 120 cones,p=0.003; allotherp>0.075).The prolonged CBD treatment was well-toleratedwith no adverse effects during the trial or in the follow-up period, including no withdrawal symptoms orchanges in cannabis or other drug use after ceasingCBD treatment. Ten weeks of daily CBD treatmentwas planned and completed by most participants, miss-ing only occasional doses. However, in this pragmaticcommunity trial, a range of participant-related issues(e.g., work commitments and scheduling difﬁcultieswith PT appointments) resulted in one participantcompleting only 5.5 weeks of CBD treatment, whilefour participants continued to take CBD for 11–12weeks to ensure PT sessions were conducted after asimilar washout period for all participants (‡12 hafter the last CBD capsule was consumed; median15 h; range 12–23 h). Participants reported consuminga median of 258 capsules over the course of the trial(range 154–334), resulting in a total median dose of12,900 mg CBD (range 7700–16,700 mg) over a median10 weeks, with median adherence to consuming the200 mg daily dose of 93.16% (range 68.67%–99.35%; me-dian daily dose 200 mg; mean daily dose 184.05 mg, SD13.99).Average plasma CBD concentrations across the trialare shown in Figure 1, demonstrating relative achieve-ment of stable concentrations, although with much in-dividual variability as expected for metabolism of thiscompound following oral administration. No CBDwas detected in plasma at BL. Figure 1 also displaysconcentrations of plasma THC and THC metabolites,and Table 3 provides the weekly data across the trialfor each compound. Interestingly, average weeklyplasma CBD concentrations were positively correlatedwith average weekly plasma THC-COOH concentra-tions (r=0.65,p=0.017). Plasma CBD concentrationswere not signiﬁcantly correlated with self-reporteddose of CBD consumed; Figure 1 nevertheless showsa trend toward a relationship. Plasma CBDTable 2.

 concentrations did not differ between heavy and lightcannabis users, but dependent users had signiﬁcantlylower mean (10.11 ng/mL vs. 21.26 ng/mL;p=0.006)and maximum plasma concentrations (median 19.45vs. 66.80 ng/mL;p=0.002) than nondependent users,despite not differing in self-reported total CBD doseconsumed (p=0.97). Subsequent analyses of symptomsand cognition by group used rmANCOVA with meanplasma CBD concentrations and cumulative cannabisuse measures from across the trial as covariates.Cannabis frequency and quantity measures did notchange signiﬁcantly from BL to PT (allp>0.14). How-ever, there was a signiﬁcant decrease in CEQ euphorialevels reported to be experienced after using cannabis(p=0.001 in the overall sample; no time by groupinteractions,p=0.005 after cumulative cannabis use in-cluded as covariate), and many participants self-reported feeling less high when they smoked cannabisover the course of the trial. No other CEQ measureswere altered signiﬁcantly from BL to PT, nor were mea-sures of severity of dependence on cannabis (SDS) orwithdrawal from abstaining for at least 12 h beforeeach test session (CWS). There were no signiﬁcantchanges in tobacco or alcohol use from BL to PT.AUDIT scores marginally reduced overall (p=0.055)and signiﬁcantly in dependent users (BL 9.08 vs. PT7.25) relative to nondependent users (BL 8.13 vs. PT8.13) (time by group:p=0.095;p=0.043 with covari-ates). SDS scores appeared to reduce in dependentusers (BL 5.01 vs. PT 4.50) and increase in nondepen-dent users (BL 0.88 vs. PT 1.38), but the interaction wasnot signiﬁcant (p=0.20).
BL to PT differences in psychological symptoms
Table 4 reports psychological symptom measures at BLand PT for the overall sample. Severity of depressivesymptoms (BDI) was signiﬁcantly lower at PT thanat BL (p=0.017) (Fig. 2 depicts a linear decrease overthe weeks of the trial;r=/C00.78,p=0.003). Participantsalso reported signiﬁcantly fewer positive psychotic-likesymptoms (CAPE-positive symptom frequency, p= 0.025) with lower levels of associated distress (CAPE-positive symptom distress,p=0.022) at PT. Reductionin positive symptom frequency remained signiﬁcantafter cumulative cones of cannabis smoked across thetrial was included as a covariate (p=0.014). Therewere trends toward decreased overall symptom fre-quency and distress (CAPE total frequency,p=0.056;total distress,p=0.051). In contrast, state anxiety in-creased PT relative to BL (STAI-I,p<0.015). NoTable 3.

 changes were observed for trait anxiety, global or social,and occupational functioning (Table 4). These resultssuggest that prolonged CBD treatment may improvedepressive and positive psychotic-like symptoms inregular cannabis users.No signiﬁcant time by group interactions were ob-served on any measure when comparing groups ofheavy and light users with or without cumulativecones smoked across the trial as a covariate. However,in nonparametric tests for non-normal variables, onlyheavy users showed a signiﬁcant reduction in depres-sive symptoms (median BL 3.0 vs. PT 0.0; Z=2.53, p=0.011), while light users showed signiﬁcant reduc-tion in CAPE-positive symptom distress (BL 8.5 vs.PT 2.5,Z=2.05,p=0.041).Dependence status was far more sensitive to the ef-fects of CBD treatment; signiﬁcant time-by-group in-teractions were observed for CAPE total frequency(p=0.018;p=0.044 with covariates) and distressscores (p=0.016;p=0.026 with covariates), andCAPE-negative frequency (p=0.002;p=0.004 withcovariates) and distress scores (p=0.002;p=0.007 withcovariates), with dependent users showing greater reduc-tion in symptoms than nondependent users (Fig. 3).CAPE-depressive symptom frequency scores showed asigniﬁcant reduction from BL to PT (p=0.025), whichdid not interact with group. Dependent users showed sig-niﬁcant reduction in BDI scores (median BL 4.0 vs. PT1.0;Z=2.82,p=0.005) and CAPE-positive symptom dis-tress (BL 5.5 vs. PT 3.0;Z=2.11,p=0.035), with nochange observed in nondependent users. Furthermore,only dependent users showed an increase in state anxietyat PT relative to BL (median BL 23.5 vs. PT 30.5;Z=/C02.19,p=0.028). As shown in Table 5, at BL, depen-dent users had signiﬁcantly higher scores than nonde-pendent users on the BDI and on CAPE total andCAPE-negative symptom frequency scores, and sig-niﬁcantly lower GAF and SOFAS scores. At PT,dependent users differed signiﬁcantly only on theGAF. These data support the evidence in Figure 3 ofgreater potential efﬁcacy of CBD treatment in depen-dent users (who may have had more room to move)than in nondependent users, closing the gap betweenthese groups.

 being the key outcome measure from the AST (Cam-bridge Cognition Ltd, 2017). Switching cost (the latencydifference between switching and nonswitching blocks)was lower at PT than BL (p=0.028). There were notime-by-group interactions for any AST variables. Pre-vious research has demonstrated a practice effect on theAST for switch errors and incongruent errors.
48No sig-niﬁcant change was observed on these variables fromBL to PT (bothp>0.34), arguing against a practice effectin this study, and indeed negative correlations were ob-served with plasma CBD concentrations, indicatingfewer errors PT with higher plasma CBD (rhorange/C00.40 to/C00.58,prange 0.08 to 0.007).
Association between plasma CBD concentrations,patterns of cannabis use, and changes inpsychological symptoms and cognitive performance
C h a n g e si nc a n n a b i su s ep a t t e r n s ,B D Is c o r e s ,a n dRAVLT performance were not associated with plasmaCBD concentrations. Changes in CAPE total dis-tress (rho=0.47,p=0.037; Fig. 4), negative symptomfrequency (rho=0.54,p=0.015), and distress scores(rho=0.63,p=0.003) were signiﬁcantly correlated withmaximum plasma CBD concentrations. CEQ Psychoticchange scores correlated with total dose of CBD reportedto have been consumed (rho=0.51,p=0.022), but notwith plasma concentrations. Mean, maximum, or ﬁnalweek plasma CBD concentrations were negatively corre-lated with PT state anxiety and change in state anxietyscores—the higher the average plasma concentration,the greater thereductionin state anxiety (rhorange/C00.48 to/C00.62,prange 0.033 to 0.004) (even though PTstate anxiety levels were elevated relative to BL). Thisimplies that higher doses of CBD may alleviate anxiety,but lower doses of CBD may potentially elevate state anx-iety (Fig. 4), although this requires replication. No associ-ations were observed for trait anxiety, which was theprimary focus of this study, as many confounding factorscould account for changes ins t a t ea n x i e t y .B o t hB La n dPT severity of cannabis dependence (SDS) scores werenegatively correlated with mean, maximum, and ﬁnalweek plasma CBD concentrations—the higher the plasmaCBD, the lower the SDS score (rhorange/C00.43 to/C00.72, prange 0.056 to 0.0003), with stronger associations at BLthan at PT (Fig. 4), but change in severity of dependencewas not correlated with plasma CBD concentration.AST switching cost was signiﬁcantly negatively cor-related with plasma CBD concentrations on the day oftesting (rho=/C00.61,p=0.006; Fig. 2) (indicating thathigher plasma CBD was associated with less variationin latencies between switching and nonswitching trials;i.e., less cost), as was response latency in switchingblocks (rho=/C00.45,p=0.051; strengthening after re-moval of one outlier:rho=/C00.50,p=0.036), which
also correlated with mean (rho=/C00.55,p=0.012)and maximum (rho=/C00.53,p=0.016) plasma CBDconcentrations. There was no evidence that better func-tioning people may have taken more capsules, as therewere no associations between these AST measures atBL and plasma concentrations attained in the trial.There were no associations between AST measuresand hours since last CBD dose, indicating that im-proved performance was not due to the acute effectsof CBD. In contrast, hours since last CBD dose did cor-relate with postinterference (rho=/C00.53,p=0.029)and delayed recall (rho=/C00.55,p=0.022) on theRAVLT PT, and with change in delayed recall fromBL to PT (rho=0.50,p=0.041), suggesting that acuteeffects of CBD may contribute to improved memoryfunction.Table 5.

 Discussion
This is the ﬁrst study to report the effects of a pro-longed course of daily administration of CBD to canna-bis users in the community. Ten weeks of 200 mg oralCBD daily was well tolerated, with no side effects dur-ing or after completion. In this pragmatic trial, the can-nabis users were not seeking treatment and continuedtheir regular pattern of cannabis use during the trialwithout restriction. Of note, signiﬁcant reductionsin depressive and psychotic-like symptoms were ob-served, along with improvements in cognition, fromBL to the end of treatment.Caution must be observed in interpreting the results ofthis open-label trial, as it was not placebo controlled andgiven the exploratory nature of our analysis. As such, theoutcomes may be confounded by a range of bias, expec-tancy, and practice effects. Nevertheless, the ﬁndings sug-gest that CBD treatment may confer beneﬁts to mentalhealth and cognitive function that are likely CBD treat-ment speciﬁc, as correlations were observed with plasmaCBD concentrations. Furthermore, these beneﬁcial out-comes were observed in the context even of ongoing can-nabis use. Within a treatment setting for cannabis usersseeking to reduce their cannabis use, adjunct use of CBDalongside psychological treat m e n t sf o rc a n n a b i sd e p e n -dence may confer even greater beneﬁts. This premise isbased on the following predicates: (1) the cannabisusers of this study reported experiencing less euphoriawhen they smoked cannabis, both subjectively through-out the trial and as measured by the CEQ. While
FIG. 4.Associations between plasma CBD concentrations, symptoms, and dependence.Solowij,et al.; Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research 2018, 3.1 http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/can.2017.0043 32
 cannabis use in this study neither increased in compen-sation, nor decreased, in a treatment-seeking sample mo-tivated to reduce or stop using, provided with supportivepsychological treatment, the reduced euphoria may facil-itate disincentive to continue using; (2) greater beneﬁcialeffects of CBD were observed in dependent than nonde-pendent users. This result speaks to the likelihood thatCBD confers greater therapeutic effects in a diseasestate/compromised brain. For example, we recentlyreported therapeutic neuroprotective effects of CBDin a preclinical model of schizophrenia, where CBDhad no effect on cognition or social interaction (the neg-ative symptoms of schizophrenia) in control animals.

Similarly, in this study, cannabis users likely to have acannabis use disorder (based on SDS cut-off score‡3) showed signiﬁcantly greater reduction in symptomsa n di m p r o v e dc o g n i t i o nt h a nnondependent users. Inter-estingly, both severity of dependence on cannabis andAUDIT scores tended to decrease in dependent usersonly. Dependent users also appeared to absorb or metab-olize CBD differently to nondependent users, yet thetherapeutic effects of CBD held after controlling fortheir lower mean plasma CBD concentrations.

We acknowledgelimitations regarding self-reported medication adherencein terms of interpreting the altered metabolism apparentin dependent users and we were unable to assay CBDmetabolites in this study; these would be informative infuture prolonged administration studies.Together with our previous ﬁndings suggesting protec-tion of brain harms by CBD,
18the current data providehope that even if cannabis users do not cease to use can-nabis in the course of psychological interventions for can-nabis dependence, adjunct treatment with CBD mayminimize any further harm from continued use. It maybe that the greatest efﬁcacy would be achieved withCBD treatment alongside abstinence from cannabisuse. Ascertaining the efﬁcacy of CBD treatment in ab-stinent, dependent users is an important avenue for fu-ture research. There was little in the literature to guidethe dose of CBD employed in this protocol, and weopted for a conservative/cautious dosing regimen forthis ﬁrst-of-kind study. Further dose-ﬁnding studiescould manipulate not only the daily dose and its regi-men (morning and evening dosing) but also the dura-tion of treatment; we chose 10 weeks of treatmentfor logistic and feasibility optimization purposes. Thiswas deemed long enough on the basis of other pharma-cological clinical trials more generally, to show changein symptoms and cognition, but not so long that signif-icant attrition or nonadherence to trial inclusion crite-ria might manifest (e.g., excess other drug use). Futurestudies might also examine a range of other cognitive,clinical and brain functional outcome measures.Although our ﬁndings require replication in a largersample placebo-controlled trial, the potential for CBDtreatment to reduce psychological symptoms andimprove cognition in cannabis users, and be further de-veloped as an adjunct to psychological treatments forcannabis dependence, appears very promising.Acknowledgments

  Monash journalism’s Christiane Barro has won the first back-to-back Walkleys for the 2018 Walkley Student of the Year award. Christiane, a reporter with The New Daily who finished her journalism training at Monash last year, was recognised for her exclusive investigation into the underground medical cannabis industry. Walkley judges said her body of work was “the result of many months of research and clearly illustrated her commitment to exposing suppliers who were preying on the vulnerable”. “Barro’s strong news sense is matched with her ability to write incisively, with impact and sensitivity,” the judges wrote. Christiane said she was “very grateful” to win her consecutive Walkley award. “Thank you to the many sources who trusted me with their story,” Christiane said. “And thank you to the research facility who went above and beyond to assist the investigation. And, of course, thank you to both Monash University and The New Daily for the support.” Monash journalism student Selby Stewart was a finalist in the Walkley Student of the Year award for his outstanding work published in the Sunday Herald Sun and Mojo News. Selby's articles included “Hoods on violent rampage” “Rooming-house closures not the answer, experts say” “Fred Negro’s St Kilda”. Master of Journalism student Amber Schultz was the co-winner of the Jacoby-Walkley Scholarship for her brilliant work as The Struggle presenter and her reporting for The Age newspaper. Benjamin Ansell, a University of Melbourne student, was also acknowledged for his initiative and impressive work as a young journalist. Amber said the scholarship award was a great opportunity to learn from the “best and the brightest in the industry”. “I can't wait to spend 14 weeks across Channel 9 and the Walkley Foundation and learn more than I possibly ever could,” she said. Amber’s advice for journalism students is to create opportunities in the field and make it happen. “Don't wait for an opportunity to fall into your lap,” she said. “Go out and seize it and apply for every internship advertised at Monash, join Mojo and absolutely utilize the staff at Monash because they are amazing. They are there to help.” Acting head of journalism Associate Professor Johan Lidberg congratulated Monash’s “remarkable students Christiane and Amber”. “Their Walkley wins illustrate the calibre of the Monash journalism students and the quality of our student publication Mojo News,” Lidberg said. “Christiane's back to back win of the Walkley Student Journalism of the Year award is particularly impressive – a Walkley first in this category.” Associate Professor Lidberg said these awards took the total tally of Monash journalism students' wins and highly commended in various national journalism awards to 35 since 2009. “This is an important external measure of the quality of the journalism produced and taught in the School of Media, Film and Journalism at Monash as the awards are judged by industry panels,” he said. “These wins would not have happened without our deeply dedicated journalism teaching and support staff and the fact that Monash University decided to invest $3 million in the Monash Media Lab creating a home for Mojo News. “Christiane's and Amber's names will be added to the awards honour roll in the lab news room. You're an inspiration to current and future journalism students and proof that the next generation of journalists will do great things.” Monash lecturer and Mojo staff editor Corinna Hente said she was incredibly proud of both Amber and Christiane, who had both held key roles in Mojo.  “Amber is just a force of nature. She has talent, works hard and has that unmistakable presence on camera, which is a powerful combination,” Ms Hente said. “What she has achieved with her TV satirical talk show The Struggle is remarkable. “Christiane is one of the best student journalists Monash has ever had. The quality and depth of her work, and the importance of it, is beyond question.”   STUDENT JOURNALIST OF THE YEAR Christiane Barro, Monash University and The New Daily“The cannabis oil ‘healers’ preying on Australia’s sick and dying”, “Contaminants detected in unlicensed cannabis oil products”,  “‘It’s a disgrace’: Senator requests complete overhaul of medicinal cannabis regulator”  JACOBY-WALKLEY SCHOLARSHIP","Jul 19, 2018 ... ... journalism training at Monash last year, was recognised for her exclusive investigation into the underground medical cannabis industry.",9,691

Building on the recent literature on hurdle and double-hurdle models, wepropose a double-inflated modelling framework, where the zero observations areallowed to come from the following: nonparticipants; participant misreporters (whohave larger loss functions associated with a truthful response); and infrequent con-sumers. Due to our empirical application, the model is derived for the case of anordered discrete-dependent variable. However, it is similarly possible to augmentother such zero-inflated models (e.g., zero-inflated count models, and double-hurdlemodels for continuous variables). The model is then applied to a consumer choiceproblem of cannabis consumption. We estimate that 17% of the reported zeros in thecannabis survey are from individuals who misreport their participation, 11% frominfrequent users, and only 72% from true nonparticipants.

1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Recreational drug use is one of the major social problems that policymakers face across the world, being associated with crime,violence, and more importantly, adverse health consequences. To this end, there exists a vast literature concerned with theempirical modelling of a wide array of data on drug use to help inform policymakers. Research on drug use and its consequenceshas arisen from several disciplines. Drug users' behaviour has been studied extensively in psychology, sociology, and medicalarenas. In the last few decades, economists have also shown a growing interest in the study of drug use and its consequences.They have brought unique and useful perspectives to the understanding of drug users' behaviour, the onset of drug use, andabuse prevention, all of which have made important contributions to the drug policy debate. Crucial to effective policy analysisis the scope and quality of the drug data.The availability of individual/household-level drug data has brought an improved understanding of consumer behaviour.The analysis of differential policy responses by demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, and ethnicity, has been veryuseful for the development of drug policies and other educational programmes. Such data are invariably collected using survey

techniques. The accuracy of the information gathered is dependent on reliable and accurate responses by the respondents. Itmay be the case, however, that respondents have an incentive to misreport their drug consumption given that drugs, in particularthose of an illicit nature, are associated with legal risks, as well as stigma, or social disapproval. Such misreporting may leadto information being misclassified in survey data, which can mask the incidence of such behaviours and lead to biased andinconsistent estimates in statistical analyses (Hausman, Abrevaya, & Scott-Morton, 1998). With an increasing use of surveydata for drug policy analysis, it is therefore crucial to explore the incidence and implications of misreporting.Although survey misclassification or misreporting (in the case of drugs and in general) is known to be pervasive and to poten-tially bias statistical/econometric analyses, there is a limited body of research that have explicitly modelled such behaviours.The relevant studies on misclassified dependent variables include Hausman et al. (1998), Abrevaya and Hausman (1999),Lewbel (2000), and Dustmann and van Soest (2001). Hausman et al. (1998) use a parametric approach to estimate misclassifica-tion probabilities when the functional form of the distribution of the error term is known. They consider a binary choice modelwith two types of misclassification: the probability that the true 0 is recorded as a 1; and vice versa. Abrevaya and Hausman(1999) and Lewbel (2000), on the other hand, consider a semiparametric approach to estimate the misclassification probabili-ties, where the distribution of the error term is unknown, except that the latter allows the misclassification probabilities to becovariate-dependent functions. Dustmann and van Soest (2001) and, more recently, Greene, Harris, and Hollingsworth (2015)extend the parametric model of Hausman et al. (1998) to ordered data.More recently, researchers such as Mahajan (2006), Hu (2008) and Molinari (2008) have attempted to model misclassifi-cation in discrete-dependent variables using a secondary measurement or an instrument to identify a nonlinear model. Theirapproach is based on the observation that in the presence of classification errors, the relation between the true variable and itsmisclassified representation is given by a linear system of simultaneous equations in which the coefficient matrix is the matrixof misclassification probabilities. The so-called anchoring, focal point answers, and crude rounding in surveys have also been asubject of interest among researchers (Kleinjans & van Soest, 2014; Manski & Molinari, 2010; van Soest & Hurd, 2012). Using arandom-effect multinomial logit model, Kleinjans and van Soest (2014) explicitly account for such reporting behaviour includingnonresponse where respondents decide not to report any value. Finally, anchoring vignettes have also been used to measure dis-crepancies in reporting behaviours, particularly in the case of self-reported health and life satisfaction (Kristensen & Johansson,2008; van Soest, Delaney, Harmon, Kapteyn, & Smith, 2011); however, vignettes are very rare in most mainstream data sets.This paper makes an important contribution to this received literature. The main aim is to develop a latent-class or partialobservability-type modelling approach to analyse the extent of misreporting in drug consumption information collected usinga large national drug survey. Our particular interest lies in misreporting in the context of cannabis consumption. However, thetechnique will also be generally applicable to empirical health models, such as sexual health and mental health, that involvesensitive responses and where there is a potential for inaccurate measurement of the variable(s) of interest. Essentially, weassume that for a “sensitive” response variable (such as drug use), there is an associated loss-function (either perceived or actual,social and/or legal) involved for the individual in terms of the responses he/she reports. Here, it is clear that the researchermust be aware of the potential for misreporting. For example, there will be a strong incentive for individuals to misreport(presumably under-report) their true consumption levels for fears of legal (and/or moral) repercussions (see, e.g., Pudney, 2007).This typically gives rise to a preponderance of “zero” observations in the data set.There is a suite ofhurdleanddouble-hurdlemodels that have been developed over the years to address the build-up of “zero” observations where the response variable is either a continuous variable with a nonzero probability mass at (typically,but not exclusively) zero levels (Cragg, 1971; Jones, 1989; Smith, 2003), or a count variable (Greene, 1994; Heilbron, 1989;Lambert, 1992; Mullahy, 1986; 1997; Pohlmeier & Ulrich, 1995), or an ordered discrete variable (Harris & Zhao, 2007).For example, in the zero-inflated ordered probit ( ZIOP) model, Harris and Zhao (2007) consider ordered levels of tobacco consumption and argue that the reported zeros could arise from both nonparticipants and infrequent consumers. In the samespirit, following the standard double-hurdle arguments, we suggest that the build-up of “zero” observations may correspondto both nonparticipants and participant (but infrequent) consumers. However, for these “social bads” with associated reportingloss-functions, we also suggest a third source, involving those participants who, potentially due to fear of repercussions, reportzero-consumption when this in fact is not so.This concept can be applied to the range of models mentioned above that exhibit a preponderance of zeros such as thezero-inflated Poisson,ZIP, and other double-hurdle model(s). Here, in view of our application to illicit drug use recordedon an ordinal scale, we focus on aZIOPmodel; although the techniques can be similarly applied to other statistical models. Explicitly, we propose a three-tiered approach: the first equation determines the participation decision; the second conditional on participation, determines whether an individual misreports; and finally, the third, for participants who report accurately ,a n ordered probit model determines the levels of consumption, which also include zero consumption of infrequent users. We termthis generalisation of theZIOPmodel, the doubleZIOP(DZIOP) model. In research in areas of discrete random variables that are inherently ordered, misreporting has sometimes been addressed by allowing the model's inherent boundary parameters to 374 GREENE ET AL.
vary by observed personal characteristics (Greene & Hensher, 2010). Here, in addition to the “fundamental” form of modellingmisreporting, we can also allow for more general under- (or over-) reporting, by allowing the boundary parameters to vary byobserved characteristics.
2 THE ECONOMETRIC FRAMEWORK2.1
ADZIOPmodel
Our approach entails a fundamental form of modelling the misreporting, which is likely to be present in data that are perceivedto embody a strong loss-function (social and/or legal) for the individual. Following the ZIOPmodel of Harris and Zhao (2007), we start by defining a discrete random variable ythat is observable and assumes the discrete ordered values of 0,1,…,J.A standardOPapproach would map a single latent variable to the observed outcome yvia so-called boundary parameters, with the latent variable being related to a set of covariates (Greene & Hensher, 2010). However, the ZIOPmodel involves two latent equations: a probit selection equation and an OPequation. As with the more traditional double-hurdle models (Jones, 1989), individuals here have to overcome two hurdles before one observes nonzero consumption: whether to participate, and then,conditional on participation, the amount to consume, which also includes zero consumption . However, it is our contention here that, especially regarding the consumption of “social bads” (e.g., licit and, in particular,illicit drugs), participants may intentionally misreport their true consumption patterns. In particular, we hypothesise that a(probably significantly large) proportion of participants may under-report their true consumption levels by simply stating zeroconsumption. That is, we contend that, for example, if a user is concerned with legal ramifications of admitting drug use, he/shewill typically prefer to misreport “none at all,” as compared to simply under-reporting their true use. The alternative assumptionwould be akin to someone feeling more comfortable to admitting breaking the law “by just a little.”Finally, participants who do not misreport, as with the ZIOPmodel, are free to select any of thej=0,…,Joutcomes. In this way, observed zero-consumption can arise from the following: (a) nonparticipants; (b) participants who misreport; or(c) participants who do not misreport, but who are infrequent consumers (e.g., who happen to not have used drugs in thepast 12 months). Thus, as compared to say, a standard OPapproach, the zero observations are “double-inflated”: once by nonparticipants and then by misreporters. We suggest a three-tiered sequencing of decision making. First, the individual makesa decision whether to participate or not; secondly, there is the decision to misreport or not; and finally, there is the decision onhow much to consume.Following Harris and Zhao (2007), we let rdenote a binary variable indicating the split between Regime 0 (with r=0f o r nonparticipants) and Regime 1 (withr=1 for participants). Although unobservable, ris related to a latent variabler

J−1⩽̃y∗, (4) where𝜇is a vector of boundary parameters to be estimated (the extreme values,𝜇
0and𝜇J, are normalised at 0 and+∞, respectively). Of course, as with theZIOPmodel,̃yis not directly observed. Nor is eitherrorm. Here, the observability criterion for observedyis y=r×m×̃y. (5) An observedy=0 outcome can arise from three distinct sources: r=0 (the individual is a nonparticipant);r=1 (the individual is a participant) and jointly thatm=0 (the individual is a misreporter); and finally, that jointly r=1,m=1, and̃y=0( t h e individual is a zero consumption, accurate-reporting participant). In the same way, to observe a positive y, we require jointly that GREENE ET AL. 375
the individual is a participant(r=1)and an accurate reporter(m=1)and that̃y∗>0. This setup is one of partial observability in line with models proposed by Poirier (1980) and Meng and Schmidt (1985).For the time-being, assume that the stochastic terms𝜺(=𝜀
r,𝜀m,𝜀y)are independent and follow standard Gaussian distribu- tions. The full probability fory=0i sg i v e nb yPr(y=0|x)=Pr(r=0|x)+Pr(r=1|x)Pr(m=0|x)+Pr(r=1|x)Pr(m=1|x)Pr(̃y=0|x) (6)and for the remaining outcomesPr(y=j|x)=Pr(r=1|x)Pr(m=1|x)Pr(̃y=j|x)
(j=1,…,J).(7) By independence, these joint probabilities are simply products of the marginals such that, under the usual assumption ofnormality, they are given respectively by Pr(y=0|x)=[1−Φ(x

(8)The probability of a zero observation has been “double-inflated” as it is a combination of the probability of “zero consump-tion” from theOPprocess and the probability of “nonparticipation” from the split probit model plus that from misreporting.Note that as per theZIOPmodel, there may or may not be overlaps with the variables in the partitions in x

2.2 Generalising the model to correlated disturbances ( DZIOPC)
As described above, the observed realisation of the random variable ycan be viewed as the result of three separate latent processes with uncorrelated error terms. However, these three outcomes correspond to the same individual, so it is likely that thevector of stochastic terms𝜺

3 AN APPLICATION TO CANNABIS CONSUMPTION
Cannabis use imposes a high social and economic cost on society and has been a major concern to policy-makers worldwide. It isthe most commonly used drug after tobacco and alcohol, particularly in the younger population. A large amount of public fundshave flowed into promotional campaigns and rehabilitation programmes in many countries across the world in order to treat andprevent cannabis-related harm. This has resulted in a growing importance of research in order to develop sound policies andstrategies. The quality of the evidence from these scientific investigations is an important concern, however. Because cannabispossession and market transactions constitute illegal activities in most jurisdictions, there is a strong incentive for cannabis usersto conceal their behaviour, for fear of punishment. The concealment of cannabis use can also result from embarrassment orsocial disapproval (Swadi, 1990). Such misreporting can have a significant impact on the quality of research findings. A majorfocus of this paper therefore is to examine the profile of those people who misreport their cannabis consumption.
3.1 The data
The data we use for the model are drawn from the Australian National Drug Strategy Household Survey, which is a nationallyrepresentative survey of the noninstitutionalised Australian civilian population aged over 14 providing information on druguse patterns, attitudes, and behaviour (NDSHS, 2010). A multi-stage, stratified area sample design ensured a random sampleof households in each geographical stratum. As mentioned above, there has been some discussion in the existing literatureregarding the potential for misreporting to be influenced by how the survey is conducted. The earlier waves of the National DrugStrategy Household Survey used face-to-face and drop-and-collect methods to collect data. The computer-assisted telephoneinterview (CATI) method of data collection was introduced in the 2001 survey. In that particular survey, all three methods wereemployed to collect data. The 2004 and 2007 surveys, on the other hand, were administered using only the drop-and-collect andCATI methods, whereas the more recent surveys were conducted only using the CATI method.We restrict our study to the 2001, 2004, and 2007 surveys for the following reasons. The older surveys included inconsistentquestions with regard to the key variable of interest, whereas the more recent surveys were conducted using only the CATImethod. As discussed later in the paper, variation in the method of collection is key to identifying the misreporting equation.Definitions of all variables used in the study are given in the Appendix. A sample of 50,153 individuals is thus available forestimation. This data set has been used in several previous studies (see, e.g., Cameron & Williams, 2001; Harris & Zhao, 2007;Williams, 2004; Zhao & Harris, 2004).In this data set, neither the monetary expenditures on nor the physical quantities of cannabis consumed are reported. Theinformation on individuals' consumption of cannabis is given via a discrete variable measuring the participation and intensity ofconsumption in the last 12 months. In particular, the information in the data concerning an individual's consumption of cannabis
3We evaluate these trivariate probabilities using the GHK simulator. GREENE ET AL. 377
is collected through the question “Have you used cannabis/marijuana in the last 12 months ”a n d“In the last 12 months, how often did you use cannabis/marijuana?”, where the responses to the frequency of use take the form of one of the following choices:not at all(y=0);using cannabis once or twice a year(y=1);using cannabis monthly or every few months(y=2); andusing cannabis everyday or once a week(y=3). In terms of explanatory variables, we have three blocks: x
r, to determine participation;x m, for misreporting; andx y,t od e t e r - mine consumption levels. Although many of the variables overlap (as we have no ap r i o r iinformation as to where they should appear in the model and where not), to facilitate identification, we apply some natural exclusion restrictions. The commonvariables in the three equations include a wide range of personal and demographic characteristics, namely, gender; marital sta-tus; individual's (standardised) age; a dummy variable for whether there are preschool children in the household; whether theindividual comes from a single parent household; a dummy variable for whether the individual resides in a capital city; and adummy variable for whether the individual is of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander origin.We also control for educational attainment, distinguishing between four categories of highest educational attainment: a tertiarydegree; a nontertiary diploma or trade certificate; year 12 education; and less than year 12 education, which is the omittedcategory. Illicit drugs are just market commodities, and users are just market participants. In terms of the individual's economicsituation, we control for the household annual income before tax measured in Australian dollars using eight income bands asdescribed in the Appendix, with the highest band being the omitted category. Although income may act as a social class proxyin the participation and misreporting decisions, the amount of consumption is likely to be directly related to the level of incomeas it is with any normal good. We also use individual's main labour market status to control for their economic situation, thatis, employed, studying, unemployed, and other activities such as retired, on a pension or performing home duties, which formthe omitted category.The criminal justice environment is an important determinant of drug participation and consumption. At the same time,it also increases the incentive to misreport. For instance, the fear of punishment may be heightened if users perceive thatsupplying accurate information could lead to legal repercussions. Australia has long-standing laws with regard to cannabisdecriminalisation. South Australia was the first jurisdiction to implement an expiation system for minor cannabis offences in1987. Under this scheme, simple cannabis offences such as possessing or cultivating small amounts for personal use are subjectto minor penalties, although the sanctions for commercial dealings are rather significant. Similar expiation systems have sincebeen introduced in other Australian states and territories, and yet, others have been gradually easing their laws against cannabisconsumption in recent years. We therefore include in all three equations a variable to represent the decriminalisation status ofcannabis use across the various Australian states and territories. We also control for any migration effect by using an indicator forwhether the individual has migrated to Australia in the last 10 years. Any time trend in participation and levels of consumptionis addressed using time indicators for the surveys.Although the inherent nonlinearity in our model can help achieve identification, we impose exclusion restrictions to ensurethat the model is identified on data.
4We therefore include additional explanatory variables in the participation equation, which we believe do not directly influence misreporting behaviour. In particular, drug culture or peer drug use has been identified as animportant risk factor for drug participation (see, e.g., Delaney, Harmon, & Wall, 2008; Kenkel, Reed III, & Wang, 2002; Pudney,2004). We therefore include the variable “peer” in x
rthat represents the proportion of the individual's friends and acquaintances that use cannabis. This variable is excluded from the misreporting equation. Given evidence on the gateway effect of alcohol toharder drugs such as cannabis (Pacula, 1998) and the association between body piercing and tattoo procedures with risk-takingbehaviours (see, e.g., Deschesnes, Finès, & Demers, 2006; Heywood et al., 2012), we also include in x
rdummy variables indicating whether an individual started drinking alcohol at a young age (i.e., below the legal age of 18 years), and whetherthe individual has ever undergone a body piercing procedure or a tattoo procedure. These risk indicators are not expected toinfluence individuals' misreporting behaviour. We also include year dummies in x
randx yto represent any trend changes over time. Finally, an individual's attitude towards drug laws is very likely to influence his or her consumption. We thus include adummy variable inx
randx y, which takes the value 1 if the individual believes that a small quantity of cannabis for personaluse should be a criminal offence, and 0 otherwise. These regressors are also excluded from x
m. We also use some exclusion restrictions to help identify the misreporting equation by including some variables exclusivelyinx
m. Following the previous literature, these mostly relate to the conditions under which the survey was administered, andtherefore may potentially influence the extent to which individuals misreport, but not their participation or consumption levels.Specifically, we control (using indicators) for the following: if anyone else was present when the respondent was completing thesurvey questionnaire (“present”); if anyone helped the respondent complete the survey questionnaire (“help”); and the surveyformat (“survtype”; which takes a value 0 if the drop-and-collect method was used and takes a value 1 if the CATI or face-to-face
4For identification by functional form and related issues, see, for example, Li, Poskitt, and Zhao (2016). 378 GREENE ET AL.
method was used). These variables conform with the factors that have been associated with misreporting or misclassificationin prior studies (see, e.g., Berg & Lien, 2006; Hoyt & Chaloupka, 1994; Kraus & Augustin, 2001; Lu, Taylor, & Riley, 2001;Mensch & Kandel, 1988; O'Muircheartaigh & Campanelli, 1998), although none of these studies have modelled misreportingexplicitly. We also include as an instrument a variable indicating a general lack of trust in the survey, which we proxy by thepercentage of compulsory questions left unanswered in the survey. Note that nonresponse rates in general with regard to theresponse variable were very low (under 2%), such that this is not likely to adversely affect our approach and/or findings.Finally, in terms of consumption levels, a standard consumer demand framework applies with special characteristics foraddictive goods (see, e.g., Becker & Murphy, 1988). We thus include standard demand-schedule own and cross-drug pricesinx
y. Other than cannabis price, we control for the price of a range of related drugs such as amphetamines, cocaine, heroin,alcohol, and tobacco, in light of the evidence that certain drugs act as either complements or substitutes to cannabis (see, forexample, Cameron & Williams, 2001; Ramful & Zhao, 2009; Zhao & Harris, 2004).Price series for cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, and heroin are obtained from the Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS)(NDARC, 2009). They vary across Australian states and territories and by year. The IDRS collects such data predominantly frominterviewing injecting drug users and key informants who have regular contact with illicit drug users but which may potentiallyexhibit coverage error (NDARC, 2009). In occasional cases where a price report is missing, it is constructed using informationfrom the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, which was replaced by the Australian Crime Commission in recent years.The Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence/Australian Crime Commission is an alternative source for drug prices, whichcollects information on drugs through covert police units and police informants (ACC, 2010).The advantage of using price data from the IDRS is that they are provided with unified measures and fewer missing obser-vations. To be specific, the price of cannabis is measured in dollars per ounce, and the respective price(s) of amphetamines,cocaine and heroin are measured in dollars per gram. The data on alcohol and tobacco prices are obtained in the form of indicesfrom the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS, 2010). All price and income series are deflated using the all-items ConsumerPrice Index (CPI) for individuals' respective states of residence. Clearly dependent upon the particular price series, there is apotential for measurement error here (especially with regard to the illegal drugs).Table 1 presents some summary statistics on the observed cannabis consumption. On average, around 89% of individualsidentify themselves as current nonusers. Given the way the survey questions are asked, these self-identified nonusers or thebuild-up of zero observationswill include genuine nonusers, recent quitters, infrequent users who are not currentlyconsuming cannabis, and potential users who might use when, say, the price falls. More importantly, these self-identified nonusers mayinclude misreporters who, out of embarrassment, social disapproval, and/or fear of repercussions, may prefer to identify them-selves as nonusers, for example. Given (a) that users have incentives to misreport consumption and (b) that for users who reporttruthfully, the choices of consumption intensities are ordered, then this presents a good case for the DZIOP(C)model(s) in order to identify the different types of zero observations and their potentially differing driving factors. Note that there is also the pos-sibility of over-reporting, particularly with regard to the intensity of consumption (possibly due to memory issues). However,there is evidence that over-reporting is rarely a problem when analysing self-reported drug use (see, e.g., Swadi, (1990), andreferences therein).
3.2 The results
Table 2 reports the estimated coefficients of the DZIOPCmodel. In particular, we report three sets of results corresponding to the three equations: participation, truthful reporting, and levels of consumption. Note that out of three correlation coefficients,only𝜌
12(i.e., the correlation between the participation and misreporting equations) is strongly statistically significant (althoughthe joint Likelihood Ratio test only marginally fails at 10%).

Turning firstly to the results relating to participation, we find that, consistent with existing evidence, increasing age, beingmarried, living in a capital city, and being a new migrant decrease the probability of participation. On the other hand, beingmale, having started drinking at a young age, having a tattoo or body piercing, and being of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanderbackground are associated with higher participation (see, e.g., Cameron & Williams, 2001; Deschesnes, Finès, & Demers, 2006;Ramful & Zhao, 2009; Saffer & Chaloupka, 1999). In terms of education, we find those with higher qualifications are morelikely to report participation. However, we do not find evidence of labour market status or income effect on participation. Con-sistent with the literature, cannabis use among peers and the decriminalisation laws also have a positive impact on participation(see, e.g., Cameron & Williams, 2001; Delaney, Harmon, & Wall, 2008; Farrelly, Bray, Zarkin, & Wendling, 2001; Kenkel,
5Nonetheless, we present the correlated DZIOP results as they are essentially the same as the uncorrelated ones. GREENE ET AL. 379

Reed III, & Wang, 2002; Pudney, 2004; Saffer & Chaloupka, 1999), although support for tighter drug laws is negatively relatedto participation.Focusing on the misreporting equation, we find that age, being male, and living in a capital city are associated with a higherprobability of truthful reporting whereas individuals from a single-parent household and of aboriginal status are more likelyto misreport. Interestingly, we find higher level of education to be also associated with a higher probability of misreporting. 380 GREENE ET AL.

Although we might expect decriminalisation to increase honest reporting in light of reduced legal implications, it is neverthelessassociated with higher probability of misreporting (presumably this variable is capturing other state/time effects not controlledfor elsewhere).In terms of the instruments in the misreporting equation, all four of them are statistically significant and negative. Theresults suggest that the presence of another person during the completion of the survey, or the provision of assistance GREENE ET AL. 381
during such, increases the probability of misreporting. Similarly, the CATI and face-to-face methods of interview (relative todrop-and-collect) also increases the probability of misreporting. Finally, if the individual demonstrated a lack of trust in thesurvey by, in general, refusing to give a response, he or she also had a higher probability of misreporting.With respect to the levels of consumption, we find that being male, of aboriginal descent and being unemployed, all havestatistically significant positive effects. Similarly, having started drinking at a young age, having a tattoo or body piercing, andpeer drug use are also positively related to levels of drug consumption. According to the rational addiction model by Becker andMurphy (1988) , drug users are rational, forward looking utility maximizers who base consumption decisions on full knowledgeof the consequences of addiction. Current consumption by a young adult raises the user's marginal utility of future use but alsoreduces the overall utility in the future, given that the rational user takes account of the addictive properties of drugs and theirimplications for future health and wealth. We thus allow for this nonlinear age-consumption relationship through a quadraticspecification for age.

Our results indeed show evidence of an inverted U-shaped distribution of levels of consumption with age. In other words,at both ends of the age distribution, individuals are associated with lower levels of consumption. Having young children inthe household, being employed or a full-time student, and having higher qualifications are all associated with lower levels ofconsumption. Although we do not find evidence of any significant impact of household income on participation or misreporting,we observe a general decline in the levels of use in the highest income groups.Considering the price variables in the consumption equation (which act as identifying variables here), we find that the priceeffect of cannabis is positive and significant. It is important to note that the price of cannabis is strongly associated with quality(see, e.g., Cameron & Williams, 2001; Williams, 2004), and because we are unable to control for the price variation due toquality, a positive price effect could well be picking up the drug quality effect on participation. This counter-intuitive priceeffect is, however, also found for several competing models (such as the generalised ordered probit [ GOP] and correlated ZIOP [ZIOPC]; see Table 3 and the following section) and is therefore not an adverse finding of the current approach per se. The levelof cannabis consumption is also responsive to heroin and speed prices suggesting that cannabis is an economic substitute toheroin but a complement to speed. However, the price effects of cocaine, tobacco, and alcohol are all statistically insignificant. Insummary then, with at least two price variables exhibiting high levels of significance and along with similarly strong identifyinginstruments in the participation and misreporting equations, we are overall confident in our model results.
3.3 Partial effects
As with any probability model, partial effects are generally more informative than coefficients. There are several sets of partialeffects that may be estimated here. For example, one may be interested in the partial effects of an explanatory variable onprobabilities such as the probability of participation, Pr(r=1), the probability of misreporting,Pr(m=0), the probabilities for the levels of consumptionconditionalon participation,Pr(̃y=j|r=1), and the overall probabilities for different levels of consumption,Pr(y=j).In particular, we are interested in the probability of reporting zeros, as this forms the major contribution of our approach. Thepartial effect on the overall probability of observing zero consumption, Pr(y=0), is the sum of the effects on the probabilities of the three types of zeros; that is, the probability of nonparticipation, the probability of misreporting, and the probability ofzero-consumption arising from participants who are infrequent or potential consumers. Note that the explanatory variables ofinterest may appear in only one or two ofx
r,xm,a n dx y, or in all three. For comparison purposes, in Table 3, we also present results from aGOPmodel without any hurdles, where the boundary parameters are specified as a function of variables in x
m
that do not appear inx y. Standard errors of the partial effects for all models are obtained using the Deltamethod (Greene, 2008), and the effects themselves were computed numerically.We report the partial effects onPr(y=0)(estimated at sample means) coming from these three sources in the corre- latedDZIOPCmodel in Table 3. For a further comparison, we also compare these results with partial effects estimated fromaZIOPCmodel that allows zero observations to come from two distinct sources: nonparticipation and infrequent consump-tion/misreporting; and, as noted, from a GOPmodel that does not explicitly model zero observations coming from different sources but allows for the boundary parameters inherent in the OPmodel to be a function of thezero-generatingvariables.
7For theDZIOPCmodel, the overall partial effects are decomposed in three parts: nonparticipation, Pr(r=0), with clearlypartic- ipationbeing the mirror image of this; participation and misreporting, Pr(r=1,m=0); and participation, truthful reporting,
6Ideally, this theory would be tested using panel data. Unfortunately, we have to proxy this within a cross-sectional approach.
7Specifically, we allow the boundary or threshold parameters of the OP model, which are generally constants in a standard OP, to be a function of instrum ents that we used in the misreporting equation. 382 GREENE ET AL.TABLE 3 Partial effects for selected models

and zero consumption,Pr(r=1,m=1,̃y=0). In contrast, we have two components in the ZIOPCmodel: nonparticipation, Pr(r=0); and participation and zero consumption, Pr(r=1,̃y=0). Interestingly, we observe some important differences across the estimates from the alternate models for some explanatoryvariables such as living in a capital city, household income, and education. A key example is the effect of education. The ZIOPC model indicates that those with higher qualifications have a lower probability of nonparticipation but a higher probability ofparticipation with infrequent consumption. With an additional misreporting dimension in the DZIOPCmodel, we find that those with higher qualifications also have a higher probability of misreporting. For instance, from the ZIOPCresults, relative to those with less than year 12 qualifications, degree holders have a 2.0 percentage point (pp) lower probability of being anonparticipant and a 1.6 pp higher probability of being a participant with zero consumption, resulting in an overall 0.4 pp lowerprobability of observing zero consumption. The DZIOPCresults, in contrast, indicate that degree holders have a 2.6 pp lower probability of being a nonparticipant, a 1.1 pp higher probability of being a participant with zero consumption and also a 0.6pp higher probability of being a misreporter. Overall, degree holders have a 0.9 pp net negative effect on the probability ofobserving zero consumption relative to those with less than year 12 qualifications. Finally, basing policy advice on the GOP model results, one would conclude that education has no impact on cannabis consumption, presumably with the opposing effectsbeing cancelled out.The effect of decriminalisation also highlights the potentials of the DZIOPCmodel. For instance, theGOPindicates that decriminalisation does not affect consumption. From the ZIOPCmodel, we find that decriminalisation is associated with higher probabilities of participation, whereas the DZIOPCsuggests that an easing of the criminal justice system is actually associated with both a higher probability of participation and a higher probability of misreporting.In short, as a result of comparisons of models that ignore any potential misreporting effects, it appears that such models resultin biased estimates of various quantities of interest, and potentially erroneous policy advice.
3.4 Robustness checks
There may be concerns that certain control variables may be endogenous and/or that some of the instruments we use to identifythe model in various equations may have effects elsewhere in the model.
8In this section, we perform a robustness check to test whether our results change significantly with the exclusion of the so-called problem variables and alternate specifications.We look at four different specifications that we compare with our main one: Spec 1 – we enter price variables in both theparticipation and the consumption equations; Spec 2 – we run the main specification without tattooandbody piercing;S p e c 3 – we run the main specification without peer influence; and Spec 4 – we run the main specification with only survey typeand trustas identifying variables in the misreporting equation.Comparing across the resulting partial effects, we find that the results are generally robust to the various specifications(Table 4). For example, the partial effect of male is−0.025 from the main model. This effect varies between−0.023 and−0.030 across the four alternative specifications. Similarly, the partial effect of having a degree varies in the range −0.004 to−0.009, comparable with the estimated partial effect of−0.009 from the main model. With regard to the results for the respective misreporting equations, the results essentially remained unchanged (and are available on request).Different specifications for the misreporting equation were also experimented with; for example, it could be argued that thepeer influenceandsupport for criminalisationvariables also affect the misreporting process. These results are not presented here (and are available on request), but again essentially did not significantly affect the overall results. Although we argue abovethat a positive effect of own-price on consumption levels might be picking-up quality effects, it could also be argued that thereis a potential for reverse causation here. The same arguments could be made about the findings with regard to decriminalisation.In light of this, we also experimented with replacing these variables with both year and state dummies. Again, although notpresented here, once more, the general results were not unduly affected.We note here that there is also information available in the data regarding lifetime cannabis use and also use in the last month.One would expect misreporting levels to be less for the former and stronger for the latter (Brown, Harris, Srivastava, & Zhang,2017). However, unfortunately, these are simple zero/one responses, so that they do not fit into the framework proposed inthis paper.
8Although we note that the important variables that identify the misreporting equation are all survey-related, which make them unlikely to be related to drug consumption, providing a strong ground for identification, the importance of these factors in the misclassification literature and their statisti cal significance in the estimated model lend further support to their inclusion in the misreporting equation. However, testing the validity of instruments in nonlinear models is a difficult task (see, e.g., Davidson & MacKinnon, 1993). 384 GREENE ET AL.TABLE 4 Comparison across specifications

Finally, although we do report the results for reasons of space, we also conducted a series of Monte Carlo experiments basedon the empirical data and specification used in the paper. In short, the model performed extremely well (with regard to estimatingall key quantities of interest) under a range of scenarios and did not suggest any identification issues. A strong finding was that itappeared most important to ensure identifying variables in the misreporting equation. Another very strong finding, on the otherhand, was that the restricted submodels(OP,GOP,ZIOP)yielded heavily biased estimates of some key quantities of interest.
3.5 Predicted probabilities
A key output from such a model relates to summary predicted probabilities especially with regard to the zeros. Thus, there areseveral predicted probabilities that will be of interest with the DZIOPclass of models. For example, one may be interested in the partial probability of participation, Pr(r=1). In terms of misreporting, one may be interested in the partial probability of misreporting,Pr(m=0); or the joint probability of participation and misreporting, Pr(r=1,m=0); or the probability of truthful reporting, conditional on participation, Pr(m=1|r=1). Similarly, there is a range of probabilities one may be interested in predicting levels of consumption. However, our main interest in this paper is on the misreporting dimension. Therefore, togain insight into the sources of the observed zeros, we present in the first row in Table 5 the predicted probability (averagedacross all individuals) of the zeros and its three respective components (using the equations presented above): nonparticipation,misreporting, and zero consumption. We find that the overall predicted probability of 88.8% of observed zero consumptionin the population is made up of the respective probability of 81.5% nonparticipation, 4.4% misreporting, and 2.9% infrequentconsumption.Such probabilities can be thought of as prior probabilities. That is, they apply to a randomly selected individual from thepopulation, about whom we know nothing except for their characteristics. However, to provide further insights into the extentof misreporting, it is possible to estimate posterior probabilities, analogous to those considered in latent class models (Greene,2008) that are conditional on the outcome chosen by the individual. This specifically allows us to make a prediction on whatpercentage of these zeros come from nonparticipation, misreporting, and zero consumption, respectively, using all the informa-tion we have on the individual. It therefore attempts to answer the following question: given that an individual recorded a zero, what is the probability that he/she is a true non-participant or a misreporting participant or an infrequent consumer (giventheir observed characteristics)?The posterior probabilities for the three types of zeros are given as (Greene, 2008):Pr(r=0|x,y=0)=f(r=0|x)

Note that we have used the uncorrelated DZIOP model in the above. Note also the above probabilities are all conditional ony=0. As a result, the numerator on the right-hand side of all three equations should be joint probabilities with y=0. For example, the numerator in Equation 13 is strictly f(r=0,y=0|x). However, this can be simplified as above given y=0w h e n r=0. The same applies in the other two equations given y=0w h e nm=0o rw h e ñy=0. From Table 5, we find that about 72% of the reported zeros come from genuine nonparticipation, 17% from those who havemisreported their participation, and 11% from zero consumption participants (estimated individually and averaged across).Moreover, the small estimated standard errors on these quantities is an indication that they have been estimated relativelyaccurately. These are important findings suggesting that misreporting and infrequent users reporting zero consumption in surveydata with a fixed time frame (12 months here) may lead to considerable underestimation of drug use prevalence.
3.6 Conclusions
When modelling “social bads”, such as illegal drug consumption, researchers are often faced with a dependent variable char-acterised by a large number of zero observations. Such zero observations could result from individuals misreporting activitiesregarded as being socially undesirable, illegal, or which are associated with perceived social stigma, as is the case withdrug-consumption. The accuracy of the information gathered from surveys is therefore crucially dependent on the respondentsproviding reliable and accurate responses. If not, important behaviours will be misclassified thereby masking the true incidenceof such. Thus, if ignored, misreporting potentially leads to inaccurate estimates of the prevalence of such behaviours and ulti-mately may lead one to question the validity of any conclusions drawn on the basis of these, which in turn raises concerns as tohow useful such data actually is to policy-makers.Building on the recent literature on hurdle and double-hurdle models, we propose a double-inflated modelling framework,where the zero observations are allowed to come from the following: nonparticipants; participant misreporters (who have largerloss functions associated with a truthful response); and infrequent consumers. Due to our empirical application, the modelis derived for the case of an ordered discrete dependent variable. However, it is similarly possible to augment other suchzero-inflated models (e.g., zero-inflated count models, and double-hurdle models for continuous variables). The model is thenapplied to a consumer choice problem of cannabis consumption.Overall, the results suggest that misreporting has a significant effect on the incidence of cannabis use. Specifically, the poste-rior probability of misreporting cannabis participation is estimated at 0.17. In other words, out of all the reported zeros, 17% canbe accounted to misreporting. The model also predicts that 11% of the reported zeros for cannabis use are from infrequent userswith zero consumption (“corner solution” individuals), and only 72% are from true nonparticipants. The modelling frameworkalso provides important insights into the drivers of misreporting in surveys compared to more standard modelling techniques.For example, a zero effect in a simple model might well disguise significant composite effects that simply net each other out.Interestingly, the findings also suggest that the extent of misreporting is influenced by how the survey was administered as wellas factors such as the presence of other individuals when the survey was completed, and the individual's general trust in suchsurveys. In order to enhance accuracy of information gathered from surveys, it is therefore important to pay attention to theconditions under which the survey data are collected. The findings suggest that accounting for misreporting is important in thecontext of using survey data related to sensitive activities, especially where such data are used to inform public policy.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe kindly acknowledge funding from the Australian Research Council and the Bankwest Curtin Economic Centre, CurtinUniversity.

This study assessedthe spatial distribution of medical marijuana dispensaries according to estimated marijuanademand, socioeconomic indicators, alcohol outlets and other socio-demographic factors.Method— Telephone survey data from 5,940 residents of 39 California cities were used toestimate social and demographic correlates of marijuana demand.

Medical marijuana use has been permitted in California since 1996 (California PoliceChiefs' Association [CPCA], 2009), however medical marijuana dispensaries continue toattract substantial opposition. The US Department of Justice lists marijuana as a prohibitedSchedule 1 substance (Drug Enforcement Agency, 2011), and its Drug Enforcement Agencyperiodically raids dispensaries and prosecutes operators (Linthicum & Blankstein, 2012).Besides the moral and ethical debate about the drug itself, much of the public discoursecenters around unresolved questions on the relationships between marijuana dispensaries,marijuana laws, crime (Kepple & Freisthler, 2012), and patterns of marijuana use (Harper,Strumpf, & Kaufman, 2012; Wall et al., 2011, 2012). In this study, we examine the locationof dispensaries in communities, with reference to predictions from economic geography andprior observations of other legal drug markets.Medical marijuana dispensaries are a new point of supply for a potentially addictivesubstance. Their location within communities is important because the presence of adispensary exposes the local population to increased access to marijuana, and possibly toproblems related to outlet operations (CPCA, 2009). Availability theory suggests thatincreased access will lead to increased use among the local population (Stockwell &Gruenewald, 2004), and such an effect has been demonstrated in alcohol markets(Gruenewald, 2011). Wall and colleagues (2011, 2012) found higher proportions ofmarijuana users in states with medical marijuana laws compared to states without such laws;whereas Harper, Strumpf and Kaufman (2012) found no such relationship in a replicationstudy. A recent study found a cross sectional association where cities with greater density ofmarijuana dispensaries had more individuals who used marijuana and more frequent use ofmarijuana by those individuals (Freisthler & Gruenewald, 2013), though causation isunknown.Regarding problems related to outlet operations, the small body of existing literaturecontains mixed findings. Crime rates in the immediate vicinity of dispensaries differaccording to the security measures implemented by operators (Freisthler, Kepple, Sims, &Martin, 2012). However, there is no association between the density of dispensaries andviolent or property crime in Sacramento, California (Kepple & Freisthler, 2012). Opponentsof medical marijuana often assume that dispensaries have a detrimental impact oncommunities in a similar manner to alcohol markets (CPCA, 2009). Longitudinal studieshave shown that increased alcohol outlet density is associated with increased assaults(Gruenewald & Remer, 2006; Livingston, 2008), motor vehicle crashes (McMillan, Hanson,& Lapham, 2007; Ponicki, Gruenewald, & Remer, 2013), intimate partner violence(Cunradi, Mair, Ponicki, & Remer, 2012; Livingston, 2011), and child abuse and neglect(Freisthler, Gruenewald, Remer, Lery, & Needell, 2007; Freisthler & Weiss, 2008). To date,no such studies of the neighborhood effects of marijuana dispensaries have been published.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript It is unclear if dispensaries have a similar negative impact on communities to alcoholoutlets.Despite these concerns, no studies have attempted to describe the location of dispensarieswithin communities. Theoretical models from economic geography make clear predictionswhich fill that void (Aoyama, Murphy, & Hanson, 2011; Hanson, 2005; Harris, 1954). The2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimated that 40.4% of US residents aged12 and over had ever used marijuana, and 10.2% had used the drug in the previous 12months (United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2007). In order tomaximize market share and reduce convenience costs for these potential customers, outletswill open in response to demand. Competition will encourage agglomeration (Hotelling,1929), as will zoning restrictions, local ordinances, and wholesale transportation costs.Therefore, dispensaries should be found concentrated in and near areas of high marijuanademand.Further theory from urban economics (O'Sullivan, 2007) suggests that income is also likelyto be associated with dispensary location. High housing value tends to exclude retail space(DiPasquale & Wheaton, 1992), and outlets with a demonstrable or perceived associationwith social, environmental or public health problems are excluded from stableneighborhoods that possess the resources to resist their establishment (Skogan, 1990). Thus,dispensaries will likely be located in areas of social disadvantage.Also of note is the well-documented intersection between the location of drug markets,greater numbers of alcohol outlets, social disadvantage and the presence of other problems(Banerjee et al., 2008; Gruenewald, Millar, Ponicki, & Brinkley, 2000; LaVeist & WallaceJr, 2000; Livingston, 2012; Romley, Cohen, Ringel, & Sturm, 2007; Zhu, Gorman, & Horel,2006). However, the potential spatial relationship between marijuana dispensaries andalcohol outlets is unclear. It is possible that dispensaries are excluded by the well-resourcedalcohol industry which would seek to protect itself against potential associations with drugmarkets (Skogan, 1990). Conversely, zoning restrictions and reduced convenience costs forconsumers may have the result that alcohol outlets and marijuana dispensaries are co-locatedwithin neighborhoods (Aoyama et al., 2011). In either scenario, it is necessary to includealcohol outlets in economic geography models.The aim of this study was to determine predictors of marijuana dispensary location withincommunities. Based on the theory presented above, we hypothesized that dispensaries wouldbe located in and near to areas of high marijuana demand and away from high income areas.Given the possible association with alcohol outlets and the influence they may exert on thesocial ecology of marijuana dispensaries, we also examined the spatial relationship betweenthese two types of businesses. Our results are interpreted in the context of medical marijuanaas an emerging legal drug market.METHODSThis study used two main data sources: (1) person-level data were used to generate estimatesof marijuana demand for each Census block group, then (2) Census block-group level data

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript were used to investigate the location of dispensaries according to market potential,socioeconomic indicators, alcohol outlets and other covariates.Person-Level DataStudy Sample— This study used data from a cross-sectional computer assisted telephone(CATI) survey conducted in 50 moderately sized California cities in 2009. Of the 138municipalities in the state with between 50,000 and 500,000 residents, a sample of non-contiguous cities was purposively selected based on geography and ecology in order tomaximize generalizability to non-sampled cities (Paschall, Grube, Thomas, Cannon, &Treffers, 2012; Thompson, 1992). A response rate of 48.0% was calculated using standarddefinitions from the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AmericanAssociation for Public Opinion Research, 2002). There were 8,553 respondents in theoriginal sample, but for the current study, we excluded responses from 1,986 (23.2%) whoresided in the eleven study cities without marijuana dispensaries (see Census-Based Datamethods, below). Of the remaining 6,567 surveys, a further 627 (9.5%) had incompleteresponses for the variables of interest and were omitted from the analyses; of these, 600(95.7%) were due to non-responses to a single household income item.Measures— Marijuana use was collected in the telephone survey as self-reported days ofuse in the last 12 months (range: 0 to 365). Demographic variables were structured tocorrespond with US Census data, and were included in the model based on priordemonstrations of an association with marijuana use (Galea, Ahern, Tracy, & Vlahov, 2007;Kerr, Greenfield, Bond, Ye, & Rehm, 2007; Paddock et al., 2012; Tucker, Pollard, de laHaye, Kennedy, & Green, 2013). Variables included gender, race/ethnicity (Non-HispanicWhite, Non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and Asian), annual household income ($20,000 orless, $20,001 to $60,000, $60,001 to $100,000, ≥ $100,000), age (20 to 29, 30 to 39, 40 to49, ≥ 50 years) and employment status (full time employed, unemployed or laid off).Highest level of education was coded as high school (or GED), college or technical school,and postgraduate or medical school. We were unable to include a geographic variable (i.e.city of residence) as the low number of marijuana users made the city level estimatesimprecise. To avoid multi-colinearity, excluded categories were age 18 to 19, education lessthan high school or GED, income < $20,000 and other ethnicity.Census-Based DataStudy Sample— We used Census 2000 block group (BG) data for areas within and aroundthe study cities. We preferred this spatial unit to other Census based geographies (e.g.blocks, tracts) because BGs are the smallest unit for which the demographic data werequired are available, and larger units may not capture the hypothesized excluding effect ofhigh local income. Forty-three of the 50 cities had an ordinance prohibiting medicalmarijuana dispensaries. In order to account for dispensaries located immediately outsidethese jurisdictions that service the city populations, block groups were included in thesample that had an internal centroid within a 3 mile buffer of the defined city boundaries.Buffers were set at 3 miles as this was considered a reasonable travel distance from the cityboundary. Eleven cities did not have any dispensaries within their city boundaries or bufferregions. These cities could not be included in the multi-level model, so were excluded from

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript the sample. In all, the sample contained 7,538 block groups in 39 cities with a total 2009population of 12,946,683. There were 151 block groups that were in the buffer regions oftwo study cities, so the total number of block groups included in the models was 7,689. Ofthe 1,384 BGs in the buffer region, 1,359 (98.2%) were in unincorporated areas (i.e. withlocal administration performed by the county, rather than a city government).Measures— The dependent variable of interest was the presence a marijuana dispensarywithin a block group. Dispensaries were located by a team of trained research assistants bycombining seven different online directories of dispensaries and official lists from localjurisdictions. Of the 1,664 active dispensaries identified in California (current at April 23,2012), 505 were located within the sample region.Demographic data were extracted at a block group level using 2009 estimates (GeoLyticsInc., 2010), including sex, ethnicity, age, employment status, education, and medianhousehold income, population density, and the proportion of residents living under 150% ofthe poverty line. We preferred these annual estimates to the five-year moving average of theAmerican Community Survey or the Census. There is no evidence of systematic bias in theGeolytics data, so any error would increase background noise, thereby attenuating ourresults towards the null. Other covariates were an indicator of whether the BG centroid wasin a buffer region rather than the city itself and alcohol outlet density. Alcohol outlet datawere measured as the density of licensed venues per square mile, based upon 2009 liquorlicense data from the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. Outlets werecategorized as bars/pubs (ABC license types 23, 40, 42, 48, 61, and 75), restaurants (41 and47) and off-premise outlets (20 and 21). We constructed variables for the proportionsalcohol outlets that were (i) bars/pubs and (ii) off premise outlets (i.e. liquor stores) and (iii)restaurants. To avoid colinearity, the third variable of this triplet was omitted, with the effectthat the comparison group for the proportion bars/pubs and off-premise variables was theproportion of restaurants.Statistical AnalysisWe used a censored regression model (Tobin, 1958) to predict days of marijuana use peryear for individuals according to the demographic independent variables from the telephonesurvey. The model accounted for left (< 0 days) censoring.Marijuana Demand— Demand for marijuana per Census block group was approximatedby estimating the market potential within each geographical unit (Brakman, Garretsen, &van Marrewijk, 2009). First, in Equation 1, the predicted mean days of marijuana use perblock group (y) was calculated by summing the constant term (b 0) plus the proportion of thepopulation with the demographic characteristics included in the TOBIT model ( pc),multiplied by the b-coefficient from the TOBIT model output ( bc).

Then, for each block group a standard normal distribution (z) was calculated where μ wasthe block group mean, σ was the censored regression model sigma, and the intercept (x) wasMorrison et al. Page 5

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript zero. The probability that mean days of marijuana use (q) among residents of block group(a) was greater than zero is 1 minus the standard normal Cumulative Density Function ( ϕ) ofx.

We then estimated the mean days of marijuana use (x) among all marijuana users per blockgroup. Where ϕ(t) is the standard normal Cumulative Density Function, the mean of atruncated standard normal distribution is (Barr & Sherrill, 1999):
(3)
Finally, in Equation 4, market potential (d) per block group (expressed as aggregated days ofmarijuana use per person per year; hereafter, person-days) is equal to the predicted meandays of marijuana use among all marijuana users (x) in that block group, multiplied by theprobability that mean days of marijuana use within a block group is greater than zero (q) andthe population size of the block group (n):

Multi-level Models— The final step used multi-level Bayesian spatial logit models todetermine the likelihood of a dispensary being located within block groups nested withincities. This construction controls for two forms of non-independence among BGs withincities. The multi-level aspect accounts for the expectation that BGs from the same city willbe more similar to each other than they are to BGs from other cities, and the conditionalautoregressive (CAR) priors allow the possibility that individual BGs will be more similar totheir neighbors than they are to distant block groups (i.e. spatial autocorrelation).The general form of the multilevel model was used where y was the outcome measure ofinterest (i.e. presence of a dispensary) measured at the block group level:
(5)
β0 is a city-specific intercept and u 0 is the random city-specific residual component, suchthat β0 + u 0 can be thought of as representing adjusted city-level means on the outcomevariable. βa are regression coefficients expressing the associations (slopes) betweenpredictors (x) for block groups (a) and the outcome. θa and α are random effects whichcapture spatially unstructured heterogeneity and CAR spatial dependence respectively.Four variants of this multilevel model were estimated. Model 1 estimated marijuana demandas the sole level 1 variable (i.e. a basic economic geography model). Model 2 separateddemand into its component parts (population size and estimated per capita marijuana use) todetermine the main contributors of any relationship between demand and dispensarylocation. Model 3 further expanded demand into population size and its socio-demographicMorrison et al. Page 6

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript components (sex, ethnicity, age, employment status, education, and median householdincome). Model 4 was the final multivariable analysis. Because demand was calculated afunction of BG socio-demographics, it was not possible to include both the socio-demographic variables and the demand variable in the same model due to multi-colinearity,so demand replaced its component parts in this model. Besides controlling for demandwithin a given block group, the model allows for effects of demand averaged over adjacentblock groups as well as city-wide demand (calculated as the sum of person-days for BGswithin each city). City-specific random effects were included in the models, however in theinterest of brevity these were suppressed from the table.The individual-level censored regression model was performed using STATA v10.1(StataCorp, 2007). Geoprocessing was completed with ArcGIS v 10.1 (ESRI, 2011), and theblock-group multilevel Bayesian models were estimated using WinBUGS v.4.3.1 (Lunn,Thomas, Best, & Spiegelhalter, 2000). Uninformed priors were specified for all randomeffects. Trace plots showed that all parameters in all four models had stabilized andconverged after a 2,000 iteration Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) burn-in. Two chainswith different initial values were used in each model. Posterior estimates were sampled for20,000 iterations to provide model results.RESULTSCharacteristics of the survey respondent group are shown in Table 1, and the results of thecensored regression model are shown in Table 2. Very few people in the sample reportedusing marijuana in the last 365 days (5.9%). Whites ( = 73.6 [95%CI = 18.4,128.8]), men(70.0 [42.8, 97.2]) and people aged 20 to 29 (82.1 [35.0, 129.2]) used marijuana on moredays than the comparison group (i.e. women, aged 18 and 19, “other” ethnicity, householdincome < $20,000). Older adults (> 50 years) were likely to report less marijuana use, aswere Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic respondents. McFadden pseudo-R2 was very low(0.039), indicating that the covariates in the model accounted for very little variance inreported marijuana use.Of the 7,538 block groups in the sample, 371 (4.9%) contained at least one of the 505marijuana dispensaries. Table 3 shows the descriptive statistics for the study block groups.Mean demand per block group was 5,628 person-days (SD 5,492), with mean per capita useof 3.2 days (SD=1.3).Table 4 shows the four multilevel Bayesian conditional autoregressive logit models,including the median estimated effect from the sampled posterior distribution for eachvariable and a 95% credible interval. The 95% credible interval is the 2.5th and 97.5thpercentile of the estimated effect for each variable, and can be interpreted in a similarmanner to a 95% confidence interval from a regular logit model (Mair, Gruenewald,Ponicki, & Remer, 2013). Model 1 (the basic economic geographic model) shows that thepositive association between marijuana demand and increased odds of having a dispensary iswell supported. Model 2 demonstrates that block groups with higher populations were atincreased odds of having a dispensary, as were those with higher estimated per capitamarijuana use.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript Model 3 separated per capita marijuana use into its component predictors from the 2009Census estimates. Block groups with greater proportions of males were at increased odds ofhaving a dispensary, whereas those with higher median household income were at decreasedodds. Specifically, a $10,000 increase in income was associated with 14.5% decreased oddsof having a dispensary in a block group.The relationship between BG level market potential and dispensaries observed in Model 1remained in Model 4 after adjusting for potential confounders. By linear extrapolation of thelog odds, a 10% increase in market potential within a BG was associated with 2.4%increased odds of it having a dispensary. There was no lagged effect of market potential,however a 10% increase in estimated person-days marijuana use across the city wasassociated with 6.7% increased odds of having a dispensary within any block group withinthat city. There was a positive, well supported association between the density of alcoholoutlets and the location of dispensaries. There was no effect for bars/pubs, but where therewas a greater proportion of off-premise outlets there were fewer dispensaries. This findingsuggests that dispensaries are less likely to be located near off-premise alcohol outletscompared to restaurants. Model 4 showed a similar effect for socio-economic status toModel 3. Dispensaries tended to be located in BGs with higher proportions of people livingunder 150% of the poverty line.Posterior spatial random effects ( ) from Model 4 were used to calculate a Moran's I of0.828, indicating a very strong tendency for BGs with dispensaries to agglomerate, andblock groups with no dispensaries to be located adjacent to other block groups with nodispensaries (see Figure 1). The CAR spatial random effects explained over 99% of theoverall error variance in each of the four models. Had we not corrected for these CAReffects, the likelihood of a type I error would have been high.DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrated that medical marijuana dispensaries are found in areas with highmarket potential and low income; thus the two a priori  hypotheses were supported. We alsofound that dispensaries are more likely to be co-located in block groups with alcohol outletsand to be located in buffer areas around the study cities (which are mostly unincorporated).In the absence of prior research into medical marijuana markets, we based our analyses onpredictions from economic geography and prior observations from alcohol markets. Theeffects we observed were as expected, however, the interpretation for marijuana shoulddiffer from that for alcohol. The latter has been legally sold in the United States sinceprohibition ended in 1933 and markets are typically mature and saturated (Gruenewald,2008). By comparison, California's medical marijuana industry is in its infancy. In thatcontext, the theoretical models make clear predictions regarding the future of this emergingindustry. Dispensaries will continue to open to meet demand until the market is saturated, atwhich point they will diversify to appeal to specific market segments (Gruenewald, 2008).The development of new dispensaries will be greater in low income areas and incommunities that lack the social and economic resources to resist their establishment. It ispossible that in the sparse medical marijuana market, the few establishments that exist are

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript located where they attract the least resistance and can service demand from both theirimmediate neighbors (within block groups) and cross-town customers (within cities).Therefore, jurisdictions that do not prohibit marijuana dispensaries will attract them inrelative abundance, due to the opportunity to service demand from both the local andneighboring communities.Our findings and the predictions that follow emphasize the need to determine the true effectof dispensaries on marijuana use and problems in local communities. At present, the linkbetween dispensaries and crime is unclear (Freisthler et al., 2012; Kepple & Freisthler,2012), and there is an association of unknown directionality between dispensaries andincreased marijuana use in California (Freisthler & Gruenewald, 2013). Prior studies ofalcohol outlets may provide some indication as to the neighborhood effects of marijuanadispensaries. However, alcohol and marijuana have substantially different psychoactiveproperties, risks, and business models. The extent to which they have similar detrimentaleffects on local populations is uncertain, as is the effect of new medical marijuanadispensaries on the illegal marijuana market. This is an important area for future study.Availability theory suggests that marijuana dispensaries will cause increased use amonglocal populations beyond the illegal sales they may replace (Stockwell & Gruenewald,2004). If this is the case, or if dispensaries cause increased problems for the communities inwhich they are located, our findings point to a form of environmental injustice in which thesocially disadvantaged are disproportionately exposed to problems (Romley et al., 2007).Limited evidence also suggests that patients may travel between cities to access dispensaries(Freisthler, 2013). Future research may consider effects outside the immediate study city.This study is the first to consider the location of medical marijuana dispensaries incommunities. The primary limitation is the cross-sectional study design, which prohibitsobservation of temporal trends. Small differences in the proportions of African-Americans,whites and Hispanics in the telephone survey compared to the city populations are unlikelyto have materially affected the key findings as the market potential estimate was drivenprimarily by population size (r = 0.86), rather than proportion black (r = 0.01), white (r =0.09) or Hispanic (r = 0.04). The spatial sample permits generalization to other Californiacities of comparable size, but similar studies in other communities would be prudent.Replication of the current analysis with different spatial unit configurations and smallerspatial scales could assess the extent to which our results are affected by the modifiable areaunit problem (Openshaw, 1984) and aggregation bias (Hodgson, Shmulevitz, & Körkel,1997). Our exclusion of the most populous California cities meant we omitted the areas withthe greatest numbers of dispensaries (e.g. the City of Los Angeles). The associations weobserved between dispensaries and higher alcohol outlet density and lower populationdensity may be artifacts of zoning restrictions, which we were not able to adjust for in ouranalyses.Despite these limitations, our findings have implications for policy. Marijuana dispensariesare spatially related to market potential. Jurisdictions that wish to avoid having newdispensaries (and therefore minimize any possible adverse effects associated with theiroperations) should actively prevent their establishment. If dispensaries are found to causeproblems for local populations, the state, county and city regulators should ensure that

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript communities with fewer resources (e.g. those with low incomes, unincorporated areas) arenot burdened with disproportionately large numbers that service demand from both local andneighboring areas. Nevertheless, the uncertain regulatory environment and competition witha parallel black market means the industry will likely be in a constant state of change, andthe consequences of such intervention should be carefully considered. One clear example(and a limitation of the current study) is the recent emergence of home delivery services: aninnovative means of circumventing city ordinances that prohibit marijuana dispensariesfrom operating from shop-front stores. Future longitudinal research would permitinvestigation of such social, political and economic dynamics as medical marijuana marketsmature, and should clarify whether dispensaries indeed cause problems for the communitiesin which they are located.AcknowledgmentsThis research was supported by National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Grant R01-DA-032715 and NationalInstitute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Center Grant P60-AA006282REFERENCESAmerican Association for Public Opinion Research.

Introduction  Gardner	et	al,	2019	
 2	Mood disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety, PTSD) and alcohol and other drug use disorders place a large burden on the individual, families and healthcare systems, and are a significant economic cost in Australia and elsewhere (GBD 2015 Neurological Disorders Collaborator Group, 2017). New and more effective therapies are needed, particularly for those who do not respond to current treatments (Al-Harbi, 2012). Researchers and clinicians have begun exploring the therapeutic potential of psychedelic compounds to treat addiction and mood disorders (Robin L. Carhart-Harris & Goodwin, 2017; Franz X. Vollenweider & Kometer, 2010). These include compounds such as psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and ayahuasca, which induce altered states of consciousness by acting on the brain’s 5-HT2A receptors (i.e. those compounds conventionally defined as ‘psychedelic’), and also 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) that has ‘mind altering’ effects via a different neurochemical pathway.  Initial research interest in the therapeutic use of these compounds began in 1950s but was soon curtailed for political, social, and subsequent legal reasons (Stevens, 1987). The current resurgence of research on the efficacy of these compounds is in its infancy, but preliminary findings are encouraging: some therapeutic benefit has been demonstrated for indications such as major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety associated with life threatening illness, alcohol dependence, and long-term tobacco smoking, and risks of toxicity and dependency appear to be low (Elsey, 2017; Ivan Ezquerra-Romano, Lawn, Krupitsky, & Morgan, 2018). Experts are calling for further studies – particularly controlled trials – to confirm these preliminary but promising findings (de Veen, Schellekens, Verheij, & Homberg, 2017). In order to fast track such studies, the US Food & Drug Administration recently granted ‘breakthrough therapy’ status to psilocybin for the treatment of depression (Rahhal, 2018), and MDMA for the treatment of PTSD (MAPS, 2017a).  Much of this ‘second wave’ of research has taken place in leading academic centers in the US and Europe, including Imperial College London and Johns Hopkins University (Robin L. Carhart-Harris & Goodwin, 2017). There has, however, been a notable absence of research into psychedelic-assisted therapies in Australia. Australian-based advocates argue that research has been hindered by  Gardner	et	al,	2019	
 3	the stigma associated with psychedelics since the 1960s. As some commentators lamented, “Australia risks being left behind… [leaving] Australian psychiatrists and psychologists without opportunities to trial treatments that may benefit many Australians” (Strauss, Bright, & Williams, 2016, p. 1037).   Given the urgent need for new interventions that are more effective in managing mood disorders and substance misuse, it is concerning that research into psychedelic-assisted therapies may be prevented by conservative or ill-informed attitudes. In this piece, we provide a brief account of the historical stigma associated with psychedelics, and an overview of the contemporary context of research into psychedelic-assisted therapies, including the purported barriers to research in Australia. In light of the complex social and political history of psychedelics, we identify a number of pressing questions that need to be addressed so that research can proceed. These questions specifically relate to the current social and legal context of psychedelic research in Australia. Research is needed to address such questions so that the nature and extent of purported barriers to research can be properly elucidated, and strategies developed – with practitioners, patients, families and other stakeholders – to address these barriers. This is important because it will enable Australian researchers to contribute robust evidence about the possible efficacy and safety of psychedelic therapies, and to facilitate local expertise needed to implement psychedelic-assisted therapies, should they prove efficacious.    A brief history: early therapeutic use and the political backlash Plant-derived psychedelics have been used in religious practices and traditional healing in some cultures for thousands of years (Hofmann, 2005). It was in the early 1950s, however, that psychologists and psychiatrists first became interested in the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. This interest was prompted by emerging reports of the subjective effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) which was first synthesized in 1943 (Robin L. Carhart-Harris & Goodwin, 2017). In North America, Europe, and the UK, LSD was adopted within ‘psycholytic’ or ‘psychedelic psychotherapies’ for mood disorders and alcoholism throughout the 1950s. It is estimated that over a period of 15 years, tens of thousands of people were treated with these therapies (Caldwell, 1969; Grinspoon & Bakalar, 1997). In  Gardner	et	al,	2019	
 4	Saskatchewan, Canada, for example, psychedelic therapy became a standard treatment for alcoholism (Dyck, 2006). Scientific studies on the therapeutic effects of psychedelics were undertaken until the 1970s (the most notable being the Spring Grove Experiments in Catonsville, Maryland). The results from these studies were promising, but the small sample sizes and poor study design significantly limit the claims that can be made about the clinical utility of psychedelic substances (Nichols, 2016). Many of these early studies, for example, lacked control participants and did not employ randomization, and there was an absence of standardized diagnostic techniques and assessment tools (Robin L. Carhart-Harris & Goodwin, 2017).   Recreational consumption of LSD famously flourished in the 1960s amongst the counter-cultural movement. By the late 1960s, the political backlash against the movement included an explicit condemnation of LSD, which was described as having a corrosive effect on Western values (Franz X. Vollenweider & Kometer, 2010). LSD became the subject of alarmist mass media attention including claims that it caused insanity, chromosomal damage, and that it convinced users they could fly (Nichols, 2016; Siff, 2015).  These messages were highly influential in shaping the opinions of the general public. In 1965 psychedelics were listed as prohibited substances in the US and were removed from legal circulation. In 1970, President Nixon signed the Controlled Substances Act, in which LSD and psilocybin were listed ‘Schedule 1’, the most restrictive category for drugs with high abuse potential and no medical use, despite no evidence that it was addictive (Stevens, 1987). Similar changes followed in the UK and Europe, and as a result, research into psychedelic-assisted therapies was effectively brought to a halt.     The contemporary context Interest in psychedelic research was renewed in the 1990s by scientists in Europe and the US exploring the psychopharmacological effect of psychedelics in healthy individuals (Hermle et al., 1992; Strassman & Qualls, 1994; F. X. Vollenweider et al., 1997). Promising results from a number of subsequent psychopharmacological, psychological and neuroimaging studies, prompted a handful of  Gardner	et	al,	2019	
 5	early phase clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted therapies for mood disorders or addictions in the 2000s (Robin L. Carhart-Harris & Goodwin, 2017).  Between 2001 and 2004, a proof-of-concept study of psilocybin-assisted therapy in nine patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder found no significant adverse events, and a significant decrease in OCD symptoms in the small sample at the final endpoint 24 hours after the therapy session  (Moreno, Wiegand, Taitano, & Delgado, 2006). Pilot studies of psychedelic-assisted therapies for anxiety associated with life-threatening illness have also produced promising results. Two double-blind, randomized controlled trials, both involving 12 patients (one trial using psilocybin and the other using LSD), found no major adverse effects and a marked reduction in anxiety that was sustained throughout the 12-month follow-up period (Gasser et al., 2014; Grob et al., 2011). Similarly, a double-blind controlled trial of psilocybin in 29 patients with advanced-stage cancer found enduring anxiety-reducing and anti-depressive effects in 60-80% of participants at six-month follow-up (Ross et al., 2016). Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapies for treatment-resistant depression have also shown promise. In an open-label study at Imperial College London, 20 participants were given two doses of psilocybin seven days apart. The 19 patients who completed follow-up assessments experienced a reduction in depression at one week, with nine patients showing a significant response at week five. Significant reductions in depressive measures were observed at the final six-month follow-up. (R. L. Carhart-Harris et al., 2018). Open-label trials of psilocybin treatments for alcohol and tobacco addiction have also shown positive results. A study involving ten patients with alcohol dependence demonstrated a significant increase in abstinence that was largely retained at the 36-week follow-up (Bogenschutz et al., 2015).  While in a study of 15 nicotine-dependent smokers, 12 participants demonstrated abstinence at the six-month follow-up (M. W. Johnson, Garcia-Romeu, Cosimano, & Griffiths, 2014).   While all these trials have demonstrated some therapeutic benefits and no major adverse events, they involved small sample sizes that approximate what would conventionally be described as ‘safety and tolerability’ studies (Robin L. Carhart-Harris & Goodwin, 2017).  In 2018, just over 20 clinical trials involving psilocybin or LSD for therapeutic use are listed in the US Government and  Gardner	et	al,	2019	
 6	European Union clinical trials registries. These are mostly phase two trials for the health conditions listed above, as well as for cocaine-related disorders, cluster headaches, and migraine headaches.        There are a number of likely reasons for the re-emergence of research on psychedelic-assisted therapies. The acute awareness among research and clinical communities that more effective treatments are desperately needed is no doubt one of these (Al-Harbi, 2012). The political climate around the use of these compounds has also changed. While the countercultural movement still features heavily in the public imagination, its potency as a genuinely radical political force has long since dissipated. The so-called ‘war on drugs’ is now considered by many to be a failure (Shultz & Aspe, 2017), and there have been substantial moves towards more liberal drug policies in some countries (e.g. US, Canada, Uruguay). There has been, for example, a growing number of studies examining the clinical benefit of cannabis for a wide range of medical conditions, albeit with mixed results. Social and political concern with PTSD among returned service people and first responders (for which MDMA has shown some promise), is likely to have been another factor. Consequently, in the present climate authorities may now be more inclined to issue researchers with the permits that are required for the manufacturing, sale, storage or use of psilocybin, LSD and other prohibited drugs such as MDMA (Simon, 2018).   The socio-political context is also populated with advocacy groups promoting medical research on the therapeutic benefits of psychedelics and MDMA. This includes the Californian-based (but internationally active) Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), which describes itself as a “research and education organization”, and which is sponsoring clinical trials on the LSD-assisted psychotherapy for anxiety associated with life-threatening illness, MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder, and ibogaine therapy for drug addiction (MAPS, 2017b). Similarly, the Heffter Research Institute, which has close ties with Johns Hopkins University and other academic research centres, is actively involved in designing and funding research into psychedelics.  It is currently seeking to fund clinical studies of psilocybin for the treatment of anorexia nervosa, opioid dependence, depression, and PTSD (""Hefter Research Institute,"" 2018). These and  Gardner	et	al,	2019	
 7	other advocacy organizations have been pivotal in securing the philanthropic support needed to conduct psychedelic research. This has been necessary, commentators have argued, because pharmaceutical companies have been reluctant to invest given that the proposed treatment model (which involves only two or three dosings) does not align with their dominant business model of prolonged treatment (Strauss et al., 2016).    The absence of such studies in Australia has been lamented by some researchers (Strauss et al., 2016) and recent media coverage (Gelfer, 2014; Siddique, 2017; Ten News, 2016).  Researchers from the Australian-based Psychedelic Research in Science & Medicine (PRISM) – a clinical research organization – have been particularly vocal in identifying what they believe to be several barriers to research, based on their own experiences of attempting to initiate research (Bright & Williams, 2018; Bright, Williams, & Caldicott, 2017; Strauss et al., 2016).  They argue, for example, that there is an “entrenched conservativism and risk-aversion in the Australian research community” (Bright & Williams, 2018, p. 472). Research institutions – particularly universities – are reluctant to become involved in potentially controversial research that could tarnish reputations: a PRISM-supported clinical trial for of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of PTSD among war veterans was vetoed by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor at a Victorian university (Bright et al., 2017). The Australian research community is also highly dependent on competitive government funding which is unlikely to support unconventional, ‘risky’ research (Bright & Williams, 2018, p. 472), and there are very few other funding options available for psychedelic research in Australia (Inserra, 2019). PRISM researchers suggest that research ethics committees have been inclined to take a highly conservative approach, despite the demonstrated safety profile of the psychedelic compounds in question (Strauss et al., 2016). It has also been suggested that there is a general ignorance about psychedelics within the wider medical establishment in Australia, particularly among frontline mental health and medical practitioners (Puspanathan, 2017). PRSIM researchers have argued that some practitioners and members of the Australian research community have “vested interests in maintaining the status quo” and are unwilling to recognise the limitations of current “gold standard” treatments (e.g. Cognitive  Gardner	et	al,	2019	
 8	Behavioural Therapy) or to question the dominant paradigm that illicit drugs such as LSD are hazardous and require prohibition (Bright & Williams, 2018, p. 472). There may also be concern among some researchers and clinicians that governments would block controversial trials. Indeed there is precedent for this happening in Australia: in 1997, the Howard government prevented a trial of prescribed heroin to a small number of individuals who had failed all other medical interventions (Mendes, 2001). Consequently, much of the Australian clinical research experience moved over to the UK where a trial of prescribed heroin was conducted providing the first positive evidence in a UK RCT of injectable heroin (Strang et al., 2010).  Moving forward responsibly There is a great need for new treatments for mood disorders and alcohol and other drug problems, and because of the promising findings emerging from early phase clinical studies overseas, Australian-based research into psychedelics should not be prevented on the basis of stigma, history and ill-informed attitudes. Aside from contributing much-needed data on efficacy and safety of psychedelic therapies, Australian-based research will provide psychiatrists and psychologists with an opportunity to trial treatments. This is necessary for building the institutional expertise needed to successfully implement psychedelic-assisted therapies more widely should studies demonstrate their safety and efficacy. It is also important that practitioners have the opportunity to identify the appropriate psychotherapeutic settings for diverse Australian patients.     Commentators have suggested that a greater understanding of the effectiveness of psychedelic compounds at the molecular level will persuade funding bodies and academic institutions to support research into psychedelic-assisted therapies (e.g. Inserra, 2019). However, Science and Technology Studies (STS) research into medical and healthcare innovations has noted that a favorable safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness profile of a therapeutic intervention is not, on its own, sufficient to guarantee its ongoing development or eventual implementation within clinical practice. The priorities of institutions, the interests and viewpoints of researchers and professional groups, and the wider  Gardner	et	al,	2019	
 9	political climate can represent formidable barriers to innovation, even for highly promising interventions (John Gardner, Higham, Faulkner, & Webster, 2017; J. Gardner, Webster, & Barry, 2018). Hence, we suggest that it is necessary to comprehensively investigate whether the socio-cultural barriers identified by advocates do indeed exist in Australia, and if they do, to identify ways in which such barriers can be responsibly managed.  There are pressing questions relating to the use of psychedelics that need to be actively addressed, beyond those relating to the safety and efficacy of psychedelic compounds. First and foremost, how receptive are Australian publics - and especially afflicted individuals and their families – to the possibility of psychedelic-assisted therapies? How, for example, might the potential of psychedelics to induce what are often described as ‘mystical experiences’ accord with the religious and cultural perspectives of Australian publics? Equally important are the views and perspectives of frontline health professionals. What are their concerns relating to their use, and more generally, what capacity is there in Australia for implementing psychedelic assisted therapies? The institutional requirements for implementation may represent a significant hurdle: current clinical studies involve a therapy session that lasts up to eight hours, and involve two therapists or ‘monitors’ who have “significant human relation skills” and who are ideally “familiar with descriptions of altered states of consciousness” (M. Johnson, Richards, & Griffiths, 2008).  Another important question here relates to the primacy of the session’s ‘set and setting’ for configuring a therapeutic response. The current standard in contemporary studies involves a ‘living-room’ type arrangement and a carefully prepared music playlist that includes classical music (M. Johnson et al., 2008; Kaelen et al., 2018).  Such western-centric ‘set and setting’ configurations may not be appropriate for all health care recipients in a population as diverse as Australia’s. How, then, might Australian healthcare professionals go about creating more tailored, culturally-relevant ‘set and setting’ configurations?  The legal classification of psilocybin, LSD and other hallucinogens as prohibited drugs also raises important questions. Finding a suitable supplier for a clinical-grade psychedelics for research purposes is already a known problem (Wong, 2013), but how might regulators respond to a permit  Gardner	et	al,	2019	
 10	request to undertake research involving psilocybin? What considerations are likely to shape their decision-making? Additionally, can we learn anything from recent legislative developments – such as the passing of Victoria’s Access to Medicinal Cannabis Act (2016) – for facilitating medicinal access to psychedelic compounds, should they be proven safe and effective?   The potential negative impact of hype also needs to be monitored.  The emergence of over-optimistic portrayals of psychedelics in the public realm remains a very real possibility, especially given the highly active role of advocacy groups and recent positive media coverage. Already private operators are seeking to capitalize on the positive messages surrounding psychedelic compounds: ‘detox’ clinics are advertising expensive and unproven Ibogaine therapies at luxury health resorts in Mexico, Thailand, and other countries where the substance has not been prohibited (Carter & Hall, 2011). How, then, might the findings of legitimate research be clearly communicated to the public in an era when health-related information is produced and circulated by numerous sources?   The history of psychedelic research provides a stark reminder of how scientific endeavor can be stunted by socio-political factors. Psychedelics are politically and culturally loaded, and the result of this is that we are bereft of a much-needed body of evidence on their therapeutic capacity. Addressing the questions such as those discussed here can help ‘prepare the ground’ for responsible research into psychedelic-assisted therapies, and indeed other therapies using prohibited drugs. We believe that to do so requires a multidisciplinary approach that draws extensively on the social sciences, particularly sociology, STS, socio-legal studies and neuroethics. These disciplines have a rich heritage of investigating the socio-political dimensions of science, as well as expertise in actively engaging with health service providers, patient and consumer groups, and publics.

ABSTRACT
Background : Maternal cannabis use in pregnancy is linked with long-term adverse behavioral
outcomes in offspring. Epigenetic processes established in utero that affect dopaminergic (reward)
signaling may mediate risks. Associations between cannabis use and offspring DNA methylation
have not been investigated; however, maternal tobacco smoking in pregnancy is associated with
distinct patterns of DNA methylation at birth and beyond. Objectives : To determine whether
maternal cannabis use is associated with methylation of the dopamine receptor gene DRD4
promoter in infants. Methods : Mothers in the Triple B study provided detailed information on
drug use in each trimester of pregnancy. Buccal swabs were collected from neonates at 8 weeks ( n
= 804, 51.7% male, and 48.3% female). DRD4 promoter DNA methylation was measured using
SEQUENOM MassARRAY. Results : Fifty-seven of the women in the study reported drug use during
pregnancy, of whom 44 used cannabis. Of 19 cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides (CpG)
units tested in DRD4, gestational cannabis use was associated with offspring methylation at 1 CpG
unit in multivariate models ( β+ 1.48, CI: 0.02 to 2.93, and p= 0.047). At another site there was
weak evidence that both cannabis and other drug use were independently associated with
increased methylation, while the association with tobacco was in the reverse direction (cannabis
useβ+ 0.67, CI: −0.12 to 1.46, and p= 0.09; other drug use β+ 1.11, CI: 0.17 to 2.05, and p= 0.02;
tobacco use β−0.41, CI: −0.85 to 0.03, and p= 0.07). None of the associations would remain
significant after correction for multiple testing. Conclusion : There is no strong evidence that
maternal cannabis use in pregnancy is associated with offspring DRD4 methylation.ARTICLE HISTORY

Introduction
Drug or “substance ”use during pregnancy is relatively
common, reported by up to 5% of women in the gen-
eral population, with cannabis the most frequently used
(1). Given the changing prevalence of use related to
legislative changes in some countries (i.e., increasing
use with decriminalization), studies concerning mater-
nal cannabis use are an important consideration for
public health ( 2,3).
Although research into the effects of prenatal expo-
sure to maternal cannabis use on offspring is still in its
infancy, adverse effects have been reported. A recent
meta-analysis involving 24 studies found that cannabis-exposed infants had a higher risk of anemia, decreased
birth weight, and a greater chance of being placed in
intensive care ( 4). Subsequent studies have reported
similar findings ( 5) as well as longer-term detrimental
effects. Mothers who used cannabis daily in the first
trimester had offspring with deficits in verbal reasoning
and short-term memory in childhood ( 6) and any in
utero exposure has been associated with attention pro-
blems and increased aggression in 18-month-old girls
(7). Heavy cannabis use (one or more joints a day)
during the first trimester of pregnancy has also been
associated with lower reading, spelling, maths, and
comprehension skills in 10-year-old primary school

 students ( 8), which may be due in part to an increased
risk of mood disorders such as anxiety and depression.
The detrimental effects of cannabis could result from
the transmission of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),
the psychoactive constituent within cannabis, to the
fetus ( 9). THC can readily cross the placenta, it has
been shown to increase the diameter of umbilical veins
and arteries, and THC stimulation of endocannabinoid
signaling may induce apoptosis of developing placental
cytotrophoblasts ( 10). Thus biologically available THC
can have a negative impact on the fetus in utero . Given
its key role in prenatal development and association
with several postnatal phenotypes in humans, epige-
netic mechanisms may help mediate these short-term
and long-term detrimental effects ( 11). Broadly, epige-
netics refers to environmentally sensitive alterations in
gene expression that do not change the underlying
DNA sequence ( 12). DNA methylation, particularly
methylation of cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleo-
tides (CpG), is the most commonly studied epigenetic
mechanism.
Most epigenetic studies of cannabis have focused on
the effects of cannabis use in adults, primarily investi-
gating the THC cannabinoid receptor type 1 ( CNR1 )
which encodes the receptor CB 1R. Elevated methylation
of the CNR1 promoter and downregulation of CB 1R
mRNA, as measured in peripheral blood, is associated
with cannabis use in schizophrenia patients ( 13).
Methylation levels were also related to the severity
and frequency of cannabis cravings. CB 1R is known to
be co-expressed with dopamine receptors ( 14) and
cannabis, like all recreational drugs, causes an increase
in dopamine levels in the terminal regions of the meso-
limbic dopamine system. Dopamine signaling is linked
to memory, cognition, and is one of the major reward
pathways in the brain implicated in drug addiction
(15). Little is known about the effects of maternal
cannabis use on methylation of genes involved in dopa-
mine signaling in offspring.
The primary aim of this study was to determine the
association between maternal gestational cannabis use
and offspring DNA methylation. Of the set of genes
controlling neuro-signaling within dopaminergic path-
ways, this study focused on offspring DRD4 methyla-
tion patterns given that this gene has not only been
associated with substance use ( 16) and addiction
(17,18), but importantly has also been linked to infant
health outcomes, including birth weight, behavior, and
neurodevelopment ( 19,20). Differential methylation of
this gene could thus help mediate the association
between maternal substance use and poor infant health
outcomes, although no studies to date have yet mea-
sured DRD4 methylation in this regard.The secondary aim was to investigate how maternal
tobacco smoking could influence the association
between cannabis and infant methylation. Most studies
to date do not differentiate cannabis from tobacco use,
despite the fact that cannabis is often smoked together
with tobacco, and tobacco has similar effects on infant
health. This is problematic because maternal smoking
during pregnancy has been consistently shown to influ-
ence infant DNA methylation in peripheral tissue and
to mediate the association between prenatal exposure
(21,22) and infant birth weight ( 23). Furthermore, a
very recent study found that cannabis alone had no
independent effect on perinatal outcomes, but augmen-
ted the risk associated with tobacco smoking ( 24).
Studies examining effects associated with tobacco and
cannabis in isolation and in combination are needed to
elucidate unique effects.
Methods
Triple B pregnancy cohort
This longitudinal pregnancy cohort of 1,634 families is
focused on perinatal maternal lifestyle factors and
infant health outcomes. Families were recruited
through general public and specialist drug and alcohol
antenatal services at major hospitals in New South
Wales and Western Australia ( 25). Mother –infant
dyads with major medical complications were excluded.
Written informed consent was provided by all partici-
pants, and all relevant human research ethics commit-
tees approved the study. In-depth health, lifestyle, and
sociodemographic data were collected across pregnancy
and postpartum. This included detailed questionnaires
about drug use in each trimester of pregnancy and the
first 8 weeks postpartum.
Methylation analysis
The DRD4 methylation assay covered a 396 base pair
region of the gene promoter spanning chr11:635,510 –
636,905 (UCSC hg38), previously shown to be differ-
entially methylated in association with attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) ( 26). Infant buccal
swabs were collected at 8 weeks of age. Extracted
DNA underwent bisulfite conversion (EZ-96 DNA
Methylation-LightningTMMagPrep kit (Irvine, CA)),
followed by PCR amplification in triplicate with pri-
mers 5 ʹ-GGACCCCCTGCCCAGGGTCAGAGG-3 ʹand
5ʹ-TGCCAGATACCAGGTGGACTAGGGTG-3 ʹ, and
Sequenom MassARRAY analysis ( 27). Average DRD4
methylation was calculated after excluding any tripli-
cate samples deviating by ≥10% from the median.672 P. D. FRANSQUET ET AL.

 Outlying data (>10% outside 1.5xIQR) were excluded,
as were CpG units ( n= 4) and participants with <85%
data retained after quality control ( n= 92). Health,
lifestyle, and sociodemographic data did not differ sig-
nificantly between excluded participants and those
included in this analysis.
Statistical analysis
To investigate the association between prenatal mater-
nalsubstance use (yes/no) with infant DRD4 promoter
methylation, t-tests were used for univariate analysis,
followed by multivariate linear regression models
adjusted for potential confounding factors, and
Sequenom batch effects.
Results
Table 1 shows the maternal and infant characteristics of
the population according to cannabis use during preg-
nancy. Cannabis use was the most commonly used
drug ( n= 44, 77.2% of drug users) and was most
common among mothers in trimester 1 ( Table 2 ), likely
prior to knowledge of pregnancy. Of those who
reported cannabis use, eight used cannabis daily
throughout trimester 1, with the dose ranging between
(the equivalent of) 0.5 and 7 joints. A total of 29
women used other types of drugs, with the type and
quantity varying quite considerably. Of these women,
16 also used cannabis.
We first investigated the association between any
type of substance use during pregnancy and infant
DRD4 promoter methylation. Of 19 CpG units tested,
the only evidence of an association was a very small
increase in methylation at CpG.32 ( Δ+ 0.78, 95% CI:
0.17 –1.38%, and p= 0.012) ( Figure 1 , Table S1).
Cannabis use was similarly associated with differential
methylation at the same site ( Δ+ 0.79, 95% CI: 0.11 –
1.46%, and p= 0.023) ( Figure 2 , Table S2). These
associations remained even after adjustment for covari-
ates, including drug use at 8 weeks postpartum, given
the potential for effects resulting from exposure duringbreastfeeding or second-hand exposure. Smoking
tobacco during pregnancy was itself associated with
DRD4 methylation at this same site, but in the reverse
direction (cannabis: β+ 0.77, 95% CI: 0.06 to 1.48, and
p= 0.032; tobacco: β−0.41, 95% CI: −0.85 to 0.03, and
p= 0.072). However, when adjusting for other sub-
stance use as a covariate, which was also associated
with increased CpG.32 methylation, the association
with cannabis becomes nonsignificant (cannabis: β+
0.67, 95% CI: −0.12 to 1.46, and p= 0.098; other
substance use: β+ 1.11, 95% CI: 0.17 to 2.05, and p=
0.020). Cannabis use was also associated with increased
methylation at CpG.21.22.23 when we adjusted for
tobacco use in the multivariate model ( β+ 1.48, 95%
CI: 0.02 to 2.93, and p= 0.047, unadjusted Δ+ 1.03,
95% CI: −0.29% to 2.36%, and p= 0.13), and regardless
of other drug use. Out of interest, adding alcohol use
during pregnancy to these models did not alter the
associations seen.

 Given that cannabis is freq uently taken together
with tobacco, we further compared DRD4 promoter
methylation levels across four groups: no drug or
tobacco use ( n= 658), tobacco alone ( n= 96), can-
nabis alone ( n= 9), and both cannabis and tobacco
(n= 35). Only cannabis use appeared to increase
m e t h y l a t i o nc o m p a r e dt on os u b s t a n c eu s e
(Table 3 ). In addition, exclusive cannabis use was
associated with 2.08% higher methylation at CpG.32
compared to tobacco use alone (95% CI: 0.19 –3.96%
and p= 0.024). Exclusive cannabis use compared to
combined cannabis and tobacco showed no signifi-
cant difference in DNA methylation ( p= 0.48).
Discussion
Here we report a nominally significant association
between cannabis use during pregnancy and
increased DRD4 promoter methylation at one CpG
site (CpG11:636796, hg38) in infants, which
remained after adjustmen t for concurrent tobacco
use. We also found some, although nonsignificant,
evidence that both other drug use and cannabis use
appeared to increase methylation at another site,
while tobacco smoking had a reverse effect
(decreased methylation). This is despite reports that
cannabis and tobacco have similar ( 28) and even
cumulative detrimental ef fects on infant health ( 24).
However, the overall effect sizes observed are very
small and the strength of association would not
remain if corrected for multiple testing (using a
Bonferroni corrected sign ificance level of 0.0026
given the 19 CpG units examined).
Dopamine signaling is involved in many cognitive
processes, including memory and reward ( 15).
Cannabis dependence is linked to a reduction in
striatal dopamine releas e which is also correlated
with poor working memory and learning perfor-
mance ( 29). Prenatal cannabis exposure has been
associated with decreased dopamine receptor D2
expression in human fetal brain specimens ( 30).
Dopamine receptor deficiency has been linked to
increased choice and immediacy to use drugs, and
is observed in people with substance use disorders(31).DRD4 ,aD 2 - l i k ed o p a m i n er e c e p t o r ,w a sc h o -
sen as a strong candidate gene in this study due to its
key role in dopamine signaling, and its links to drug
use in genetic association studies. A DRD4 variable
number tandem repeat has been associated with
increased problematic cannabis use ( 32), and a heigh-
tened risk of externalizing behavior problems that
contribute to substance use disorders and addiction
(33).DRD4 genetic variants can also moderate the
effect of prenatal stress on children ’s antisocial beha-
vior ( 34). Furthermore, increased DRD4 methylation
in saliva has been associated with increased severity
of ADHD symptoms in children ( 35).
Our study is strengthened by the in-depth data
concerning substance use and tobacco smoking
across pregnancy and the large sample size. The
percentage of women using drugs during pregnancy
(7.03%) was higher than that reported in the general
Australian population (2.2%) ( 36). Our study had
over 80% power ( α= 0.05, two-sided) to detect a
minimum effect size of 0.385 standard deviation (SD)
difference in the mean methylation between groups.
For CpG.32 for example, with a group SD of 2.2, our
study could detect a methylation difference of 0.86%

of our study. Dopamine sig naling is prominent in the
brain, but due to the limitations in accessing such
tissue, we chose to investigate buccal cell DNA
methylation, given that ( 1) buccal epithelial cells
have the same developmental origins to neuronal
cells (i.e., derive from ectoderm) and ( 2)p r e v i o u s

limited due to underreporti ng of maternal substance
use, which could help explain the predominantly
negative findings (if a proportion of women classified
as nonusers had in fact used drugs during preg-
nancy). However, to address this limitation in the
Triple B study, a random selection of 85 participants
provided urine samples for analysis in the third tri-
mester of pregnancy. There was 97% agreement
between self-report substance use and urine analysis,
indicating the overall high accuracy of the self-report
data. Other limitations are that we could not properlyTable 3. Infant DRD4 CpG.32 methylation when comparing

cannabis, as only nine cannabis users in the study did
not smoke tobacco.
Conclusion and future research
We found no convincing evidence of an association
between prenatal substance use overall or cannabis use
and differential infant DRD4 methylation. However,
given the reported effects of maternal drug use on infant
health outcomes, as well as consistent evidence that smok-
ing tobacco during pregnancy influences infant peripheral
DNA methylation, it is possible that genes other than
DRD4 may be involved, such as CNR1 . Further studies
could investigate other components of dopaminergic sig-
naling, or use a more unbiased discovery approach such
as an epigenome-wide association study. Both approaches
would benefit from a substantially larger sample of mater-
nal drug users. Such approaches are essential to provide a
better understanding of the biological mechanisms
underlying the association between prenatal drug expo-
sure and infant health outcomes.

Introduction
Cannabis is frequently used and is associated with adverse out-comes on mental health (Degenhardt and Hall, 2012; Hall and Degenhardt, 2009). The frequency of cannabis use typically peaks in young adulthood (Copeland et al., 2013), a period of extensive neuroanatomical remodelling (Ostby et al., 2009; Raznahan et al., 2014), particularly in areas high in cannabinoid receptors via which cannabinoid compounds exert their effects (Jacobus and Tapert, 2014). The primary psychoactive cannabinoid compound tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is found in increasing levels in com-monly available cannabis (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2014) and may be neurotoxic (Chan et al., 1998; Rocchetti et al., 2013). Young adults who use cannabis on a regular basis might be particularly sensitive to the potential neurotoxic effects of cannabinoid exposure (Jacobus and Tapert, 2014).The hippocampus is a brain region with one of the highest den-sities of cannabinoid receptors (Glass et al., 1997), and may thus be particularly vulnerable to the effects of cannabinoid exposure (Lorenzetti et al., 2013; Ranganathan and D’Souza, 2006). Hippocampal volumetric reductions have been reported in  cannabis users (for a meta-analysis, see Rocchetti et al., 2013), although only for the left and right hemisphere combined. In our previous study in the same sample (Koenders et al., 2016) using Longitudinal study of hippocampal volumes  in heavy cannabis users

Abstract
Background: Cannabis exposure, particularly heavy cannabis use, has been associated with neuroanatomical alterations in regions rich with cannabinoid receptors such as the hippocampus in some but not in other (mainly cross-sectional) studies. However, it remains unclear whether continued heavy cannabis use alters hippocampal volume, and whether an earlier age of onset and/or a higher dosage exacerbate these changes.Methods: Twenty heavy cannabis users (mean age 21 years, range 18–24 years) and 23 matched non-cannabis using healthy controls were submitted to a comprehensive psychological assessment and magnetic resonance imaging scan at baseline and at follow-up (average of 39 months post-baseline; standard deviation=2.4). Cannabis users started smoking around 16 years and smoked on average five days per week. A novel aspect of the current study is that hippocampal volume estimates were obtained from manual tracing the hippocampus on T1-weighted anatomical magnetic resonance imaging scans, using a previously validated protocol.Results: Compared to controls, cannabis users did not show hippocampal volume alterations at either baseline or follow-up. Hippocampal volumes increased over time in both cannabis users and controls, following similar trajectories of increase. Cannabis dose and age of onset of cannabis use did not affect hippocampal volumes.Conclusions: Continued heavy cannabis use did not affect hippocampal neuroanatomical changes in early adulthood. This contrasts with prior evidence on alterations in this region in samples of older adult cannabis users. In young adults using cannabis at this level, cannabis use may not be heavy enough to affect hippocampal neuroanatomy.

voxel-based morphometry (VBM), we found that grey matter development of the hippocampal region over a period of 39 months did not differ between cannabis users aged 21–25 years and age-matched controls. Importantly, at baseline there was a significant negative correlation between the amount of use in grams per week and grey matter density in a cluster comprising the left hippocam-pus. However, VBM may suffer from bias due to suboptimal and limited localization accuracy (Mechelli et al., 2005). In addition, global measures of volume lack information on the details of the topography within a given brain structure (Gilman et al., 2014). We decided to study the hippocampal region in more detail using man-ual tracing of the hippocampus in the same sample. The use of a manual tracing technique by an experienced tracer has the benefit of enhanced sensitivity to subtle effects in hippocampal shape and greater precision in detecting inter-individual variability in ana-tomical boundaries when compared to the application of auto-mated protocols such as VBM (Stjepanovic et al., 2013). Manual tracing also allows shape analyses, enabling examination of whether cannabis use affects specific hippocampal sub regions (Gilman et al., 2014; Gogtay et al., 2006).During normal development hippocampal volumes develop in a curvilinear slope, first increasing with age (Goddings et al., 2014; Ostby et al., 2009) and decreasing around the mid 30s (Ostby et al., 2009; Raz et al., 2004). Continued cannabis use during young adulthood may influence development through causing hippocampal volumetric reductions in cannabis users over time.Small hippocampal volumes have been found most consist-ently in samples with high levels of cannabis exposure (for reviews, see Lorenzetti et al., 2013; Rocchetti et al., 2013). Also, an earlier age of onset of cannabis use may have a negative effect on hippocampal structure and function (Solowij and Battisti, 2008). However, in the meta-analysis of Rocchetti et al. (2013), no correlation was found between duration of use and hippocam-pal volumes. Also, cross-sectional structural neuroimaging stud-ies to date did not find associations between hippocampal volume and age of onset in cannabis users (for a review, see Lorenzetti et al., 2013). An earlier age of onset of cannabis use was found to be related to an elevated risk for cannabis dependence (Grant and Pickering, 1998) and development of psychotic disorders (Arseneault et al., 2002). Also, an earlier age of onset of cannabis use was shown to be related to impaired performance on hip-pocampal-mediated cognitive tasks like the spatial working memory task (Harvery et al., 2007) and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (Harvery et al., 2007). Therefore, we propose that an earlier age of onset may hamper the typical developmental increase (Goddings et al., 2014; Ostby et al., 2009) in hippocam-pal volume in cannabis users.To evaluate this hypothesis we conducted a longitudinal study with a precise and reliable assessment of hippocampal volume and (also for the first time) hippocampal shape, using manual tracing of hippocampal neuroanatomy in heavy cannabis using young adults and matched healthy non-using controls. Participants were examined at baseline (BL) and at three-year follow-up (FU). We expected that (a) heavy cannabis users would show reduced hippocampal volumetric gain over time (Goddings et al., 2014; Ostby et al., 2009; Raz et al., 2004); (b) earlier onset of heavy cannabis use and (cumulative) dose would be associated with a larger decrease in normally expected gains in hippocampal volume in cannabis users.Methods
This study was nested within a three-year longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigation of heavy cannabis users (Cousijn et al., 2014). Cannabis users and controls underwent a comprehensive psychological assessment and MRI scan BL in 2009 and at FU in 2012, after an average of 39 months (standard deviation (SD) 2.4 months). The medical ethics committee of the Academic Medical Centre approved the study and all participants signed informed consent before participation.
Participants
At baseline, we recruited 33 heavy cannabis users and 43 con-trols, aged 18–25 years, through advertisements on the Internet and in cannabis outlets (coffee-shops). Both groups were matched for age, gender, education, estimated intelligence (Dutch Adult Reading Test (DART); Schmand et al., 1991), and alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT); Saunders et al., 1993). Cannabis users were included if they used cannabis for at least two years for more than 10 days per month and did not seek treatment for cannabis use problems. All cannabis users included in this study smoked cannabis joints. Controls were cur - rent non-users, who used cannabis on less than 50 occasions dur - ing their lifetime and did not use cannabis during the past year. All participants were instructed to abstain from alcohol and drugs 24 h prior to participation. We performed urine toxicology tests at both assessments to corroborate self-reported substance use (Roese and Jamieson, 1993). Other exclusion criteria were gen-eral MRI-contraindications, major physical disorders, and psy-chiatric disorders (including the presence of any psychotic symptoms), which were assessed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI; Dutch version 5.0.0, Sheehan et al., 1998). Participants were financially compensated for tak-ing part in the study.Of the 33 cannabis users recruited for BL assessment, 24 users completed the FU assessment. Twenty-seven of the 40 con-trols assessed at BL completed the FU assessment. We excluded three cannabis users that quit cannabis use between BL and FU assessment and three controls that started cannabis use over the same period. In addition, we excluded two participants with low quality MRI scans (one cannabis user and one control). The group available for analysis thus consists of 20 heavy cannabis users and 23 controls.
Questionnaires
Participants underwent a comprehensive assessment of history of cannabis use, from which we derived age of onset of regular (weekly) use and lifetime cumulative dosage, measured in ‘amount of grams of cannabis’. The latter was calculated at base-line as (g per week)×52 (weeks per year), multiplied by the amount of years of regular (i.e. weekly) use (adopted from Yücel et al., 2008). We also computed the change of use in the interval between BL and FU (in g), and accounted for periods of lighter and heavier use.Problem severity and frequency of cannabis use were meas-ured using the Cannabis Use Disorder Identification Test (CUDIT; Adamson and Sellman, 2003). We assessed the severity  Koenders et al. 1029
of nicotine dependence using the Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire (FTQ; Fagerstrom and Schneider, 1989). At fol-low-up, the MINI (Dutch version 5.0.0, Sheehan et al., 1998) was conducted by two experienced psychologists (LK and WAMV) to assess the presence of DSM-IV mental disorders.
MRI acquisition and processing
T1-weighted structural MRI scans were acquired from all partici-pants on a 3T MRI scanner (Intera, Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) with a phased array SENSE eight-channel receiver head coil (T1 turbo field echo, TR 9.6 s, TE 4.6 s, 182 slices, slice thickness 1.2 mm, FOV 256×256, in-plane resolution 256×256 mm, flip angle 8°). Images were visually inspected for artifacts, and subsequently skull stripped of non-brain tissue using BET (Smith, 2002) and intensity inhomogeneities were corrected for using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 software (SPM8; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Images were linearly registered to the standard template of the Montréal Neurological Institute (MNI) with six degrees-of-freedom rigid body transformations using FLIRT (Jenkinson and Smith, 2001). Subsequently, voxel dimension drift was corrected by registering follow-up to base-line images with nine degrees of freedom (Whitwell et al., 2004), also using FLIRT (Jenkinson and Smith, 2001).Tracing was performed blind to group membership and time of assessment by the first author (LK) using ANALYZE version 11 (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA). The hippocampus was defined based on a previously validated technique and proceeded from the caudal (i.e. tail) to the rostral end of the hippocampus (i.e. head) on coronally displayed MRI slices (Velakoulis et al., 1999; Velakoulis et al., 2006; Whittle et al., 2008). Hippocampal tracings included the hippocampus proper, the dentate gyrus, the subiculum, and part of the fimbria and alveus. For a detailed trac-ing protocol, see Supplementary Material, Section 1.Reliability of hippocampal tracing was assessed by compar - ing ten randomly selected images with those of an experienced tracer (VL). Absolute agreement inter-rater reliability scores for left and right hemisphere were ICC=0.92 and ICC=0.97, respec-tively, and intra-rater reliability for left and right hemisphere were 0.98 and 0.94, respectively.V olumetric estimates were obtained by summing all voxels within traced brain regions on consecutive coronal slices. Hippocampal volumes were adjusted for intracranial volume (ICV) by an analysis of covariance approach:Adjusted volume=raw volume–b×(ICV–mean ICV)where b is the slope of the regression line of hippocampal volume (left or right) and ICV (BL or FU) respectively (Erickson et al., 2011). Adjusted volumes were used for all analyses described in this article.
Shape analyses
To investigate specific morphometric changes within the hip-pocampus, we performed a hippocampal shape analysis through the University of North Carolina shape analysis toolkit, version 1.12 (Spherical Harmonic Shape Description (SHPARM-PDM); Brechbühler et al., 1995). A detailed description of the methodol-ogy is available in Styner et al. (2004, 2006). In brief, images of segmented hippocampi were first converted to surface meshes, and a spherical parameterization was computed, creating a one-to-one mapping between surface and sphere. The surface was expanded into a series of spherical harmonics, truncated at a degree of k=15. The coefficients of the series expansion were normalized in order to make them invariant to rotation, transla-tion and scale. The SPHARM parameterization was transformed into a triangulated surface (called the SPHARM-PDM), based on a uniform subdivision of the spherical parameterization. Each hippocampus was described by a set of n=1002 landmarks. The SPHARM-PDM was spatially aligned using rigid Procrustes alignment, giving a one-to-one mapping between surface points of each pair of hippocampi. Finally, to test longitudinal shape changing, MeshMath was applied to compute the distance map (with information of both length and direction at each landmark) between the two time points.Statistical analyses
Demographic data were compared between groups and over time using repeated measures analysis of variance tests, independent samples t-tests and paired samples t-tests. To assess whether can-nabis use was related to changes in hippocampal volumes over time, we performed a repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOV A), with hippocampal volumes as dependent variables, time of assessment and hemisphere as repeated measure, group as between subjects factor, and gender and age (measured at baseline centred around the grand mean) as covariates.To examine whether age of onset of regular cannabis use and levels of cannabis exposure mediate changes in hippocampal vol-umes over time, we performed a repeated measures ANCOV A within the cannabis group with hippocampal volume as depend-ent variable and the median split of cumulative dosage at baseline as a covariate: a low cumulative dose (n=9, <351 g) and a high cumulative dose subgroup (n=10, >351 g). To examine the ‘inde-pendent’ impact of cumulative dose (both of pre-baseline period and the time to follow-up, i.e. dosage change) versus age of onset, we used the following statistical model: time of assess-ment and hemisphere were entered as repeated measures, median split cumulative dosage (i.e. high vs low) as between subjects factor, and age, age of onset of regular use, dosage change and gender as covariates. We repeated all analysis without the sub-jects that started using drugs other than cannabis or developed a psychiatric disorder to control for these confounding factors. For an overview of the sample’s psychiatric comorbidities and/or polysubstance use see Supplementary Material, Table 6.We used Shape Analysis MANCOV A from the SPHARM-PDM toolbox for the shape analyses, for left and right hemi-sphere separately. All results were adjusted for age at baseline, gender and intracranial volume. Due to failed preprocessing we had to exclude some tracings. For bilateral hippocampi we excluded five subjects (left: two cannabis users, three healthy controls (HCs); right: three cannabis users, one HC). As depend-ent variables we used the individual distance maps, containing the difference between FU and BL per surface point (1002 land-marks). We used a MANCOV A for the between-group analyses (i.e. group and dosage), and the toolkit’s correlational analysis to calculate Spearman’s correlations with age of onset. Further, a one-sample t-test was applied to check the time effect on hip-pocampal shape changing across whole group. The output was controlled for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) correction procedure (Paniagua et al., 2009; Pantazis  1030 Journal of Psychopharmacology 31(8)
et al., 2004; Styner et al., 2004). Results were visualized for the left and right hemisphere on a mean surface of all tracings, using KWVisu (Oguz et al., 2006).
Results
Sample characteristics
Sample demographics, clinical, neurocognitive and substance use characteristics are provided in Table 1. The gender distribu-tion was similar between groups (14 males, six females) and the control group (13 males, 10 females; χ
2(1)=0.83, p=0.36).Cannabis users and controls did not significantly differ on premorbid IQ (DART) and alcohol dependence (AUDIT), while onset of nicotine use showed a statistical trend. Cannabis users showed higher levels of cannabis and nicotine dependence than controls (CUDIT and FTQ scores, respectively) at BL and FU. CUDIT scores remained stable over time, but FTQ scores increased between BL and FU up in both groups. The amount of daily cigarettes and alcohol use problems was stable over time in both groups. We found an increase over time in weekly dose of cannabis use and also in number of days of use, at a trend-level significance (Table 1). The dosage change of cannabis use between BL and FU ranged between 31–1872 g (M=564 g; SD=511 g). Comorbid DSM-IV diagnoses assessed at FU are reported in Supplementary Material, Table 6.All participants but one remained abstinent for one or two days before the assessment at both BL (less than a day, n=1; 1 day, n=11; 2 days or more, n=8) and FU (less than a day, n=1; 1 day, n=11; 2 days or more, n=8). Control participants used can-nabis on an average of two occasions in their lifetime on the base-line assessment (range 0–30) and on four occasions (range 0–25) on the follow-up assessment. One control subject used cannabis on 30 occasions. This subject was comparable to the control group on all other behavioural clinical substance use measures on visual data inspection. Control analyses were rerun without this subject, which did not change the results. This subject was kept to preserve power.Hippocampal volumes
Our first aim was to identify whether heavy cannabis use had an effect on changes in hippocampal volumes over a three-year period in a sample of young adults. We found a significant main effect of time (F(1,39)=26.22, p<0.001, η
2=0.40; Figure 1) indi- cating that the hippocampus was larger at follow-up relative to baseline. However, we found no significant main effect of group (F(1,39)=0.17, p=0.69) and no significant group by time interaction effect on hippocampal volumes (F (1,39)=0.01, p=0.93; Supplementary material, Table 1) indicating that heavy cannabis use did not alter the course of hippocampal volume development in this three-year period. In addition, we found a significant main effect for gender (F(1,39)=10.33, p=0.003, η
2=0.21), from which we can infer that males had larger hip-pocampal volumes than females in both groups, on both time points and in both hemispheres (see supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Material, Figure 1).There was a significant interaction effect of time by hemi-sphere on hippocampal volumes (F(1,39)=12.04, p=0.001, η
2=0.24; Supplementary Material, Table 1). The difference between left and right hippocampal volumes was more marked at baseline (mean difference=113.43, p=<0.001) than at follow-up (mean difference=76.63, p=<0.001) with larger left volumes in all groups and on both time points (Supplementary Material, Table 5). We did not find a significant main effect of age (F(1,39)=0.001, p=0.98), nor did we find any other (two-way or three-way) interaction effects (Supplementary Material, Table 1). All these effects remained similar when subjects with polysub-stance use and/or a comorbid psychiatric disorder were removed from the analysis (Supplementary Material, Tables 7(a) and (b)).Table 1. Demographic information at each time point. There were no significant interaction effects between time and group, therefore only main effects are reported.

Our second aim was to identify whether cannabis use charac-teristics (i.e. age of onset of regular use, lifetime cumulative dose and dose change) predicted hippocampal volume changes over time in the group of heavy cannabis users. There were no signifi-cant effects of lifetime cumulative dose or dosage change (F(1,9)=1.94, p=0.20, η
2=0.17 and F(1,9)=0.50, p=0.50., η2=0.05 respectively; Supplementary Material, Table 2). However,  we did find a trend for an effect of age of onset of regular use  on hippocampal volumes (F(1,9)=3.72, p=0.086, η
2=0.29; Supplementary Material, Table 2), with a younger age of onset being associated with a larger increase in hippocampal volumes over time (see Supplementary Material, Figure 2). This effect disappeared after excluding the subjects with polysubstance use/and or comorbid psychiatric disorders from the analysis (Supplementary Material, Tables 8(a) and (b)).
Hippocampal shape
We found no group differences, in terms of the longitudinal change on hippocampal shape. We did find a marginal effect of time on the different sub regions of the hippocampus (Supplementary Material, Figure 3); however this did not sur - vive multiple comparison correction. The uncorrected results (of CB users and HCs combined) showed increased volume in the tail or the posterior part of the hippocampus, i.e. near the fornix, and a decrease in the head or the anterior part of the hip-pocampus, i.e. near the junction with the amygdala. There were no effects of cannabis use characteristics (i.e. age of onset of regular use, lifetime cumulative dosage and dosage change between baseline and follow up) on the changing of hippocam-pal shape.Discussion
This is the first longitudinal examination of hippocampal neuro-anatomical changes in young adults over a three-year time period. Contrary to our hypothesis, heavy cannabis users showed no sig-nificant differences compared to healthy controls in volume nor shape of the hippocampus, neither cross-sectionally, nor over time. Over time, both cannabis users and controls showed overall increases in hippocampal volume, with non-significant enlarge-ments in the tail and shrinkage in the head of the hippocampus. We found no effect of age of onset of regular use, lifetime cumu-lative dose or dose change on hippocampal neuroanatomical change. These data suggests that cannabis users show the same developmental trends as normative samples and that heavy can-nabis use in this group may not necessarily interfere with hip-pocampal changes in neuroanatomy in early adulthood.

Adjusted hippocampal volumes (mm3) per group, mean of left and right (blue squares: healthy controls, green triangles: cannabis users) and time point (for each group, left: baseline, right: follow-up). The bars represent mean values for hippocampal volumes. There was a significant effect of time, with larger volumes on follow-up for both groups. 1032 Journal of Psychopharmacology 31(8)
Previous cross sectional studies did find significant differ - ences in hippocampal volume between cannabis users and con-trols (Ashtari et al., 2011; Demirakca et al., 2011; Lorenzetti et al., 2015; Matochik et al., 2005; Yücel et al., 2008). The com-bination of these cross-sectional positive findings and the nega-tive findings of our longitudinal study suggests that cannabis-related changes in hippocampal morphometry might already be present in early adolescence but do not worsen after continued heavy use in late adolescence and early adulthood. Moreover, hippocampal differences could predate the initiation of cannabis use and may represent a vulnerability factor for heavy cannabis use or dependence, rather than a consequence of (heavy) cannabis use. This latter interpretation is supported by studies on alcohol-use disorders, which showed that a smaller temporal lobe (which the hippocampus is an integral part of) is a risk factor rather than a consequence of alcohol abuse. For exam-ple, smaller temporal lobes have been found in non-addicted ado-lescents and adults with a positive family history of alcohol dependence (Benegal et al., 2007; Sjoerds et al., 2013). In con-trast with this vulnerability interpretation, Cheetham et al. (2012) found that adolescents aged 17–18 years who initiated cannabis use (n=28) showed no pre-existing hippocampal abnormalities, suggesting that structural changes in the hippocampus observed in previous studies are a consequence of chronic, heavy cannabis use rather than a premorbid vulnerability.Importantly, in line with the present study, many other cross sectional studies found no evidence for smaller hippocampal vol-umes in cannabis users (Ashtari et al., 2011; Block et al., 2000; Cousijn et al., 2012; Demirakca et al., 2011; Gilman et al., 2014; Lorenzetti et al., 2015; Matochik et al., 2005; Medina et al., 2007; Tzilos et al., 2005; Yücel et al., 2008). Differences in the level of exposure to cannabis may partly explain these inconsist-encies. Smaller hippocampal volumes were mostly reported in samples with high levels of cannabis exposure (Lorenzetti et al., 2013). Also Demirakca et al. (2011) reported that hippocampal volume differences between cannabis users and controls depended on the levels of THC relative to cannabidiol (CBD), the main active cannabinoids in cannabis. However, it is unlikely that the cannabis exposure rate in present study was too low to cause changes in hippocampal neuroanatomy as we recruited heavy, long-term cannabis smokers (using on average five days a week, 0.6 g per day for seven years). This is comparable to the amount of cannabis used by the participants in the study of Demirakca et al. (2011), who did report cross-sectional differ - ences in hippocampal volume. Participants in that study smoked on average seven days a week, 0.27 g per day. Also Ashtari et al. (2011) reported cross-sectional differences in a sample that used 3 g per day, but was abstinent for an average of seven months. In addition, heavy cannabis use often co-occurs with a broad range of psychological problems and use of other substances and alco-hol. By excluding such participants in the present study, we may have biased the sample towards a more high-functioning group of cannabis users. This may explain our finding and this is sup-ported by higher levels of alcohol use/mental problems in studies that did find a differenceOur results suggest that heavy cannabis use may not interfere with developmental and gender effects on hippocampal neuro-anatomy in young adults. Consistent with previous evidence (Lenroot and Giedd, 2010), we found that males had larger hip-pocampal volumes on both BL and FU assessment. In addition, both cannabis users and controls showed overall hippocampal volume increases, which is consistent with findings in normative samples (Ostby et al., 2009). Regarding the shape analyses, we found non-significant enlargements in the tail and shrinkage in the head. Gogtay (2006) reported similar results in a cross sectional study, with a volume increase in posterior and a decrease in ante-rior sub regions (Gogtay et al., 2006). Our results concerning hip-pocampal shape were not statistically significant, which may be due to the stringent multiple comparisons correction and the need to exclude a proportion of data due to failed preprocessing (left hemisphere: 5/43, 11%, right hemisphere: 4/43, 9%). In conclu-sion, although the present study may have been insufficiently powered to detect subtle changes in hippocampal subregional shape, our findings do point to a gender difference in hippocampal volumes and an increase over time in young adults.Regarding age of onset we found that an earlier age of onset was (non-significant, p=0.086) associated with more marked increase of hippocampal volumes over time. This trend effect was independent of cumulative dose and change in dose. When taking the normal developmental trajectory into account (with hippocampal volumes increasing until late adulthood (Goddings et al., 2014; Ostby et al., 2009), and subsequently slightly pla-teauing or decreasing (Ostby et al., 2009) a larger volume increase in the early onset cannabis users could indicate a ‘delayed’ developmental trajectory, i.e. hippocampal volumes of cannabis users starting at a younger age increase more during young adulthood. Although in need of empirical testing, this could mean that hippocampal volumes might reach a normative volume over time, although delayed. This delay in development could be an explanation for the adverse effects that are found in early onset cannabis users, like early school leaving (Lynskey et al., 2003) and poorer cognitive function (Gruber et al., 2012). This may indicate an adverse effect of cannabis use at an early age on the hippocampus or an association between hippocampal volume and the vulnerability for early start of cannabis use. However, due to the relatively small numbers the present study might have been underpowered to detect smaller hippocampal volume in association with earlier cannabis use. Future longitudi-nal studies in larger samples of regular cannabis users should further evaluate the role of early onset cannabis use on the devel-oping hippocampus.
Strengths and limitations
For the first time, this study examined whether continued canna-bis use has an effect on changes in hippocampal neuroanatomy over time, using a within-subject design. The detailed measure-ment of cannabis variables (age of onset of regular use, lifetime cumulative dose or dose change) in the examined cannabis group allowed us to study the influence of potential mediating varia-bles, including cannabis dose and age of onset. Last, the use of manual tracing has the benefit of enhanced sensitivity to subtle effects in hippocampal shape and greater precision in detecting inter-individual variability in anatomical boundaries when com-pared to the application of automated protocols (Stjepanovic et al., 2013). Manual tracing also allows shape analyses, enabling the examination of whether cannabis use affects specific hip-pocampal subregions (Gilman et al., 2014).This study however also has some limitations. First, confound-ing factors that also affect brain neuroanatomy (psychopathology  Koenders et al. 1033
and comorbid substance use) may have affected our findings. Cannabis users were diagnosed more often with psychiatric disor - ders (depressive disorders, n=3 and ADHD, n=3). In addition, in comparison with controls, cannabis users used on average a higher amount of cigarettes and other drugs. We controlled for these potential confounding effects by repeating the analyses with and without individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders, and with higher levels of use of substances other than cannabis. This did not influence our pattern of results. Alcohol use was matched between the groups, and did not affect our findings. Second, our sample did not contain subjects that were cannabis-naïve at the start of the study and then started to use cannabis persistently for at least three years. Therefore we cannot rule out the possibilities that hippocampal volumes were affected during the early course of cannabis use or the change in volumes was related to factors influencing the onset of cannabis use. Future studies such as the prospective Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD; NIMH, USA) study will hopefully be able to distinguish if tempo-ral lobe deficits represent a vulnerability factor for or a conse-quence of heavy cannabis use.In conclusion, our current findings confirm our previous VBM findings in the same cohort (Koenders et al., 2016), sug-gesting that cannabis use does not affect hippocampal neuroana-tomical changes in early adulthood, since cannabis users showed similar developmental trends as normative samples. However, since other studies have suggested detrimental effects of (heavy) cannabis use on both cognitive and other MRI measures, there is a need for future longitudinal studies in larger samples of regular cannabis users to confirm the role of early onset cannabis use on the developing brain.

https://www.monash.edu/pharm/about/news/alchemy/issue-34/140-years-of-commercialisation-innovation-and-entrepreneurship/a-thousand-flowers-bloom,A thousand flowers bloom: The 21st century,,"You are here: The 21st century has seen seismic changes in technology and in pharmaceutical sciences. Advancements in research and technology have made new things possible, in terms of pharmacy research, drug discovery and practice. It’s an exciting time. The college, which became Monash University’s Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences in 2008, seized on these opportunities under the leadership of Deans Colin Chapman and Bill Charman. The entrepreneurial spirit that characterised the Victorian College of Pharmacy from the beginning is stronger than ever, though the commercial activities of the faculty now operate on a scale that might have seen Joseph Bosisto and John Kruse reaching for the ammonium carbonate “smelling salts”. In the last 20 years, the faculty has woven together many of its pre-existing strengths and capabilities into something far more coordinated and strategic. There’s been a focus on building capacity to conduct research at all stages of the drug-discovery pipeline, and on articulating the faculty’s research strengths, through the creation of three Therapeutic Program Areas: Neuroscience and Mental Health, Global Health and Cardiovascular and Metabolic Health. The faculty now acts as a key presence in the thriving Victorian pharmacy industry ecosystem, driving and supporting research, manufacturing and entrepreneurial activities. Faculty research teams have secured lucrative deals with multinational pharmaceutical companies, graduates are launching exciting start-ups and faculty members have continued to launch new spin-off companies, building on the success of Biota and Acrux. The faculty has built on the international networks established in earlier eras to broaden its global influence and perspective, too. The global outlook is reflected in the student body, with increasing numbers of international students studying pharmacy at Monash, enriching and expanding the networks of graduates and faculty. It’s also reflected in the faculty’s industry and research partnerships, which stretch to many corners of the planet. Meanwhile, global health has become a key therapeutic priority. Researchers at Parkville are tackling malaria and COVID-19 among other wicked problems of global health. In the same year that the college became a faculty within Monash University, 2008, it also established the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (MIPS). From its inception, the vision of founding Director Bill Charman was for the institute  to be more than the research arm of a university faculty. It represented a new kind of research model; the MIPS structure was designed to facilitate industry collaboration, to foster multidisciplinary research teams and to incubate new commercial opportunities. It’s done exactly that. Under the leadership of Professor Charman and later his successor Professor Chris Porter, the newly established MIPS quickly integrated and established some star research teams. These teams collaborated on projects and continue to do incredible work into the 2020s. Today, MIPS research teams are working across all phases of the drug-development life cycle, from target to molecule to optimised preclinical drug candidates to clinical trials, manufacturing support and safe prescription practices. Over the years, MIPS teams have nurtured commercial partnerships with organisations including Servier, GSK, Starpharma, Takeda, Johnson & Johnson and more. The Centre for Drug Candidate Optimisation (CDCO), which started up in 2003, has filled a crucial gap in drug development. Led today by Professor Susan Charman, the CDCO runs as a quasi-commercial service for biotech companies, startups and non-profits seeking to identify and optimise drug candidates. The team studies the absorption, distribution, metabolism and extraction properties of new drug candidates – identifying limitations in drug design early in the development process. The Drug Discovery Biology theme – originally led by Professors Patrick Sexton, Arthur Christopoulos and Roger Summers – is now fronted by Professor Rebecca Ritchie, late of The Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute. It was integrated from the Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences at Clayton, into MIPS, in 2009. From the beginning, the theme’s work focused on the early phase of drug development, including target identification, target validation, hit discovery, mechanism of action, and proof of concept. Under Professor Ritchie’s leadership, it is now building strength in translational pharmacology. Led for twenty years by Professor Peter Scammells, the Medicinal Chemistry Theme pre-existed MIPS. It has proven fertile ground for collaboration with other  research institutions, with the establishment of major platforms in the shape of the  Australian Translational Medicinal Chemistry Facility and the Monash Fragment Platform. Professor Scammells is stepping down from the leadership, but will remain as the Faculty's Associate Dean Research, and Associate Professor Ben Capuano will serve as interim leader while an international search is conducted for a replacement. With its focus on developing next-generation drug-delivery systems to enhance drug exposure and action, the Drug Delivery Disposition and Dynamics Theme is a natural collaborator for industry partners (see the stories about Puretech and Starpharma elsewhere in this piece, for example, alongside the work led by Professor Roger Nation and Professor Jian Li to develop a novel antibiotic to combat superbugs, in collaboration with US firm QPex Biopharma). Longtime theme leader Colin Pouton has recently stepped down, in part to focus on helping develop domestic mRNA manufacturing, with Professor Michelle McIntosh serving as interim leader. Following in the footsteps of the original vision of the IDT, the Medicines Manufacturing Innovation Centre is another crucial team within MIPS. MMIC supports pharmaceutical manufacturers and allied industries in optimising manufacturing processes. Meanwhile, the Centre for Medicine Use and Safety (CMUS) researches and develops new models of healthcare practice, especially those involving pharmacists, with the aim of improving safety and efficacy in medicine use. Professor Susan Charman studied in the US and worked in the pharmaceutical industry before moving to Monash to assume an academic role at the faculty. She has devoted much of her career to seeking new drug candidates to treat neglected and tropical infectious diseases, especially malaria. For decades she’s been a key player in drug discovery for the Medicines for Malaria venture. Charman is a prolific and widely cited scientist, who has published over 170 peer-reviewed scientific manuscripts and is a named inventor on 10 patents. Today Charman is the Director of the Centre for Drug Candidate Optimisation, leading a team of 25  research scientists and postdoctoral fellows who undertake physicochemical, metabolism and pharmacokinetic investigations to  inform drug candidate design and progression.  The faculty’s research covers a range of diseases, but most research is currently concentrated on three major therapeutic areas: neuroscience and mental health, cardiovascular and metabolic health and global health. Following the success of Acrux, drug delivery research within the faculty has led to the spin-out of some exciting new commercial entities in recent years. MIPS partnered with the University of Melbourne in 2016 to form Biocurate. Biocurate aims to accelerate the translation of basic medical research into human therapeutics. It’s an independent entity charged with removing early-stage obstacles to providing researchers with pathways to commericalise their findings. Faculty researchers have made major advancements and seized commercial opportunities in drug development, too. In 2017, MIPS announced the licensing of a lymphatic drug targeting technology platform to clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company PureTech Health. And in 2018, Cincera Therapeutics launched with a $7 million venture capital commitment from the Medical Research Commercialisation Fund. The company was another MIPS spin-off, founded by Associate Professor Bernard Flynn from MIPS and Professor Stuart Pitson from the Centre for Cancer Biology. The company primarily develops therapies for metabolic syndromes and type-2 diabetes-related diseases. MIPS people are making an impact across the globe developing creative strategies, treatments and technologies with the power to save many lives. Craig Rayner, a former MIPS academic and college alumnus, has dedicated much of his career to accelerating drug development and drug access on a global scale. He created his own company, d3 Medicine, acquired by Certara in 2016, to address the systematic research and development failures that frustrate drug development and access, especially in the developing world. For many years, the CDCO has had a longstanding collaboration with the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV). Several of these projects have progressed into trials. One such project is a ""next generation"" ozonide drug candidate, aimed at curing malaria with a single oral dose. A MIPS team led by Professor Michelle McIntosh has developed an ingenious solution to a deadly problem for mothers in developing countries: inhalable oxytocin to help prevent postpartum haemorrhage (PPH). In many parts of the world, PPH is the single-largest cause of death for women after childbirth. Unlike injected oxytocin, the inhalable dry-powder form of oxytocin doesn’t need to be refrigerated and doesn’t need to be administered by a trained medical professional. MIPS worked closely on this project with a range of industry partners including GlaxoSmithKline in London. And in 2020, MIPS professor Colin Pouton’s team used mRNA science to produce three new vaccine candidates for COVID-19. They were the first team in Australia to do so. Victoria’s pharmaceuticals sector soared in the second half of the 2010s, contributing more than $2.2 billion in exports in 2018 compared to just $873 million in 2014. According to Victoria’s Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions Melbourne-based companies currently make up over 40 per cent of all ASX-listed medtech and pharmaceutical firms in Australia, and employ around 31,000 people. Local manufacturing innovation remains a crucial element of the Australian pharmacy ecosystem, even as the industry’s focus has turned more towards research and intellectual property in recent years. MIPS has carved out a niche within this ecosystem, making strides – and big plans – in vaccine-manufacturing technologies. It’s creating jobs and bolstering Australia’s medicine security in the process. Among the biggest success stories is the collaboration between Medicines Manufacturing Innovation Centre and GlaxoSmithKline Australia to use blow-fill-seal (BFS) technology to manufacture vaccines. The MMIC team have proven agile in their model. They offer formulation development services and expertise in product development beyond just human medicines. Their activities have extended into veterinary products, medical devices, cosmetics and nutraceutical products. Professor Michelle McIntosh is a pharmaceutical scientist with an international reputation in the fields of pulmonary (mouth-inhaled) drug delivery and global health. McIntosh completed her undergraduate and PhD studies at Monash University before moving in 1999 to the University of Kansas, Center for Drug Delivery Research. Since 2006, she’s continued her research at Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences. McIntosh’s award-winning research has focused on improving access to life- saving medications for birthing mothers in the developing world. She’s developing a novel aerosol delivery system for oxytocin. In 2017 McIntosh was co-awarded the John Dixon Hughes Medal for Medical Research Innovation. Today she’s the director of the HMSTrust Laboratory, an open access analytical laboratory at Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences and the director of the Medicines Manufacturing Innovation Centre (MMIC). Her wide research interests embrace medicinal cannabis in the treatment of paediatric epilepsy and targeted antibiotic treatment for respiratory infections.  After a global search for a new dean in 2019, the faculty found the right person in one of its own labs in Parkville. Professor Arthur Christopoulos, a graduate of the Victorian College of Pharmacy, and a star researcher in the Drug Discovery Biology theme, is building on the huge strides made during Professor Bill Charman’s tenure as dean. Multidisciplinary collaboration and manufacturing capacity are two key components of Christopoulos’s vision. MIPS researchers are playing a key role in the frontiers of mental illness treatment with the launch of the ambitious new Neuromedicines Discovery Centre. The faculty has launched a new degree, the Master of Pharmaceutical Science, designed in consultation with industry, to address emerging skills gaps and in anticipation of the exciting new products and possibilities in the biomedical field. And earlier this year, as part of a partnership with IDT Australia, MIPS received Australia’s first mRNA vaccine manufacturing machine. The machine will enable Pouton’s team to progress their COVID-19 vaccine candidates to clinical trial and will ultimately enable Victoria to produce COVID vaccines. These facilities will also enable world-leading MIPS drug-developers to respond quickly to other novel diseases and viruses in the future. Monash pharmaceutical science graduates have used their knowledge and expertise to launch a new business in the world of cosmetics. Libby Le and Este Tschung both studied Pharmaceutical Sciences at Monash but first met while working at global skincare company Aesop after graduating. They became friends and entrepreneurs, cofounding Splendr, an online beauty store that makes high-demand and cult global beauty products available to Australian consumers. A lot has changed since the early pharmacists of Victoria grappled with logistics, supply and the other problems of distance; since Felton and Grimwade started their glass factory after too many broken bottles came off the ship, or since George Nicholas made his own aspirin, after Germany cut supply during the First World War. But ingenuity, energy and a drive for self-sufficiency characterised the industry in Victoria then as now – from Bosisto’s eucalyptus oil to mRNA technology.

Monash University's new Master of Pharmaceutical Science culminates in an extended placement with a major employer in the biomedical research, pharmaceutical manufacturing or allied industries. The longer placement means that students can achieve more, offer a greater benefit to potential employers and be trained on a grater range of instrumentation. Monash has over 30 industry partners that offer our pharmaceutical science students placements. The Master of Pharmaceutical Science has been designed in consultation with major employers across the pharmaceutical sector, to ensure that the course content aligns with areas in the sector where there are skill gaps.

 ABSTRACTSCOVID-19, PANDEMIC MEDIA ANDTHE SOCIAL IMAGINARYAngela Ndalianis, Director, Centrefor Transformative MediaTechnologies, Swinburne Universityof TechnologyWhether taking the form of films, socialmedia exchanges, or memes, since thearrival of the coronavirus, pandemicmedia have taken centre stage inmediating collective life on a globalscale and have become embedded inand give expression to our socialimaginary. In this roundtable, I willexamine the dialogue that takes placebetween pandemic media –films, TVshows, social media–and humanperception of the COVID-19pandemic. For example, the recentdystopian, science fiction film Songbird(Adam Mason 2020) imagines COVID-19 as a superbug that has, by 2024,evolved into the deadly Covid-23. Withthe virus having built up antimicrobialresistance, governments have beenforced to set up concentration campsthat house the infected. Whilefundamentally a love story, Songbirdnevertheless uses storytelling toimagine the ‘what if’ scenario of Covid-19 even more out of control. In otherexamples, it is traditional film viewerswho have created their ownimaginings. Here, I will focus on howindividuals living through Covid-19have drawn upon their knowledge ofpandemic media examples (especiallyzombie films/ TV series) to make senseof – seriously, critically, comically – thepandemic through the circulation ofmemes. I will examine how the socialimaginary that is rehearsed acrossthese examples can be a powerfuldiscursive form that reflects real-worldsocial, moral and ethical issues.YOU CAN’T HANDLE THE TRUTH:MEDIA AUDIENCES AND THESOCIAL MOTIVATIONS BEHINDCONSPIRACY ANDMISINFORMATIONAndy Ruddock, School of Media,Film and Journalism, MonashUniversityThe Harvard Kennedy SchoolMisinformation Review has publishedeight articles on the difficulties ofnurturing Covid literacy in global digitalmedia environments in the last year.Seven of these articles focus onaudiences as crucial participants in thecirculation of health information-accurate or otherwise. Whether fanningthe flames of conspiracy theories(Chen et al., 2020; Soares et al., 2021),or bolstering digital barricades againstthe hordes of misinformation (Kim etal., 2021; Siwakoti et al., 2021; Epsteinet al., 2021; Weintraub Austin et al.,2020), media audiences are conceivedhere as much more than the targets ofhealth information.This paper presents a short history ofaudience research to identify some ofthe landmarks and paradoxes thatpartly explain the apparent disorderaround Covid communication. Thathistory suggests that audiencesparticipate in media culture when itrewards them with company,community and esteem. It alsoindicates that the present problem ofaudience fuelled conspiracy andmisinformation is entirely in keepingwith ecologies where industries andaudiences alike have happily shiftedthe weight of political communicationtoward popular culture. In summary,the history of audience researchindicates the social logic that drivessome audiences into the arms ofpandemic obfuscation.IMAGINING AUDIENCES IN A POST-COVID-19 WORLD Monique Lewis, Griffith Centre forSocial and Cultural Research,Griffith University The SARS CoV-2 pandemic hasbrought about unprecedenteddisruption to public health, our socialand mental worlds, our mobilities, andour economies. The magnitude andurgency of the pandemic have beenarticulated at saturation levels in newsstories around the world, making it themost mediatised health event inhistory. COVID news is co-producedby a vast range of different actors whoinfluence the news-making process.Audiences in health news are impliedwithin this construction process, andthe final product – the news story –offers insights into the distinct types of‘imagined audiences’ at play. In thisroundtable discussion I will explorethese possible ‘imagined audiences’implied in news stories and narrativesand will discuss their relevance in thecontext of antimicrobial resistance. Acollectivist worldview is arguably beingcultivated in COVID news stories,where citizens are regarded less asbiomedical individuals and more asagentic ‘public health citizens’ (Hollandand Lewis, forthcoming). This patternwe are witnessing in COVID newsreporting may reverberate andresonate for the post-COVID context,for the benefit of AMR advocacy andreporting.

From suppression to ‘Living with COVID’: The narrative turn Monique Lewis, Griffith Centre for Social and Cultural Research, Griffith University  Video: https://youtu.be/ZZw5GNZ8rks Media narratives that evolve and proliferate during pandemics can be very powerful at a number of levels: they can influence our health beliefs and behaviours, they can engender or dismantle trust, summon a sense of solidarity or fragmentation, and they can legitimise and delegitimise pandemic responses. They can have a highly political function, activated and articulated in government public communications. This presentation will explore COVID narratives and frames that played out in Australia during government press conferences, which became highly mediatised ritual events that not only captured the attention of journalists, but of citizens as well. Of particular interest in this study is how the narrative from the Australian Prime Minister’s press conferences throughout 2021 gradually shifted from ideals of suppression and ‘zero COVID’ in the community to ‘living with COVID’ (or what some critics labelled #letitrip). Based on a research project with my colleagues at the Griffith Centre for Social and Cultural Research, in this presentation I will identify and unravel some key moments in the press conference discourse that signalled this narrative turn, the main actors involved, the processes that led to the embracing (and resistance) of the new ‘living with COVID’ narrative, and the consequences of this new narrative.

Andy Ruddock, School of Media, Film and Journalism, Monash University Video: https://youtu.be/sdwjI4j3JNM In September 2021, violent protests against Victorian Covid restrictions and a social media entrepreneur called Avi Yemini turned Australia’s pandemic crisis into a media branding exercise. This transition represented ‘digital mainstreaming’. Cultivation analysis developed the mainstreaming concept to explain the political effects of TV violence. According to this concept, screen violence narrows the parameters of public discourse and normalises right of centre dispositions. TV coverage of Melburnian street violence exemplified this effect by placing an alt-right media personality in the middle of a battle between the Australian Broadcasting  Corporation and Sky News Australia over the future of national TV journalism. By examining the Yemini case study, this paper argues that mainstreaming connects histories of politicised mob violence with theories of convergence and mediatisation. A revised mainstreaming concept explains how battles for votes and viewers annexed Australia’s Covid crisis. Bio: Andy's work focusses on new ways to conceive how media make social reality. Andy is author of Exploring Media Research (2017), Youth and Media (2013) Investigating Audiences (2007) and Understanding Audiences (2001). His new book, Digital Influence, explores the histories of phenomena such as representations of gender in film and reality TV, violence in political memes, the mainstreaming of populism, gun-control activism and public criticisms of media education.","Her research has focused on news media representations of COVID-19, medicinal cannabis, complementary medicine, and public health campaigns, ...",3,528

Background
Globally, cannabis use is prevalent and widespread. There are currently no pharmacotherapies approved for treatment of cannabis use
disorders.
This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in the Cochrane Library in Issue 12, 2014.
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapies as compared with each other, placebo or no pharmacotherapy (supportive
care) for reducing symptoms of cannabis withdrawal and promoting cessation or reduction of cannabis use.
Search methods
We updated our searches of the following databases to March 2018: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),
MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Web of Science.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs involving the use of medications to treat cannabis withdrawal or to promote cessa-
tion or reduction of cannabis use, or both, in comparison with other medications, placebo or no medication (supportive care) in people
diagnosed as cannabis dependent or who were likely to be dependent.
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included 21 RCTs involving 1755 participants: 18 studies recruited adults (mean age 22 to 41 years); three studies targeted young people
(mean age 20 years). Most (75%) participants were male. The studies were at low risk of performance, detection and selective outcome
reporting bias. One study was at risk of selection bias, and three studies were at risk of attrition bias.
All studies involved comparison of active medication and placebo. The medications were diverse, as were the outcomes reported, which
limited the extent of analysis.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
Abstinence at end of treatment was no more likely with /uni03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) preparations than with placebo (risk ratio (RR)
0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.52; 305 participants; 3 studies; moderate-quality evidence). For selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers, buspirone and N-acetylcysteine,
there was no difference in the likelihood of abstinence at end of treatment compared to placebo (low- to very low-quality evidence).
There was qualitative evidence of reduced intensity of withdrawal symptoms with THC preparations compared to placebo. For other phar-
macotherapies, this outcome was either not examined, or no significant differences was reported.
Adverse effects were no more likely with THC preparations (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.17; 318 participants; 3 studies) or N-acetylcysteine
(RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.23; 418 participants; 2 studies) compared to placebo (moderate-quality evidence). For SSRI antidepressants,
mixed action antidepressants, buspirone and N-acetylcysteine, there was no difference in adverse effects compared to placebo (low- to
very low-quality evidence).
There was no difference in the likelihood of withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects with THC preparations, SSRIs antidepres-
sants, mixed action antidepressants, anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers, buspirone and N-acetylcysteine compared to placebo (low-
to very low-quality evidence).
There was no difference in the likelihood of treatment completion with THC preparations, SSRI antidepressants, mixed action antidepres-
sants and buspirone compared to placebo (low- to very low-quality evidence) or with N-acetylcysteine compared to placebo (RR 1.06,
95% CI 0.93 to 1.21; 418 participants; 2 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers appeared to reduce the
likelihood of treatment completion (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.92; 141 participants; 3 studies; low-quality evidence).
Available evidence on gabapentin (anticonvulsant), oxytocin (neuropeptide) and atomoxetine was insufficient for estimates of effective-
ness.
Authors' conclusions
There is incomplete evidence for all of the pharmacotherapies investigated, and for many outcomes the quality of the evidence was low or
very low. Findings indicate that SSRI antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, bupropion, buspirone and atomoxetine are probably
of little value in the treatment of cannabis dependence. Given the limited evidence of efficacy, THC preparations should be considered
still experimental, with some positive effects on withdrawal symptoms and craving. The evidence base for the anticonvulsant gabapentin,
oxytocin, and N-acetylcysteine is weak, but these medications are also worth further investigation.

Medicines for the treatment of cannabis dependence
Background
Cannabis use is relatively common and widespread worldwide. Demand by cannabis users for treatment has been increasing in most
regions of the world. Moves in some countries to decriminalise or legalise cannabis use is likely to result in this trend continuing. Currently
there are no medicines specifically for the treatment of cannabis use. This review sought to assess the effectiveness and safety of medicines
for the treatment of cannabis dependence.
Search date
We searched the scientific literature in March 2018.
Study characteristics
We identified 21 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are allocated at random to one of two or more treatment
groups) involving 909 participants treated with active medicines, and 846 who received placebo (a pretend treatment). Key features of
dependent drug use are compulsive use, loss of control over use and withdrawal symptoms on cessation of drug use. This review included
studies where participants were described as dependent or were likely to be dependent based on cannabis use occurring several days a
week, or daily.
The mean age of participants in individual studies ranged from 22 to 41 years, excluding three studies that targeted young people. Most
(75%) study participants were male. Most (16) of the studies were undertaken in the USA, with three occurring in Australia, one in Canada
and one in Israel. The studies tested a wide range of medicines to reduce the symptoms of cannabis withdrawal and to promote cessation
or reduction of cannabis use.
Four studies received study medicines from the manufacturing pharmaceutical company but none were funded by pharmaceutical com-
panies. One study did not report funding or medicine source.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
For the outcome of abstinence at the end of treatment, /uni03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the major constituent in cannabis) preparations
were probably ineffective; antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mixed action antidepressants, a medicine called
buspirone and a medicine called N-acetylcysteine may also have been ineffective; and we are uncertain about the effect of anticonvulsants
and mood stabilisers.
For the outcome of completion of the scheduled period of treatment, THC preparations, mixed action antidepressants, anticonvulsants
and mood stabilisers may not have been effective, we were uncertain about the effect of SSRI antidepressants, and N-acetylcysteine prob-
ably did not support treatment completion. The use of anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers may have increased the likelihood that peo-
ple le/f_t treatment early.
THC preparations and N-acetylcysteine were probably no more likely to cause side effects than placebo, mixed action antidepressants
and buspirone may have been no more likely to cause side effects than placebo, and we were uncertain about SSRI antidepressants.
Based on current research, all medicines should be considered still experimental.
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the evidence for many of the outcomes in this review was low or very low because each medicine was investigated by a
small number of studies (ranging from one to four), each study involved small numbers of participants, there was some inconsistency in
the findings and there was a risk of bias due to study participants dropping out of treatment.

Description of the condition
Cannabis production and consumption is highly prevalent and
widespread globally ( World Drug Report 2017 ). It is estimated that
3.8% of the global adult population used cannabis in the past year
(World Drug Report 2017 ).
Cannabis use disorders are the reason for treatment in around half
the people seeking treatment for the first time at the global lev-
el (World Drug Report 2017 ). Cannabis is identified as the primary
drug of concern for more than half of people in treatment for drug
use in Africa and Oceania (World Drug Report 2017 ). Cannabis use
within some indigenous communities in North America and Aus-
tralia may be more prevalent than for their non-indigenous coun-
terparts ( Beauvais 2004 ; Clough 2004 ).
The main psychoactive compound in all cannabis products is
/uni03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; EMCDDA Cannabis Drug Profile ).
Cannabis use causes significant adverse effects ( Budney 2007a ).
The acute effects of short-term cannabis use include impaired
memory ( Solowij 2008 ); impaired motor co-ordination with an as-
sociated increased risk of involvement in motor vehicle accidents
(Hall 2009 ); altered judgement; and, in high doses, paranoia and
psychosis ( Volkow 2014). Long-term or heavy use of cannabis has
been associated with: the development of dependence ( Budney
2007a), chronic bronchitis and increased risk of chronic psychotic
disorders in people with a predisposition for development of such
disorders ( Volkow 2014). When use is commenced early in adoles-
cence, long-term or heavy cannabis use has also been associated
with altered brain development, poor educational outcome (Silins
2014; Silins 2015 ), cognitive impairment ( Solowij 2008 ), and dimin-
ished life satisfaction and achievement (Gruber 2003 ).
One study using a large epidemiological survey in the USA estimat-
ed that 47.4% of males and 32.5% of females exposed to cannabis in
their lifetime will develop a cannabis use disorder. For most people,
the disorder would be cannabis abuse by Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria, but ap-
proximately 7.0% of males and 5.3% of females who use cannabis
at some point in their life would be likely to develop cannabis de-
pendence ( Lev-Ran 2013a). It has been estimated that, globally in
2017, more than 19 million people were cannabis dependent (Pea-
cock 2018 ).
As with other drugs of dependence, the risk of developing depen-
dency is influenced by multiple factors. However, intensive use of
cannabis, that is daily or near daily use, is likely to increase the
risk of cannabis dependence (EMCDDA 2004 ). It has been suggest-
ed that the earlier initiation of cannabis use (Copeland 2014 ), use
of more potent forms of cannabis (e.g. the flowering heads of the
female cannabis plant) and the greater use of water-pipes may
have led to an increased amount of THC consumption by some
cannabis users and, therefore, possibly greater rates of cannabis
dependence ( Hall 2001 ).
The use of cannabis has consistently been associated with psychot-
ic symptoms ( Minozzi 2010 ), and may be associated with the earli-
er onset of psychotic illness in some people ( Large 2011). Cannabis
use has been associated with a range of mental health disorders,
such as anxiety and mood disorders ( Lev-Ran 2013b). These as-
sociations are particularly pronounced with bipolar disorder, sub-stance use disorders and specific (antisocial, dependant and histri-
onic) personality disorders ( Lev-Ran 2013b).
Estimates of the number of people who use cannabis and experi-
ence withdrawal are variable (Agrawal 2008 ; Budney 2006 ; Chung
2008; Copersino 2006 ; Cornelius 2008 ; Hasin 2008 ). Evidence re-
garding factors influencing the severity of cannabis withdrawal re-
mains limited, but there is evidence that the amount of cannabis
smoked is predictive of the intensity of withdrawal during absti-
nence from cannabis (McClure 2012 ). Smoking behaviour also ap-
pears to be a strong predictor for the severity of cannabis depen-
dence ( van der Pol 2014).
General acceptance of a specific cannabis withdrawal syndrome is
indicated by the inclusion of diagnostic criteria for cannabis with-
drawal in the fi/f_th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ). The DSM-5 defines cannabis withdrawal
by development of three or more of the following signs and symp-
toms within approximately one week of cessation of heavy and pro-
longed cannabis use: 1. irritability, anger or aggression; 2. nervous-
ness or anxiety; 3. sleep difficulty; 4. decreased appetite or weight
loss; 5. restlessness; 6. depressed mood; and 7. at least one of the
following physical symptoms causing significant discomfort: stom-
ach pain, shakiness or tremors, sweating, fever, chills or headache
(DSM-5 ). Onset of symptoms is usually within 24 to 48 hours of
abstinence, reaching peak intensity within the first week (Budney
2007a). Symptoms may persist for up three to four weeks (Milin
2008), although there appears to be significant individual variabili-
ty. Cannabis withdrawal is not life threatening, neither is it associ-
ated with significant medical or psychiatric consequences ( Budney
2003).
Demand for treatment by people who use cannabis has generally
increased worldwide since the mid to late 2000s, albeit with signifi-
cant regional variation. The World Drug Report gives data on treat-
ment demand in terms of the proportion of treatment services pro-
vided for the major drugs of dependence. People who use cannabis
have dominated demand for drug treatment in Africa since the mid
to late 2000s with treatment rates consistently over 60%. Demand
for cannabis treatment has grown significantly in some regions,
more than doubling in Europe and South America and more than
trebling in Oceania ( World Drug Report 2017 ). North America as a
whole was the only region to see a decrease in the contribution of
cannabis to treatment demand (World Drug Report 2017 ), but with-
in the USA, cannabis admissions increased by 32% between 1996
and 2006 ( SAMHSA 2008 ). With moves to decriminalise or legalise
cannabis use in some parts of the world, the trend of increasing de-
mand for treatment is likely to continue.
Increases in the THC content of cannabis may be a factor in the in-
creasing demand for treatment. In the USA, THC content, as detect-
ed in confiscated samples, increased from about 3% in the 1980s to
12% in 2012 ( Volkow 2014). Cannabis users adjust their smoking be-
haviour when smoking stronger cannabis but the adjustment does
not fully compensate for the increased strength (van der Pol 2014).
Hence, cannabis users would be expected to be exposed to high-
er doses of THC as a result of the increasing potency of cannabis
preparations. Cannabis users who seek treatment typically have
a long history of cannabis use disorder and multiple previous at-
tempts to quit (Copeland 2014 ).

Description of the intervention
There are currently no accepted pharmacotherapies for the treat-
ment of cannabis withdrawal or cessation. The identification and
development of medications to fill this gap has long been a prior-
ity among researchers ( Vandrey 2009 ), and a number of pharma-
cotherapies have been proposed as possible experimental inter-
ventions to attenuate the symptoms and signs of cannabis with-
drawal and to promote cessation.
These medications are diverse in nature, encompassing medica-
tions that affect cannabinoid receptor systems (e.g. preparations
of THC), medications that affect dopamine pathways, medications
that affect the specific symptoms of cannabis withdrawal or that
have been used in managing withdrawal from other substances,
and medications that affect mental health conditions, such as de-
pression, that may be factors contributing to cannabis use.
How the intervention might work
The proposed pharmacological interventions may potentially
lessen the symptoms and signs of cannabis withdrawal, including
craving. The availability of effective pharmacotherapy for cannabis
withdrawal may encourage people who are cannabis dependent to
enter treatment, and may increase the rates of completion of with-
drawal, cessation of cannabis use and entry into relapse prevention
treatment.
It has been reported that the experience of cannabis withdraw-
al symptoms may be a significant obstacle to the achievement
of abstinence by people who are cannabis dependent (Budney
2006; Copeland 2001 ; Hart 2005 ). Therefore, the effective treatment
of the cannabis withdrawal syndrome may promote cessation of
cannabis use and provide a first step towards abstinence and re-
covery.
Why it is important to do this review
As discussed above, there is increasing recognition that cannabis
use and dependence is an important public health issue.
Not all people who use cannabis will need pharmacotherapies to
manage withdrawal or support cessation of their use. However, it
is important that effective pharmacotherapies are identified for the
treatment of cannabis withdrawal, especially in intensive cannabis
users who describe withdrawal symptoms on cessation. As such,
with the increase in the number of pharmacotherapies tested, this
review sought to establish current knowledge on the effectiveness
of different medications in the treatment of cannabis dependence.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that provided
detailed information on the type and dose of intervention medica-
tion used and the characteristics of participants treated.
Types of participants
We included studies that involved participants diagnosed as
cannabis dependent or who were likely to be dependent based on
reported dose, duration and frequency of use (daily or multiple
days per week).
We included studies involving participants dependent on, and
withdrawing from, both cannabis and nicotine, but excluded stud-
ies involving participants dependent on and withdrawing from sub-
stances other than cannabis and nicotine.
We included studies undertaken in either inpatient or outpatient
settings. We excluded studies undertaken in purely research set-
tings, such as residential research laboratories. Some of these stud-
ies provide insight into the effect of different medications on signs
and symptoms of cannabis withdrawal and are considered in the
'Discussion' section. However, such studies generally involved par-
ticipants who were not seeking treatment for cannabis use and ces-
sation of cannabis use was not the goal of the interventions provid-
ed, and the nature of outcomes assessed were generally different to
those expected of treatment interventions. For these reasons, we
excluded such studies from this review.
We excluded studies involving participants with diagnosed schizo-
phrenia and cannabis use disorder. The primary therapeutic goal
in these studies was management of psychotic symptoms, with
consideration of the effect of different antipsychotic medications
on cannabis use. This limits the application of findings of such
studies to the general group of people with cannabis use disor-
ders. Cannabis use in schizophrenia is considered by a separate
Cochrane Review (McLoughlin 2014 ).
Types of interventions
Experimental interventions involved the administration of any
medication with the aim of reducing the symptoms and signs of
cannabis withdrawal or promoting cessation of cannabis use.
Comparison interventions involved the use of different pharma-
cotherapies, placebo or no pharmacotherapy (supportive care).
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
1.Number of participants abstinent from cannabis at the end of
treatment as determined by self-report or urine drug screens, or
both.
2.Intensity of withdrawal as determined by scores on withdrawal
scales, the need for symptomatic medications in addition to the
experimental intervention or overall assessments by clinicians
and participants.
3.Nature, incidence and frequency of adverse effects and whether
the planned medication regimen was modified in response to
adverse effects.

4.Completion of scheduled treatment.
Secondary outcomes
1.Level of cannabis use at the end of treatment as measured via
participant-reported level of use or urine drug screens, or both.
2.Number of participants engaged in further treatment following
completion of the withdrawal intervention. As discussed in the
'Background' section, treatment of the cannabis withdrawal pe-
riod may be considered as the first step in treatment, there-
fore engagement in further relapse prevention treatment may
be considered to be a valid outcome of interest.
Search methods for identification of studies
All searches included non-English language literature. We found no
studies in languages other than English.
Electronic searches
We searched:
1.Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the
Cochrane Library 2018, Issue 2;
2.MEDLINE (1946 to week 3 March 2018) via Ovid Online;
3.Embase Online (26 March 2018);
4.PsycINFO (1806 to week 3 March 2018) via Ovid Online;
5.Web of Science, online (26 March 2018).
We developed a search strategy to retrieve references relating to
the pharmacological treatment of cannabis withdrawal. This strat-
egy was adapted to each of the databases listed above.
For details see Appendix 1 ; Appendix 2 ; Appendix 3 ; Appendix 4 ; Ap-
pendix 5 .
We also searched the following electronic sources of ongoing trials:
1.ANZCTR registry (January 2018);
2.ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ; January 2018).
Searching other resources
We checked the reference lists of relevant review articles and re-
trieved studies to identify any further studies of interest that were
not retrieved by the electronic search. We contacted selected re-
searchers who were active in the area seeking information about
unpublished study reports. We also checked conference proceed-
ings likely to contain trials relevant to the review.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two authors (LG and SN or PS) independently assessed the titles
and abstracts of records retrieved from the systematic search ac-
cording to the identified inclusion and exclusion criteria. All authors
agreed on the inclusion and exclusion decisions. We made no at-
tempt to blind the authors to the names of the study authors, insti-
tutions, journal of publication and results when applying eligibility
criteria.
Data extraction and management
Two authors (LG and SN) extracted key information from the in-
cluded studies using a data collection form to record informationagainst the outcome measures (abstinence, intensity of withdraw-
al, adverse effects, completion of treatment, change in cannabis
use and engagement in follow-up treatment) and study character-
istics (location, participant characteristics, interventions, study de-
sign and source of funding). We confirmed data by consultation
with the other review authors. We summarised key findings of stud-
ies descriptively in the first instance and considered the capacity
for quantitative meta-analysis.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
We assessed the risk of bias of included studies according to the ap-
proach recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Re-
views of Interventions  (Higgins 2011 ). This was based on the evalua-
tion of seven specific methodological domains (namely, sequence
generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and
personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome
data,/uni00A0selective outcome reporting and other bias). For each study,
we analysed the seven domains, described them as reported in the
study and provided a final judgement on the likelihood of bias in
terms of low, high or unclear risk of bias. We based these judge-
ments on the criteria indicated by the Cochrane Handbook for Sys-
tematic Reviews of Interventions  (Higgins 2011 ), and their applica-
bility to the addiction field.
In general, subjective outcomes are more prone to performance
and detection bias than objective outcomes. The outcome mea-
sures in this review that included a subjective component were self-
reported cannabis use (including abstinence at the end of treat-
ment) and intensity of withdrawal. When considering the risk of
bias due to blinding of participants and personnel (performance
bias) and blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), we
based the judgement on the outcomes most prone to bias, and also
considered the use of measures, such as urinalysis, to support the
subjective assessment. We only considered incomplete outcome
data for the intensity of withdrawal, change in cannabis use, and
nature and incidence of adverse effects. Retention in treatment
(duration of treatment) and completion of treatment are frequent-
ly primary outcome measures in addiction research. See Appendix
6 for a detailed description of the criteria we considered in the 'Risk
of bias' assessment.
Details of the assessments of risk of bias are included in the Char-
acteristics of included studies  table.
Measures of treatment eﬀect
Where possible, for dichotomous outcomes (e.g. number complet-
ing treatment), we calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence
intervals (CI). There were no continuous data but the intention was
to express continuous outcomes as a mean difference where there
was a comparable outcome measure (e.g. time in treatment) or as
a standardised mean difference where there was variability in the
outcome measure (e.g. withdrawal assessment scales), with 95%
CIs.
Unit of analysis issues
One included study involved three treatment arms (two different
active medications and placebo) ( Carpenter 2009 ). The active med-
ications, compared to placebo, were included in separate compar-
isons thereby avoiding the unit of analysis error of double-count-
ing participants. Where urine drug screens were reported in stud-

ies, the unit of analysis was the number of study participants and
not the number of tests performed.
Dealing with missing data
We contacted original investigators to request missing data, and,
where unpublished data were available, included these in the
analyses and noted in the study record. We also checked Clinicaltri-
als.gov where data were missing. It was also intended to use sensi-
tivity analysis to assess the impact of different approaches to han-
dling missing data, but there were insufficient data for this.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed clinical and methodological heterogeneity by review-
ing the variation between studies in terms of the characteristics
of participants included, the interventions and the reported out-
comes. We grouped studies for analyses by the nature of the med-
ication used (experimental intervention).
We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the Chi 2 test and its P
value, by visual inspection of the forest plots and the I2 statistic. A
P value of the Chi 2 test lower than 0.10 or an I2 statistic of at least
50% indicated significant statistical heterogeneity.
Data synthesis
We used Review Manager 5 for statistical analyses (Review Manager
2014). In all analyses, we used a random-effects model.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
This review aimed to consider the following potential sources of
heterogeneity through subgroup analyses:
1.patterns of cannabis use and the estimated level of THC intake
(as indicated by duration and level of use, number of days of use,
number of uses per day (frequency), modality of use or route of
administration, age at initiation of use);
2.concurrent tobacco smoking;
3.concurrent psychiatric illness and current treatment for a psy-
chiatric illness;
4.the nature of the treatment setting;
5.the nature of adjunct treatment.
None of these analyses were possible due to limitations of the stud-
ies that met the inclusion criteria.
Sensitivity analysis
We did not use risk of bias as a criterion for inclusion in this review.
We intended to assess the impact of risk of bias through sensitivity
analysis. This would have involved considering the overall estimate
of effect with studies with a high risk of bias included or excluded.
Limitations of data reported by the studies that met the inclusion
criteria meant that sensitivity analysis was not possible. However,
we discussed the risk of bias when presenting the results.
Grading of evidence
We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the primary out-
comes using the system developed by the GRADE Working Groupfor grading the quality of evidence (Schűnemann 2013 ). GRADE
takes into account issues not only related to internal validity but
also to external validity, such as directness, consistency, impreci-
sion of results and publication bias. The 'Summary of findings' ta-
bles present the main findings of a review in a transparent and sim-
ple tabular format. In particular, they provide key information con-
cerning the quality of evidence, the magnitude of effect of the in-
terventions examined and the sum of available data on the main
outcomes.
The GRADE system uses the following criteria for assigning grades
of evidence.
1.High: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that
of the estimate of the effect.
2.Moderate: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate:
the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect,
but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.
3.Low: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true ef-
fect may be substantially different from the estimate of the ef-
fect.
4.Very low: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate:
the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the es-
timate of effect.
Grading of the quality of randomised controlled trials is decreased
for the following reasons.
1.Serious (–1) or very serious (–2) study limitation for risk of bias.
2.Serious (–1) or very serious (–2) inconsistency between study re-
sults.
3.Some (–1) or major (–2) uncertainty about directness (the corre-
spondence between the population, the intervention or the out-
comes measured in the studies actually found and those under
consideration in our systematic review).
4.Serious (–1) or very serious (–2) imprecision of the pooled esti-
mate (–1).
5.Publication bias strongly suspected (–1).

Results of the search
Our search strategy identified 1364 records through database
searching and five additional records from other sources. After re-
moving duplicates, there were 809 unique records. We excluded
720 records based on title and abstract and obtained 89 full-text for
further assessment. On reading the full text, we excluded 43 reports
(relating to 34 studies) with reasons (see Characteristics of exclud-
ed studies  table). We included 21 studies (45 reports) in the review
(see Figure 1 ).

Twenty-one randomised controlled trials (45 reports) involving
1755 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review (Allsop
2014; Carpenter 2009 ; Cornelius 2010 ; Frewen 2007; Gray 2012; Gray
2017; Johnston 2014 ; Levin 2004; Levin 2011; Levin 2013; Levin
2016; Mason 2012 ; McRae-Clark 2009; McRae-Clark 2010; McRae-
Clark 2015 ; McRae-Clark 2016; Miranda 2017 ; Penetar 2012 ; Sher-
man 2017 ; Trigo 2018 ; Weinstein 2014 ; see Characteristics of includ-
ed studies  table). In total, 909 participants received active medica-
tion and 846 participants received placebo. One study reported on-
ly the total number of participants (81) and we assumed group sizes
of 41 and 40 ( Frewen 2007). All studies offered participants some
form of psychological therapy in addition to medication or placebo.
All studies involved a comparison between an active medication
and placebo but medications were diverse in nature. The medica-
tions investigated, grouped according to type and mechanism of
action, were:
1.preparations containing THC: dronabinol ( Levin 2011), dronabi-
nol plus lofexidine ( Levin 2016), nabiximols ( Allsop 2014 ; Trigo
2018);
2.selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants:
fluoxetine ( Cornelius 2010 ), escitalopram ( Weinstein 2014 ), vila-
zodone ( McRae-Clark 2016);
3.mixed action antidepressants (noradrenergic and serotoner-
gic effects): nefazodone ( Carpenter 2009 ), mirtazapine ( Frewen
2007), venlafaxine ( Levin 2013);
4.anticonvulsant and mood stabilisers: divalproex sodium ( Levin
2004), gabapentin (Mason 2012 ), lithium ( Johnston 2014 ), topi-
ramate ( Miranda 2017 );
5.atypical antidepressant (dopamine reuptake inhibitor and weak
noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor): bupropion ( Carpenter 2009 ;
Penetar 2012 );
6.anxiolytic (serotonin 5-HT 1A partial agonist): buspirone ( McRae-
Clark 2009 , McRae-Clark 2015);
7.selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor: atomoxetine
(McRae-Clark 2010);
8.supplement promoting glutamate release and modulating N-
methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, N-acetylcysteine: (Gray
2012; Gray 2017); and
9.neuropeptide, oxytocin ( Sherman 2017 ).
All except two of the studies were undertaken in outpatient set-
tings. Allsop 2014  and Johnston 2014  were primarily studies of
cannabis withdrawal, with medication administered in an inpa-
tient (hospital) setting over six or seven days, with follow-up inter-
views after discharge. The scheduled duration for outpatient stud-
ies ranged from three weeks (Penetar 2012 ) to 13 weeks (Carpenter
2009), with 11 to 13 weeks being most common.
Sixteen studies were undertaken in the USA, with three studies in
Australia ( Allsop 2014 ; Frewen 2007; Johnston 2014 ), one study in
Israel ( Weinstein 2014 ), and one in Canada ( Trigo 2018 ). Twentystudies reported the source of funding to be (government) research
grants; the funding source was unclear for one study (Frewen
2007). Five studies received medications from the manufacturing
company ( Allsop 2014 ; Levin 2016; McRae-Clark 2010; McRae-Clark
2016; Trigo 2018 ). Researchers associated with 10 studies declared
past or current associations with pharmaceutical companies. Re-
searchers associated with eight studies declared no conflict of in-
terest. Authors of the remaining studies made no declarations.
Four studies included participants with cannabis use disorders as
well as cannabis dependence, but the majority of participants met
diagnostic criteria for cannabis dependence (Cornelius 2010 ; Levin
2013; Miranda 2017 ; Penetar 2012 ). In the other studies, all partici-
pants were cannabis dependent.
The mean age of study participants ranged from 22 to 41 years, and
for 12 studies it was between 30 and 35 years; one study did not
provide data on age (Penetar 2012 ). The target population for three
studies was adolescents and young adults (Cornelius 2010 ; Gray
2012; Miranda 2017 ). The mean age of participants in these stud-
ies was 21 (Cornelius 2010 ), 19 (Gray 2012), and 20 years (Miranda
2017).
One study did not provide information on the gender of partici-
pants ( Penetar 2012 ); the majority (61% to 93%) of participants in
19 studies were male. Miranda 2017  was notable in having a smaller
proportion (48%) of males.
Participants in two studies had comorbid depression and cannabis
use disorders ( Cornelius 2010 ; Levin 2013), and in one study partici-
pants met diagnostic criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity dis-
order (ADHD) as well as cannabis dependence (McRae-Clark 2010).
Gray 2012 reported that 13.8% of participants had some psychiatric
comorbidity, but 16 studies excluded people with significant or un-
stable psychiatric conditions. One study did not report on this as-
pect (Penetar 2012 ).
Excluded studies
We excluded 34 studies (43 reports) that were potentially rele-
vant to the review and assessed in detail from the review (see Fig-
ure 1; Characteristics of excluded studies  table). The reasons for
exclusion were: study was exploratory (mostly laboratory-based)
research with participants who were not seeking treatment (13
studies); minority of participants were cannabis dependent, or de-
pendence was unclear (six studies); no treatment comparison (six
studies); comparison of antipsychotic drugs for treatment of schiz-
ophrenia with concurrent cannabis use (five studies); no treat-
ment intervention, or no medication treatment (five studies); and
cannabis use was not the main focus of the treatment intervention
(three studies). Five studies were excluded for more than one rea-
son.

studies for each domain, see Figure 2  and Figure 3 .

Allocation
We judged seven studies at unclear risk of bias due to the reporting
of insufficient information on the method of random sequence gen-
eration ( Carpenter 2009 ; Johnston 2014 ; Levin 2004; McRae-Clark
2015; Penetar 2012 ; Sherman 2017 ; Weinstein 2014 ). We judged six
studies at unclear risk of bias due to the reporting of insufficient
information on the method of allocation concealment (Levin 2004;
McRae-Clark 2015; McRae-Clark 2016; Penetar 2012 ; Sherman 2017 ;
Weinstein 2014 ). We judged the remaining studies at low risk of al-
location bias.
Blinding
We considered one study to have an unclear risk of both perfor-
mance and detection bias because insufficient information was re-
ported on the blinding of participants and personnel to make a
judgement ( McRae-Clark 2016). All other studies were at low risk of
performance and detection bias.
Incomplete outcome data
Completion of treatment is a primary outcome measure for this re-
view. Hence, we only considered the risk of bias due to incomplete
data for the outcomes of intensity of withdrawal, adverse effects
and abstinence (or use of cannabis). We judged the risk of bias to
be unclear for two studies (Frewen 2007; Mason 2012 ), and high for
three studies (Levin 2004; Penetar 2012 ; Weinstein 2014 ).
Selective reporting
Frewen 2007 was a secondary analysis of data from a randomised
controlled trial and reported some but not all findings from the
main study. The full report of the study was not available and hence
the risk of reporting bias was unclear. Penetar 2012  did not dis-
cuss adverse effects making it unclear whether adverse effects were
systematically assessed during the study (unclear risk of reporting
bias). On ClinicalTrials.gov, Sherman 2017  indicated ""satisfactionwith therapy"" as a primary outcome but this was not reported in the
publication associated with the study (high risk of reporting bias).
Other potential sources of bias
Johnston 2014  administered two-thirds of participants a benzo-
diazepine for disturbed sleep. Although the use of such medica-
tions were stated to be similar in the two groups, the effect of this
additional medication was unclear. We judged McRae-Clark 2016
to have a high risk of other bias as the placebo group attended a
greater proportion of scheduled visits and hence may have received
more adjunct interventions.
Eﬀects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison /uni03949-Tetrahy-
drocannabinol preparation compared to placebo for cannabis de-
pendence ; Summary of findings 2 Selective serotonin reuptake in-

6 N-acetylcysteine compared to placebo for cannabis dependence
Results are presented for the outcomes identified as relevant to
this review by medication type. Very few studies reported on the
secondary outcome regarding the level of cannabis use; where this
outcome was reported, it was included in the narrative summary
of abstinence at end of treatment. No studies reported on the sec-
ondary outcome of participation in further treatment.
1. Preparations containing /uni03949-tetrahydrocannabinol
Four studies compared preparations containing THC with placebo
(Allsop 2014 ; Levin 2011; Levin 2013; Trigo 2018 ; Summary of find-
ings for the main comparison).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
Participants abstinent at end of treatment
We found no significant difference between THC and placebo in the
proportion of participants abstinent at the end of treatment (RR
0.98, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.52; 305 participants; 3 studies; I2 = 0%; Analy-
sis 1.1).
Withdrawal symptoms and cravings
Preparations containing THC may have been more effective than
placebo in reducing cannabis withdrawal symptoms and cravings.
Allsop 2014  reported that on average it took 3.1 (standard devia-
tion (SD) 3.0) days for withdrawal scores to fall below baseline with
the THC preparation, nabiximols (27 participants), compared with
4.9 (SD 3.16) days for placebo (24 participants). Nabiximols reduced
the withdrawal score 66% on average from baseline compared to
52% for placebo. The group receiving nabiximols had significant-
ly lower levels of cravings, irritability, anger and aggression. Levin
2011 similarly reported a reduction in the withdrawal discomfort
scores for both the dronabinol (79 participants) and placebo (77
participants) groups, but found that participants receiving dron-
abinol experienced a significantly greater drop in their withdraw-
al scores over time. However, Levin 2016 reported that withdrawal
scores decreased over time with no significant effect of treatment
for dronabinol plus lofexidine compared to placebo and in Trigo
2018, total withdrawal scores progressively decreased with time in
treatment, with no significant difference between nabiximols and
placebo groups. In Trigo 2018 , craving similarly decreased in both
groups with time, with no difference between the groups except
around week seven when craving was higher in the placebo group.
Participants experiencing adverse eﬀects
We found no significant difference between THC and placebo in the
proportion of participants experiencing adverse effects (RR 1.02,
95% CI 0.89 to 1.17; 318 participants; 3 studies; I2 = 7%; Analysis
1.2). THC preparations were associated with a higher likelihood of
adverse effects, but these adverse effects were not sufficiently se-
vere to cause withdrawal from treatment.
Participants withdrawn due to adverse eﬀects
We found no significant difference between THC and placebo in the
proportion of participants withdrawn from treatment due to ad-
verse effects (RR 2.72, 95% CI 0.51 to 14.59; 318 participants; 3 stud-
ies; I2 = 0%; Analysis 1.3 ), but the number of events was small re-
sulting in the very wide CIs.
Completion of scheduled treatment
We found no significant difference between THC and placebo in
the proportion of participants completing the scheduled period of
treatment (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.37; 369 participants; 4 studies;
Analysis 1.4 ). There was some heterogeneity between studies (I2 =
53%).
2. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants
Three studies compared SSRI antidepressants with placebo,
including fluoxetine ( Cornelius 2010 ), vilazodone ( McRae-Clark
2016), and escitalopram ( Weinstein 2014 ) (Summary of findings 2 ).
Participants abstinent at end of treatment
We found no significant difference between SSRI antidepressants
and placebo in the proportion of participants abstinent at the endof treatment (RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.89; 128 participants; 2 stud-
ies; Analysis 2.1 ). On cannabis use outcomes more generally, in
McRae-Clark 2016, cannabis use decreased in the vilazodone and
placebo groups by urine tests and self-report, with no group dif-
ferences. In Weinstein 2014 , there was a tendency towards partic-
ipants receiving escitalopram being abstinent at the end of treat-
ment compared to those receiving placebo. However, the high
rates of dropout from treatment in this study introduced a high risk
of bias for this outcome. Cornelius 2010  compared fluoxetine with
placebo and reported that the mean count of criteria for cannabis
abuse or dependence at the end of treatment was 3.88 (SD 2.51)
for 34 participants treated with fluoxetine compared to 3.61 (SD
1.92) for 36 participants receiving placebo. There were no signif-
icant group by time interactions for cannabis or depression out-
comes in this study.
Withdrawal symptoms and craving
Two studies did not consider the intensity of withdrawal (Cornelius
2010; Weinstein 2014 ). McRae-Clark 2016 found no difference in
the mean withdrawal score at the end of treatment between vila-
zodone (6.8, SD 5.6; 28 participants) and placebo (6.7, SD 7.5; 31
participants). Craving also did not differ between the groups (mean
49.9, 95% CI 44.8 to 51.9 for vilazodone, 41 participants; 46.7, 95%
CI 41.5 to 51.9 for placebo, 35 participants).
Participants experiencing adverse eﬀects
We found no difference between SSRI antidepressants and placebo
in the proportion of participants reporting adverse effects (RR 0.76,
95% CI 0.57 to 1.02; 76 participants; 1 study; Analysis 2.2 ).
Participants withdrawn due to adverse eﬀects
We found no difference between SSRI antidepressants and place-
bo in the proportion of participants withdrawn from treatment due
to adverse effects, but the CI is very wide due to the small number
of events (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.16 to 18.04; 76 participants; 1 study;
Analysis 2.3 ).
Completion of scheduled treatment
We found no difference between SSRI antidepressants and placebo
in the proportion of participants completing the scheduled period
of treatment (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.27; 198 participants; 3 stud-
ies; Analysis 2.4 ). There was substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 74%).
Weinstein 2014  reported a high dropout rate with escitalopram and
Cornelius 2010  found no significant difference in rates of comple-
tion of treatment for fluoxetine compared to placebo. McRae-Clark
2016 reported high levels of attrition in both the vilazodone and
placebo groups.
3. Mixed action antidepressants
Three studies examined mixed action antidepressants including
nefazodone ( Carpenter 2009 ), mirtazapine ( Frewen 2007), and ven-
lafaxine ( Levin 2013) (Summary of findings 3 ).
Participants abstinent at end of treatment
We found no significant difference between mixed-action antide-
pressants and placebo in the proportion of participants abstinent
at the end of treatment (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.12 to 5.41; 179 partici-
pants; 2 studies; Analysis 3.1 ). There was substantial heterogeneity
(I2 = 87%).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
In Levin 2013, significantly fewer participants treated with ven-
lafaxine were abstinent at the end of treatment compared to partic-
ipants receiving placebo. In contrast, in Carpenter 2009 , there was
a tendency towards abstinence being more likely with nefazodone
compared to placebo. However, there was no significant difference
in the severity of dependence rating (mean, SD) at the end of treat-
ment for the nefazodone group (2.5, SD 1.4) compared to the place-
bo group (2.3, SD 1.6). Frewen 2007 did not report data suitable for
inclusion in the meta-analysis but stated that mirtazapine had no
effect on cannabis use, with less than 20% of participants reporting
abstinence at day 56.
Withdrawal symptoms and cravings
There was no difference between mirtazapine and placebo (Frewen
2007), or nefazodone and placebo ( Carpenter 2009 ), in the effect on
cannabis withdrawal symptoms. Mirtazapine improved sleep dura-
tion and quality but not sleep disturbances (Frewen 2007).
Participants experiencing adverse eﬀects
We found no significant difference between nefazodone and place-
bo in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse effects
(RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.55; 76 participants; 1 study; Analysis 3.2 ).
However, Carpenter 2009  reported that adverse effects were more
likely to be moderate or severe with nefazodone, with diarrhoea
most common with nefazodone and gastrointestinal upset most
common with placebo.
Participants withdrawn due to adverse eﬀects
We found no significant difference between mixed-action antide-
pressants and placebo in the proportion of participants withdrawn
from treatment due to adverse effects (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.11 to 18.90;
179 participants; 2 studies; I 2 = 28%; Analysis 3.3 ), but the CIs were
very wide due to the small number of events.
Completion of scheduled treatment
We found no significant difference between mixed-action antide-
pressants and placebo in the proportion of participants completing
the scheduled period of treatment (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.21; 169
participants; 2 studies; I 2 = 0%; Analysis 3.4 ).
4. Anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers
The four studies in this group used diverse medications: lithi-
um (Johnston 2014 ), divalproex ( Levin 2004), gabapentin (Mason
2012), and topiramate ( Miranda 2017 ) (Summary of findings 4 ).
Participants abstinent at end of treatment
We found no significant difference between anticonvulsants or
mood stabilisers and placebo in the proportion of participants ab-
stinent at the end of treatment (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.04; 48 par-
ticipants; 2 studies; I 2 = 0%; Analysis 4.1 ).
On outcomes of cannabis use more generally, at follow-up partic-
ipants in Johnston 2014  reported reductions in the mean number
of days of cannabis use in the previous week and mean quantity of
cannabis use, with no significant differences between lithium and
placebo. Levin 2004 reported that at the end of treatment (weeks
seven and eight), participants in the divalproex group reported us-
ing cannabis on (mean, SD) 2.75 (SD 3.55) days per week, compared
to 1.56 (SD 2.34) days per week for the placebo group, and 4.88 (SD
7.58) joints per week compared to 0.99 (SD 1.18) joints per week forthe placebo group. The group by time interaction was not statisti-
cally significant.
Mason 2012  reported a significant reduction in the grams of
cannabis smoked per week, by self-report and urinalysis, and in the
days of use per week for gabapentin compared to placebo.
Miranda 2017  used linear modelling (imputation analysis) to as-
sess cannabis use during treatment with motivational enhance-
ment therapy (MET) plus topiramate or placebo. While the group
differences were not statistically significant, the data suggested
that participants in the topiramate group smoked fewer grams of
cannabis when they used during the final week of the trial (week
six). However, this finding was at risk of bias due to higher rates of
dropout from the topiramate group.
Withdrawal symptoms and cravings
Gabapentin may have ameliorated cannabis withdrawal symptoms
(Mason 2012 ), but it appeared that divalproex did not (Levin 2004),
and lithium affected only some symptoms ( Johnston 2014 ). Lithi-
um (19 participants) did not significantly reduce the total scores
on the cannabis withdrawal scale relative to placebo (19 partic-
ipants), but did significantly reduce the items ""loss of appetite"",
""stomach aches"" and ""nightmares or strange dreams"" (Johnston
2014). The mean change in total withdrawal score from baseline
to the last day of inpatient stay was –1.96 (SD 1.66) for lithium
(16 participants), and –2.45 (SD 1.97) for placebo (22 participants).
There were no significant group differences between divalproex (13
participants) and placebo (12 participants) ( Levin 2004). In Mason
2012, gabapentin (25 participants) was associated with significant
reductions in acute withdrawal symptoms compared to placebo
(25 participants). Miranda 2017  did not report data on intensity of
withdrawal in their study of topiramate.
Participants experiencing adverse eﬀects
There were no data suitable for inclusion in meta-analyses on the
adverse effects of anticonvulsants or mood stabilisers. Johnston
2014 stated there were no significant differences in the number or
severity of adverse effects for lithium compared to placebo and re-
ported no serious adverse effects. Levin 2004 noted that medica-
tion compliance was low for divalproex, based on blood levels, but
it was not clear whether the low rate of compliance was related to
adverse effects. For gabapentin compared to placebo, Mason 2012
reported no differences between the groups in the type, number
and severity of adverse events reported.
Participants withdrawn due to adverse eﬀects
We found no significant difference between anticonvulsants or
mood stabilisers and placebo in the proportion of participants
withdrawn due to adverse effects (RR 3.67, 95% CI 0.41 to 32.69; 116
participants; 2 studies; I 2 = 43%; Analysis 4.2 ); however, the CIs were
very wide due to the small number of events. In Johnston 2014 , no
participants in either group withdrew due to adverse effects.
Completion of scheduled treatment
We found a significant reduction in treatment completion in par-
ticipants who received anticonvulsants or mood stabilisers com-
pared with those who received placebo (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to
0.92; 141 participants; 3 studies; I 2 = 0%; Analysis 4.3 ). Data on top-
iramate contributed substantially to this result (weight 71.9%) (Mi-
randa 2017 ). Participants who received gabapentin were also less

likely to complete treatment compared to those receiving placebo
(Mason 2012 ).
5. Atypical antidepressant (bupropion)
Two studies examined bupropion compared to placebo (Carpenter
2009; Penetar 2012 ).
Participants abstinent at end of treatment
Neither study reported data on cannabis use outcomes in a form
suitable for inclusion in meta-analysis. Carpenter 2009  reported no
difference between the bupropion and placebo groups in terms of
the severity of dependence rating at the completion of treatment.
Withdrawal symptoms and cravings
In Penetar 2012 , following cessation of cannabis (days eight to 21 of
the scheduled treatment protocol), withdrawal discomfort scores
increased significantly for the placebo group (12 participants) but
not the bupropion group (10 participants) based on change from
baseline. Craving scores also increased more for the placebo group.
Carpenter 2009  did not report data on withdrawal intensity.
Participants experiencing adverse eﬀects
There were no data suitable for inclusion in meta-analyses for the
adverse effects of bupropion. Carpenter 2009  reported that adverse
effects were more likely to be moderate or severe with bupropion
compared to placebo.
Participants withdrawn due to adverse eﬀects
There were no data on withdrawal due to adverse effects.
Completion of scheduled treatment
We found no significant difference between bupropion and placebo
in the proportion of participants completing the scheduled period
of treatment (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.67; 92 participants; 2 studies;
I2 = 0%; Analysis 5.1 ).
6. Anxiolytic (buspirone)
Two studies examined buspirone compared to placebo (McRae-
Clark 2009 ; McRae-Clark 2015; Summary of findings 5 ).
Participants abstinent at end of treatment
Very few participants in McRae-Clark 2015 achieved abstinence,
with no significant difference between the buspirone and place-
bo groups (RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.62 to 6.33; 175 participants; 1 study;
Analysis 6.1 ). However, the results of this study suggested that gen-
der may be a factor in the response to buspirone with women
having worse cannabis use outcomes with buspirone compared to
placebo.
Withdrawal symptoms and cravings
Both studies found buspirone to have no advantage over place-
bo on cannabis withdrawal symptoms (McRae-Clark 2009; McRae-
Clark 2015 ). McRae-Clark 2009 reported no significant difference
between buspirone and placebo in terms of change in the mean
withdrawal checklist score (–10.87, SD 8.99; 23 participants for bus-
pirone and –10.4, SD 7.73; 27 participants for placebo). In McRae-
Clark 2015 , the craving score decreased significantly with time in
treatment, but with no differences between buspirone and place-
bo.Participants experiencing adverse eﬀects
We found that participants were somewhat more likely to experi-
ence adverse effects with buspirone compared to placebo (RR 1.14,
95% CI 1.00 to 1.29; 225 participants; 2 studies; I2 = 0%; Analysis
6.2). In McRae-Clark 2009, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache,
dizziness and drowsiness were the most common adverse effects
reported. Nearly all were noted as being mild to moderate in sever-
ity. In McRae-Clark 2015, 2/88 participants receiving buspirone, and
1/87 participants receiving placebo, experienced moderate-to-se-
vere adverse effects, but these were unrelated to the medication.
Participants withdrawn due to adverse eﬀects
We found no significant difference between buspirone and place-
bo in the proportion of participants withdrawn from treatment due
to adverse effects (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.60; 225 participants; 2
studies; I 2 = 0%; Analysis 6.3 ).
Completion of scheduled treatment
We found no significant difference between buspirone and placebo
in the proportion of participants completing the scheduled period
of treatment (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.23; 225 participants; 2 stud-
ies; I2 = 0%; Analysis 6.4 ).
7. Noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (atomoxetine)
One study compared atomoxetine to placebo in adults with ADHD
(McRae-Clark 2010).
Participants abstinent at end of treatment
The study did not report data on abstinence, but 13/19 partici-
pants receiving atomoxetine and 9/19 participants receiving place-
bo had no days with heavy cannabis use during treatment. The ato-
moxetine group had mean 60.1% (SD 31.5%) days with cannabis
use compared to 68.1% (SD 31.3%) for the placebo group (McRae-
Clark 2010 ). The authors concluded that atomoxetine may have im-
proved some ADHD symptoms but did not reduce cannabis use.
Withdrawal symptoms and cravings
McRae-Clark 2010 reported no significant difference between ato-
moxetine and placebo in terms of change in marijuana craving
score.
Participants experiencing adverse eﬀects
We found no significant difference between atomoxetine and
placebo in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse ef-
fects (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.46; 38 participants; 1 study; Analysis
7.1). McRae-Clark 2010 reported that all adverse effects were mild
to moderate in severity.
Participants withdrawn due to adverse eﬀects
We found no significant difference between atomoxetine and
placebo in the proportion of participants withdrawn from treat-
ment due to adverse effects (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 69.31; 38 par-
ticipants; 1 study; Analysis 7.2 ), but the CI was wide due to the small
number of events.
Completion of scheduled treatment
We found no significant difference between atomoxetine and
placebo in the proportion of participants who completed the

scheduled period of treatment (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.74; 38 par-
ticipants; 1 study; Analysis 7.3 ).
8. Glutamatergic modulator (N-acetylcysteine)
Two studies examined N-acetylcysteine compared to placebo, one
in young people (Gray 2012), and one in adults (Gray 2017) (Sum-
mary of findings 6 ).
Participants abstinent at end of treatment
We found no significant difference between N-acetylcysteine and
placebo in the proportion of participants abstinent at the end of
treatment (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.35; 302 participants; 1 study;
Analysis 8.1 ). On the broader outcome of cannabis use, Gray 2012
found a reduced likelihood of cannabis-positive urine drug tests in
young people treated with N-acetylcysteine, but the subsequent,
larger study with adults did not replicate this finding (Gray 2017).
Withdrawal symptoms and cravings
The studies reported no data on the intensity of withdrawal symp-
toms.
Participants experiencing adverse eﬀects
We found no significant difference between N-acetylcysteine and
placebo in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse ef-
fects (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.23; 418 participants; 2 studies; I2 =
0%; Analysis 8.2 ). Gray 2017 reported that adverse effects were gen-
erally infrequent, with no significant group differences. Of seven se-
rious adverse events reported, six occurred in the placebo group,
and none were deemed to be related to medication.
Participants withdrawn due to adverse eﬀects
We found no significant difference between N-acetylcysteine and
placebo in the proportion of participants withdrawn due to adverse
effects (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.15; 116 participants; 1 study;
Analysis 8.3 ) but the small number of events resulted in a very wide
CI.
Completion of scheduled treatment
We found no significant difference between N-acetylcysteine and
placebo in the proportion of participants completing the scheduled
period of treatment (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21; 418 participants;
2 studies; I 2 = 0%; Analysis 8.4 ).
9. Neuropeptide (oxytocin)
One study of 16 people compared oxytocin and placebo in conjunc-
tion with MET ( Sherman 2017 ).
Participants abstinent at end of treatment
All participants had urine drug screens that were positive for THC at
each visit, with no participants in either group confirmed to be ab-
stinent at end of treatment. On the outcome of cannabis use in gen-
eral, although an overall effect of oxytocin on mean daily cannabis
use was not detected, there was a decrease in cannabis use from
the first to last session of MET in the oxytocin group that was not
found in the placebo group.
Withdrawal symptoms and cravings
The study reported no data on withdrawal symptoms and cravings.Participants experiencing adverse eﬀects
We found no significant difference between oxytocin and placebo
in participants experiencing adverse effects (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.06 to
4.47; 16 participants; 1 study; Analysis 9.2 ).
Participants withdrawn due to adverse eﬀects
The study reported no data on participants withdrawn due to ad-
verse effects.
Completion of scheduled treatment
We found no significant difference between oxytocin and placebo
in the proportion of participants completing the scheduled period
of treatment (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.38; 16 participants; 1 study;
Analysis 9.3 ).

Summary of main results
The medications considered by the studies that met the inclusion
criteria for this review were diverse in nature. This, and the variabil-
ity in the nature of data reported, limited the extent of meta-analy-
sis that was possible, and the strength of conclusions.
The quality of evidence available for assessment of effectiveness
against the defined outcomes was generally very low to moderate
(see Summary of findings for the main comparison; Summary of
findings 2 ; Summary of findings 3 ; Summary of findings 4 ; Summary
of findings 5 ; Summary of findings 6 ). We did not include 'Summa-
ry of findings' tables for bupropion, atomoxetine or oxytocin as da-
ta on these medications were sparse, the studies were largely pre-
liminary in nature and, as such, the findings were of limited clinical
relevance.
This section summarises the main results by medication type. Ad-
ditional information is considered where appropriate from stud-
ies that were excluded from this review so as to form a more com-
plete view of the potential value of medications for the treatment
of cannabis dependence.
1. Preparations containing /uni03949-tetrahydrocannabinol
Preparations containing THC appeared to effectively suppress
cannabis withdrawal symptoms and craving, but THC alone or in
combination with lofexidine was not associated with reductions
in cannabis use or increased rates of completion of treatment in
the time frames of the studies included in this review (see Sum-
mary of findings for the main comparison). Data from one ongo-
ing study of longer-term treatment with nabiximols for cannabis
dependence may change these findings (Bhardwaj 2018 ). The use
of medications such as lofexidine ( Haney 2008) and zolpidem ( Her-
rmann 2016 ) as adjuncts have been proposed to enhance the ef-
fectiveness of THC preparations in attenuating cannabis withdraw-
al and improving sleep, though the first randomised controlled tri-
al of a dronabinol plus lofexidine combination appeared not to im-
prove treatment outcomes ( Levin 2016). It remains possible that ef-
fectiveness may vary with the type of THC preparation.
2. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants
SSRI antidepressants did not appear to affect cannabis use, with-
drawal symptoms or treatment completion (see Summary of find-
ings 2).

3. Mixed action antidepressants
The included studies found that the mixed action antidepressants
nefazodone, mirtazapine and venlafaxine were of little value in the
treatment of cannabis dependence (see Summary of findings 3 ). As
with SSRI antidepressants, the mixed action antidepressants may
be of value in the treatment of depressive symptoms with comor-
bid substance use disorder but appeared to have little value specif-
ically for the treatment of cannabis dependence.
4. Anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers
The quality of evidence for this group of medication was low to very
low (see Summary of findings 4 ). Gabapentin but not divalproex
had some capacity to ameliorate cannabis withdrawal symptoms
and promote reduction in cannabis use compared to placebo. Lithi-
um affected only some cannabis withdrawal symptoms and had no
effect on retention in treatment. Topiramate may have had some
promise in reducing cannabis use, though its poor tolerability may
limit its clinical usefulness. Overall, the negative effect on treat-
ment retention with anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers may lim-
it their clinical utility.
5. Atypical antidepressant (bupropion)
The included studies indicated that bupropion may have had some
effect on cannabis withdrawal symptoms, but the data were incon-
clusive on other outcomes. A 'Summary of findings' table was not
prepared because of the data limitations.
6. Anxiolytic (buspirone)
Buspirone had little value in the treatment of cannabis dependence
(see Summary of findings 5 ). However, it may be useful for the treat-
ment of anxiety in cannabis users.
7. Noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (atomoxetine)
Atomoxetine is used for the treatment of ADHD and the included
study investigated the effectiveness of atomoxetine in a population
of cannabis users with ADHD. This study found atomoxetine to have
little value in the treatment of cannabis dependence, but it may still
be useful for the treatment of ADHD in cannabis users. A 'Summary
of findings' table was not prepared because of the data limitations.
8. Glutamatergic modulator (N-acetylcysteine)
This dietary supplement may have had some effectiveness in the
treatment of cannabis dependence but available data were not
conclusive (see Summary of findings 6 ).
9. Neuropeptide (oxytocin)
Results from one small pilot study suggested oxytocin may be of in-
terest to study in further trials, though the results of the pilot study
were not conclusive. A 'Summary of findings' table was not pre-
pared because of the data limitations.
Overall completeness and applicability of evidence
Most studies conducted were small, the majority of participants
were men, and most conducted in the US, Canada and Australia.
All of these factors may potentially limit the generalisability of the
data. Studies have considered both adult and adolescent popula-
tions, although there were differing results in the case of N-acetyl-
cysteine. As many studies were smaller pilot studies with short time
frames, larger studies with longer-term follow-up are still required.Greater harmonisation in measures used in different studies to cap-
ture changes in cannabis use (in addition to abstinence at end of
treatment) may assist in understanding the potential role for dif-
ferent medications, as abstinence is just one aspect of substance
use, and increasingly other measures of reduced substance use are
being considered for medication trials in substance use disorders
(McCann 2015 ).
Quality of the evidence
The studies included in this review were mostly small, the quality
of evidence was assessed as generally very low to moderate (see
Summary of findings for the main comparison; Summary of find-
ings 2; Summary of findings 3 ; Summary of findings 4 ; Summary of
findings 5 ; Summary of findings 6 ) and the capacity for meta-analy-
sis was limited. As a result, the conclusions of this review should
be considered tentative at best. Nonetheless, the review provides
an overview of the current status of evidence and points to future
directions for research on the development of pharmacotherapies
for cannabis dependence.
Potential biases in the review process
Pharmacological approaches to the management of cannabis with-
drawal are still in an experimental phase with a diverse array of
medications being explored, many of which have shown limited ef-
fectiveness. Studies with negative or neutral findings are less like-
ly to be published and we identified two studies with only limited
information available ( Frewen 2007; Johnston 2014 ). It is possible
that there are further such studies that we did not locate.
Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews
We have identified eight reviews of treatments for cannabis de-
pendence ( Benyamina 2008 ; Copeland 2014 ; Danovitch 2012; Gore-
lick 2016 ; Nordstrom 2007 ; Sherman 2016 ; Vandrey 2009 ; Walther
2016). All are in agreement that several pharmacotherapies, in
particular preparations of THC and gabapentin show promise for
the treatment of cannabis dependence; but there is currently in-
sufficient evidence to support their broad therapeutic use. These
reviews also identify psychotherapies, such as MET and cogni-
tive-behavioural therapy, as having demonstrated efficacy in de-
creasing cannabis use and cannabis-related consequences. Hence,
these reviews support the conclusion that psychological approach-
es should continue to be the mainstay of treatment for cannabis
use disorders, with pharmacotherapies continuing to be experi-
mental.

Implications for practice
Studies undertaken to date on pharmacotherapies for cannabis
dependence are insufficient to guide clinical practice. There is in-
complete evidence for all of the pharmacotherapies investigated
in this review. Quantitative analysis was not possible for most of
the outcomes and was limited for most of the pharmacotherapies
investigated. The quality of evidence for many of the outcomes
was low or very low due to small sample size, inconsistency and
risk of attrition bias. The quantitative analyses that were possi-
ble, in combination with the general findings reported by the stud-
ies reviewed, indicate that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
(SSRI) antidepressants, mixed action antidepressants, atypical an-

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
tidepressants (bupropion), anxiolytics (buspirone) and noradrena-
line reuptake inhibitors (atomoxetine) are probably of little value
in the treatment of cannabis dependence. THC may be of poten-
tial value based on qualitative data from individual studies, though
meta-analyses found no significant effect on treatment outcomes,
and THC preparations should be considered to still be experimen-
tal. The evidence base for THC, the anticonvulsant gabapentin, the
glutamatergic modulator N-acetylcysteine and oxytocin is weak
and at this time it is not possible to quantitatively estimate their ef-
fectiveness.
At this point in time, psychological approaches such as MET and
cognitive-behavioural therapy remain the mainstay of treatment
for cannabis use disorders (Gates 2016).
Implications for research
There is sufficient evidence to indicate that preparations contain-
ing THC and gabapentin may have therapeutic potential, and fur-ther research is warranted. N-acetylcysteine and oxytocin are al-
so worth further consideration to provide alternative medication
approaches, but SSRI and mixed action antidepressants, the atyp-
ical antidepressant bupropion, the anxiolytic buspirone, anticon-
vulsants and mood stabilisers, and the selective noradrenaline re-
uptake inhibitor atomoxetine appear to be of limited value in the
treatment of cannabis dependence other than for the manage-
ment of relevant concomitant conditions. Given that psychological
approaches are currently the mainstay of treatment for cannabis
use disorders, research into interactions of pharmacotherapies and
psychological approaches would also be of value. Oxytocin in par-
ticular may enhance psychological therapies through the promo-
tion of prosocial behaviours ( Sherman 2017 ).

Riboflavin added to medication to monitor adherence
All participants received placebo for 2 weeks after medication phase
Participants attended treatment clinic twice weekly (paid USD 5 for transport costs at each visit); med-
ications dispensed weekly
Weekly individual psychosocial intervention based on coping skills as adjunct therapy
Outcomes Number completing 13 weeks of study, number abstinent at week 10, dependence severity at baseline
and week 10 (and improvement), withdrawal symptoms, sleep, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale at base-
line and week 10
Total adverse effects during study.
Cannabis use assessed by self-report and urine toxicology of observed samples provided at each clinic
visit, with a cut-oﬀ of 100 ng/mL (rather than usual 50 ng/mL) to minimise false positives.
Severity of dependence symptoms assessed by Clinical Global Impression (scores from 1 = no patholo-
gy to 7 = extreme pathology)
Sleep quality self-reported once a week using the St Mary's Hospital Sleep Questionnaire
Irritability self-reported every other week with the Snaith Irritability Scale (4 items each rated 0 to 3)
Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (14 items each rated 0 to 4) administered by clinician every other week
If either urine or self-report data were missing for a given week, it was considered a non-abstinent
week.

Risk of bias
Bias Authors' judgement Support for judgement
Random sequence genera-
tion (selection bias)Unclear risk Method of sequence generation not reported
Allocation concealment
(selection bias)Low riskQuote: ""A research pharmacist who was independent of the research team,
conducted the randomisation."" ""All capsules were prepared at the research
pharmacy and looked identical for all three treatment conditions.""
Comment: methods for allocation concealment not reported but the involve-
ment of an independent pharmacist would be expected to protect against
bias.
Blinding of participants
and personnel (perfor-
mance bias) 
All outcomesLow riskQuote: ""All capsules were prepared at the research pharmacy and looked iden-
tical for all three treatment conditions.""
Comment: study stated to have been conducted double-blind. The provi-
sion of active and placebo medications in identical capsules and the use of
riboflavin to confirm medication adherence would help to reduce the risk of
bias.
Blinding of outcome as-
sessment (detection bias) 
All outcomesLow riskStudy conducted double-blind, as indicated above, and the use of urine
screening to support self-report data would be expected to be associated with
a low risk of bias.Carpenter 2009/uni00A0/uni00A0(Continued)

(or day) of admission; hospital or clinic record number; alterna-
tion; judgement of the clinician; results of a laboratory test or a se-

High riskInvestigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assign-
ments because 1 of the following method was used: open random
allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment
envelopes without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were
unsealed or nonopaque or not sequentially numbered); alterna-
tion or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other ex-
plicitly unconcealed procedure.2. Allocation concealment (selection bias)

The protocol focused on the management of cannabis withdrawal. When it became clear that very few studies considered withdrawal as
a distinct phase, the review was broadened to include interventions to support cessation or reduction of cannabis use as well as manage-
ment of withdrawal symptoms. The broadening of the review made the specification of ""the portion of the scheduled treatment episode
that is completed on average"" less relevant; hence this was dropped from the review.
The protocol stipulated the inclusion of studies that involve participants who are diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) or 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health
Problems (ICD-10) criteria as cannabis dependent, or where dependence is likely based on reported dose, duration and frequency of use
(daily or multiple days per week). Given the qualifier of ""where dependence is likely"" the specification of DSM-IV or ICD-10 criteria would
not have resulted in the exclusion of any included studies and was dropped from the methods of the review in the interests of simplicity.
The approach to heterogeneity specified in the protocol (use of a random-effects model in the presence of statistical heterogeneity) was
changed based on statistical advice received in the interim. The routine use of a random-effects model is preferred and was the approach
used for the review.
This version of the review specifically excluded studies involving participants with diagnosed schizophrenia and cannabis use disorder.
The primary therapeutic goal in these studies was management of psychotic symptoms, with consideration of the effect of different an-
tipsychotic medications on cannabis use.

Objective aaTo investigate the impact of regular cannabis use on long-term remission of mood symptoms in bipolar spectrum disorders.
Methods aaThe 24-month prospective observational study included patients (n=239) with bipolar I disorder and schizoaffective disor -
der, bipolar type. Participants were classified as regular cannabis users (three times or more per week) or non-users. The primary out -
come measure was the achievement of remission on the evaluations during the 24 months.
Results aaOf the 234 participants for whom data was available, 25 (10.7%) were regular cannabis users, and the group comprised signif -
icantly more males than females. In the total population, cannabis use was significantly associated with decreased likelihood of remis -
sion during the 24-month follow-up period. Subgroup analyses showed that cannabis use was significantly associated with lower remis -
sion rates on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale in females (n=139) and patients prescribed mood stabilizers alone (n=151), whereas 
in males (n=95) and patients prescribed olanzapine and/or a mood stabilizer (n=83), cannabis use was significantly associated with low -
er remission rates on the Y oung Mania Rating Scale. Remission rates were lowest in the concurrent cannabis and tobacco smoking group 
(n=22) followed by the tobacco smoking only group (n=97), and the non-smoker group (n=116). The post-hoc analysis revealed that all 
remission rates were significantly lower in the concurrent cannabis and the tobacco smoking group compared to the non-smoker group.
Conclusion aaCannabis use negatively affects the long-term clinical outcome in patients with bipolar spectrum disorders. A compre -
hensive assessment and integrated management of cannabis use are required to achieve better treatment outcomes for bipolar spectrum 
disorders. Psychiatry Investig 2015 ;12(3):349-355

Cannabis use is common in psychiatric populations;1,2 it is 
a well-documented risk factor for schizophrenia and is asso -
ciated with a poor prognosis for the condition.3-6 Cannabis is 
one of the most commonly abused drugs among patients with bipolar disorder.1,7,8 Several cross-sectional studies of patients 
with bipolar disorder have shown that cannabis use is associ -
ated with an earlier age of onset, severe mood symptoms, 
greater disability, and a higher suicide risk compared with 
non-users.2,6,9-12 A few prospective studies have revealed that 
cannabis users exhibit poor adherence to treatment and have 
higher levels of overall illness severity, mania, and psychosis 
than do non-users.13-15 However, the effect of cannabis on the 
long-term clinical course of patients with bipolar spectrum 
disorders have been relatively less studied, whereas several 
prospective studies have examined the effects of alcohol use 
disorders and tobacco smoking on the course of bipolar ill -
ness.16-18
Previous studies of bipolar disorder have found that canna -
bis use is more frequent in males than in females.8,19,20 More - 350  Psychiatry Investig 2015 ;12(3):349-355Cannabis Use in Bipolar Spectrum Disorder
over, gender differences in illness characteristics and course 
have been widely documented in psychiatric illnesses includ -
ing bipolar disorder.2,20-22 However, to our knowledge, no 
study of the effect of cannabis use on long-term clinical out -
comes has investigated gender differences. 
Our 24-month prospective study investigated the impact of 
cannabis use on the clinical course of patients with bipolar 
spectrum disorders with a focus on long-term remission of 
mood symptoms according to gender and type of medication. 
The present study analyzed data from the Bipolar Compre -
hensive Outcomes Study (BCOS),23 a 2-year, prospective, nat -
uralistic observational study designed to improve under -
standing of the treatment and outcomes of patients diagnosed 
with bipolar I disorder or schizoaffective disorder. 
METHODS
Study design and participants
The rationale and design of the BCOS have been detailed 
previously.23,24 Briefly, participants were enrolled in the study 
if they met the diagnostic criteria for bipolar I disorder or 
schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, were aged 18 years or 
older, and were willing and able to comply with the study re -
quirements. To obtain a representative sample of participants, 
the exclusion criteria were minimal. Participants could com -
mence participation in the study at any phase of their illness. 
As this was an observational study, participants were not ran -
domised to treatment groups but instead received their usual 
care, which could be varied by their treating clinician. At base -
line, participants had to be receiving at least one of several 
conventional mood stabilizers (lithium carbonate, sodium 
valproate, or carbamazepine), olanzapine as a mood stabilizer, 
or a combination of a conventional mood stabilizer plus olan -
zapine. All treatment decisions were made by the participant’s 
primary treating clinicians, independent of the study. Partici -
pants were recruited from October 2003 to May 2008 from 
Australian public hospitals and private clinics. Trained evalu -
ators assessed participants on nine separate occasions: at 
study entry and every 3 months up to 24 months. All partici -
pants provided informed consent to participate in the study, 
which was conducted in accordance with Australian ethics 
and the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 and approved by the 
relevant ethics committees.
Procedures and measures
Diagnoses were confirmed by the Mini-International Neu -
ropsychiatric Interview (MINI) version 5, a semi-structured 
interview designed to identify major Axis I psychiatric disor -
ders including alcohol dependence and abuse.25 Suicide risk 
in the past month was also measured by six questions during the MINI interview. High suicide risk was defined by scores 
on the relevant questions on the MINI interview. 
The primary outcome measure of this study was the rate of 
achieving remission over the nine evaluation points (number 
of remissions/9) during the 24 months. Missing data resulting 
from non-visits were operationally defined as indicative of 
non-remission. Symptomatic remission was defined as a 
Y oung Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)26 total score of ≤1227 or a 
21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-21)28 to-
tal score of ≤8.29,30 Total remission was defined as remission of 
both YMRS and HAMD-21 scores. 
Our key independent variable was cannabis use. Partici -
pants were questioned about cannabis use at visit 1 using the 
Habits form.31 Frequency of cannabis use during the past 3 
months was investigated. Participants who reported regular 
cannabis use 3 or more days per week were classified as can -
nabis users, which was consistent with previous studies.32,33 
The remaining participants were classified as cannabis non-
users. In terms of tobacco smoking, the BCOS study classified 
participants as those who smoked tobacco daily and those 
who did not.
Statistical analysis
Sociodemographic and clinical variables of the cannabis 
user and non-user groups were compared using independent 
chi-squared tests, t-tests, or Mann-Whitney U-tests as appro -
priate. The effect of cannabis use on total, 21-item Hamilton 
Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-21), and the Y oung Mania 
Rating Scale (YMRS) remission rates during the 24-month 
follow-up period were compared using the Mann-Whitney 
U-test. Additionally, comparisons were made across gender 
and medication type. Spearman’s correlation test was used to 
assess the relationship between age and remission rates. In or -
der to explore the effect of tobacco smoking on remission 
rate, the participants were divided into three subgroups: con -
current cannabis and tobacco smoking, tobacco smoking 
only, and non-smoking. Remission rates among the three 
groups were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test and post 
hoc paired comparisons were conducted using the Mann-
Whitney U-test with the Bonferroni correction. Statistical sig -
nificance was defined as p-values of ≤0.05. All statistical tests 
were two tailed. 
RESULTS
A total of 239 participants were enrolled in the BCOS 
study. We were unable to obtain information on cannabis use 
from 5 of the 239 participants. Of the 234 participants whose 
data were analyzed, 213 (91.0%) completed the 24-month 
study. The mean age of participants was 41.8 ±12.7 years and  SW Kim et al. 
   www.psychiatryinvestigation.org   35159.4% were female. A total of 172 participants were diagnosed 
with bipolar I disorder and 62 were diagnosed with schizoaf -
fective disorder, bipolar type. 
Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were com -
pared according to cannabis use (Table 1). A total of 25 (10.7%) 
subjects regularly used cannabis. The mean age of cannabis 
users was significantly lower than that of non-users. Signifi -
cantly more males than females were cannabis users. The per -
centage of daily tobacco smokers was significantly higher 
among cannabis users than among non-users; only 3 (12.0%) 
regular cannabis users did not smoke daily. Baseline YMRS 
scores were significantly higher in cannabis users than in 
non-users. Baseline HAMD-21 scores tended to be higher 
among cannabis users than non-users; however, the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.051). There was a non-
significant trend for cannabis users to be at higher risk of sui -
cide than non-users at baseline (p=0.069). No significant dif -
ference of concurrent alcohol dependence and alcohol abuse 
existed between cannabis users and non-users.

The analysis of remission rates in cannabis users and non-
users across gender and medication type revealed that canna -
bis use was significantly associated with lower total remission 
and HAMD-21 remission rates in females (n=139), whereas 
it was significantly associated with lower YMRS, but not 
HAMD-21, remission rates in males (n=95). Cannabis use 
was significantly associated with lower total remission and 
HAMD-21 remission rates among patients who were pre -
scribed mood stabilizers alone (n=151); however, cannabis 
use was significantly associated with lower YMRS remission 
rates in patients who took olanzapine and/or mood stabilizers 
(n=83). 
Figure 1 shows total, HAMD-21, and YMRS remission 
rates among the concurrent cannabis and tobacco smoking 
group (n=22), tobacco smoking only (n=97), and non-smok -
er groups (n=116) during the 24-month follow-up period. All 
remission rates (total, HAMD-21, and YMRS) were signifi -
cantly different among the three groups (p=0.011, 0.016, and 
0.012, respectively). The remission rates were lowest in the 
concurrent cannabis and tobacco smoking group and the 
non-smoker group had the highest remission rates. The post 
hoc analysis revealed that all remission rates (total, HAMD-
21, and YMRS) were significantly lower in the concurrent 
cannabis and tobacco-smoking group compared to the non-
smoker group (p=0.008, 0.012, and 0.009, respectively). The 
remission rates in the tobacco smoking only group were 
higher than in the non-smoker group (p=0.048–0.050), but 
the difference did not reach statistical significance after the 
Bonferroni correction (p=0.0169). The remission rates were 
not significantly different between the tobacco only and con -
current cannabis and tobacco groups (all p>0.08).DISCUSSION
Our findings show that cannabis use is associated with de -
creased likelihood of long-term remission in bipolar spectrum 
disorders. In particular, we observed interaction effects of can -
nabis use and mood symptoms on gender and medication 
type. That is, cannabis use was associated with lower remis -
sion rates for depressive symptoms in females and for manic 
symptoms in males. Moreover, remission rates for depressive 
symptoms were lower in cannabis users prescribed mood sta -
bilizers alone, whereas remission rates for manic symptoms 
were lower in cannabis users prescribed olanzapine. To our 
knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate differing ef -
fects of cannabis use on polarity specific long-term remission 
rates (24-month period) according to gender and type of 
medication in patients with bipolar spectrum disorders. 
A few studies have demonstrated an association between 
cannabis use and severe manic symptoms, but not depression, 
in patients with bipolar disorder.13,14 Furthermore, cannabis 
use has been shown to increase the risk of manic symptoms 
in the general population.34 However, a recent study showed 
that the association between cannabis use and mood symp -
toms is complex and more strongly correlated with depres -
sion than mania.35 Our results revealed interactions of depres -
sive and manic symptom remission rates on gender and type 
of medication.
Our finding of an association between cannabis use and 
lower remission rates for depressive symptoms in females 
supports a previous study showing that cannabis use in teen -
age girls, but not boys, predicted high rates of depression.36 
Moreover, cumulative evidence suggests that cannabis use in -
creases the risk for unipolar depression.37,38 This association 
may be linked to the greater vulnerability of women to devel -
oping depression.36,39 Childhood sexual abuse, which is wide -
spread among female cannabis users with bipolar disorder,12 
is associated with poor outcomes for depression and should 
be considered a contributing factor to the effect of cannabis 
use on clinical outcome.40,41 Similarly, abuse is linked to the 
development of maladaptive cognitive schemas and extreme 
attributions, which too are risks for poorer outcomes.42,43
Cannabis may diminish the effect of medications used to 
treat bipolar spectrum disorders. Our results showed that 
olanzapine was associated with lower remission rates for 
manic symptoms in patients with bipolar spectrum disorder 
who were cannabis users. Investigations into the effect of can -
nabis on the inhibition and induction of human liver cyto -
chrome P450 (CYP450) isoforms generally reflect a low risk 
of clinically significant drug interactions with most use, al -
though in vivo  studies in humans have not been conduct -
ed.44,45 However, smoked cannabis and tobacco induce hepatic Cannabis & tobacco Tobacco only Non-smoker100

1A2 substrates, such as olanzapine, may be decreased in indi -
viduals who smoke cannabis.44-47 Furthermore, poor adher -
ence to medications, which is common among cannabis users 
in bipolar populations, may contribute to unfavorable out -
comes.15,48-50
A high rate of co-use of cannabis with tobacco smoking 
and alcohol use has been observed in patients with bipolar 
and other psychiatric disorders.2,15,16,32,51,52 A recent study 
found that co-occurring cannabis use disorder and nicotine 
dependence was associated with a higher prevalence of bipo -
lar disorder compared with cannabis use disorder alone.53 In 
our study, alcohol dependence and abuse were not associated 
with cannabis use. However, cannabis use was highly associ -
ated with tobacco smoking. Previous studies, including the 
BCOS, have found that tobacco smoking is associated with 
poor mental health outcomes among patients with bipolar 
spectrum disorder.17,18,54 Our results revealed a tendency for 
lower remission rates in tobacco only smokers compared with 
non-smokers. Furthermore, our findings suggest that concur -
rent cannabis and tobacco smoking has a cumulative effect on 
unfavorable outcomes in patients with bipolar spectrum dis -
orders. Ideally, a comparison of cannabis users who did and 
did not smoke tobacco would help differentiate the effects of 
tobacco and cannabis smoking on remission rates. However, 
the number of cannabis users in our study population who 
did not smoke tobacco (n=3) was too small to perform a sta -
tistical analysis. Further studies that include subjects who 
smoke cannabis but not tobacco are warranted.
Substance use disorders including cannabis use often go 
unrecognized or are viewed as a secondary problem in psy -
chiatric treatment settings.55 However, our results, showing a 
negative impact of cannabis use on the clinical course of pa -
tients with bipolar spectrum disorders, highlight the need to 
actively assess and manage cannabis use problems. A compre -
hensive evaluation of patients with bipolar disorders (particu -
larly males) should include a systematic assessment of sub -
stance use problems including cannabis use.2 Furthermore, 
specialized treatment approaches should be available for this 
vulnerable population including motivational interview and 
cognitive behavioral therapy for co-occurring bipolar and 
cannabis use.55 Further study is required to investigate the im -
pact of effective management of cannabis use on the clinical 
course of patients with bipolar spectrum disorders. In addi -
tion, the biological substrates associated with comorbid can -
nabis use in bipolar spectrum disorders should be investigat -
ed to clarify the mechanisms underlying the negative impact 
and to develop effective and safe treatment strategies.
Our study has several limitations that should be considered 
when interpreting our results. First, cannabis use was investi -gated only cross-sectionally and there was no longitudinal 
evaluation. Regular checks on cannabis use in patients with 
bipolar spectrum disorders would provide more information 
about longitudinal outcomes. In addition, the investigation of 
the relative sequence of cannabis use onset and bipolar disor -
der onset would provide a deeper understanding of the com -
plex associations between these two conditions. Second, the 
potential impact of concomitant psychosocial therapies on 
the outcomes was not evaluated in this study. Third, HAMD-
21 and YMRS scores were used to evaluate symptoms in the 
week prior to the assessment visit. Given the fluctuating 
course of symptoms, this timing may not adequately reflect 
the symptoms across the 3-month interval between visits. 
However, the 2-year prospective observation period provided 
an extended period of observation that enabled examination 
of the fluctuating course of illnesses and outcomes. Finally, 
our sample and setting might have resulted in selection bias 
and unmeasured confounding variables. In addition, the 
quality of treatment was not controlled strictly in this study. 
However, our prospective, pragmatic study design, high 2-year 
retention rate, and inclusion of patients at all levels of symp -
tom severity and treatment allows for broad generalizability.30
In conclusion, regular cannabis use has a negative effect on 
the clinical course of bipolar spectrum disorders. Individuals 
with bipolar spectrum disorders who are regular cannabis us -
ers are a vulnerable population.9 Given the clinical significance 
of cannabis use in bipolar spectrum disorders, routine com -
prehensive and regular assessments of cannabis use are rec -
ommended. Furthermore, special attention to, and manage -
ment of, patients with these substance problems must be 
integrated into the treatment strategy to achieve better thera -
peutic outcomes for bipolar spectrum disorders.

Determine the prevalence of drug use ininjured drivers and identify associated demographicfactors and crash characteristics.
Design: Prospective cross-sectional study.
Setting: Seven trauma centres in British Columbia,Canada (2010–2012).
Participants: Automobile drivers who had bloodobtained within 6 h of a crash.
Main outcome measures: We analysed blood forcannabis, alcohol and other impairing drugs usingliquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LCMS).
Results: 1097 drivers met inclusion criteria. 60%were aged 20–50 years, 63.2% were male and 29.0%were admitted to hospital. We found alcohol in 17.8%(15.6% to 20.1%) of drivers. Cannabis was the secondmost common recreational drug: cannabis metaboliteswere present in 12.6% (10.7% to 14.7%) of driversand we detectedΔ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ-9-THC) in 7.3% (5.9% to 9.0%), indicating recent use. Malesand drivers aged under 30 years were most likely touse cannabis. We detected cocaine in 2.8% (2.0% to4.0%) of drivers and amphetamines in 1.2% (0.7% to2.0%). We also found medications includingbenzodiazepines (4.0% (2.9% to 5.3%)),antidepressants (6.5% (5.2% to 8.1%)) anddiphenhydramine (4.7% (3.5% to 6.2%)). Drivers agedover 50 years and those requiring hospital admissionwere most likely to have used medications. Overall,40.1% (37.2% to 43.0%) of drivers tested positive foralcohol or at least one impairing drug and 12.7%(10.7% to 14.7%) tested positive for more than onesubstance.
Conclusions: Alcohol, cannabis and a broad range ofother impairing drugs are commonly detected ininjured drivers. Alcohol is well known to causecrashes, but further research is needed to determinethe impact of other drug use, including drug –alcohol and drug–drug combinations, on crash risk. Inparticular, more work is needed to understand the roleof medications in causing crashes to guide drivereducation programmes and improve public safety.
BACKGROUNDMotor vehicle crashes (MVCs) due toimpaired driving are a leading cause ofpreventable injury and death. Alcohol isinvolved in approximately one-third ofserious MVCs resulting in severe injury ordeath. Many illicit drugs such as cannabis,over-the-counter medications such as antihis-tamines and prescription medications suchas benzodiazepines also impair the psycho-motor skills required for safe driving.
1–11Strengths and limitations of this study
▪We analysed blood samples for the presence ofactive drugs. This allowed us to determine theprevalence of recent drug use in injured drivers.Most previous North American studies wereunable to distinguish between drivers with posi-tive metabolites and those with active drug intheir blood.▪Rather than reporting the results of drug testsperformed for clinical purposes (ie, based onclinical suspicion of drug use), we analysedexcess blood that had been obtained for otherclinical purposes (ie, not for drug screening). Inthis way, we avoided the risk of selecting onlydrivers suspected of using drugs.▪This study had research ethics board approvalfor waiver of consent because we used excessblood that had been obtained for clinical use andwas going to be discarded, and because of theprocedures we put in place making it impossibleto link toxicology results back to an individualdriver. The advantage of this is that we avoid theselection bias that could occur if drivers whoused drugs were more likely to refuse toparticipate.▪First, the excess blood volumes are small whichlimited analysis in some cases. In particular, wedid not always have sufficient blood to performquantification of drugs (other than cannabi-noids). However, the analytic process is suffi-cient for the purpose of detecting presenceversus absence of all drugs.▪Second, we obtained blood from only thosedrivers who had serious enough injuries thatthey required blood analysis as part of routinecare. This means that drivers with minor injurieswere not included and our findings do not applyto drivers with less severe injuries.
Brubacher JR,et al.BMJ Open2016;6:e009278. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2015-009278 1Open Access Researchgroup.bmj.com on July 31, 2017 - Published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/Downloaded from  Compared with drunk driving, drug driving remainspoorly understood.Testing drivers for drugs other than alcohol is technic-ally and logistically challenging. Drug testing at the road-side is limited because available portable devices requiretraining in their use and interpretation of results, andthese devices detect classes of commonly abused drugsbut not the full range of drugs that may affect driving.To get a complete picture, detection and measurementof all the relevant drugs in blood requires analysis by atoxicology lab, which involves time and expense as wellas sophisticated instruments operated by highly quali ﬁed staff. In addition, unlike alcohol which can be measuredeasily with a breathalyser, other drugs must be analysedin bodilyﬂuids such as urine, saliva or blood. Urine ana-lysis usually measures inactive metabolites that remainpresent for days after last use in the case of cocaine andfor weeks in heavy cannabis users. Therefore, urinetesting identiﬁes drug users but does not provide evi-dence of impairment or recent drug use. Oralﬂuid tests can also be used to detect recent drug use but do notyet provide the same diagnostic accuracy as bloodtesting.
12
Blood samples provide the best measure of drug con-centration levels, but cut-offs to assess whether indivi-duals are impaired have not been agreed upon amongscientists. For cannabis,Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol(Δ-9-THC) cut-off levels in whole blood for determiningimpairment have been suggested by Grotenhermenet al,
13at 6–8 ng/mL and 2–5 ng/mL by Hartman andHuestis.
14A metabolite (tetrahydrocannabinol car-boxylic acid; THC-COOH) is sometimes used to assesspast exposure to cannabis, but its presence is unrelatedto performance deﬁcits. In most cases,Δ-9-THC >0 inwhole blood indicates recent use of cannabis (ie, withinthe previous 4 h), although some heavy cannabis usersmay have positiveΔ-9-THC levels that persist fordays.
15 16Very low bloodΔ-9-THC levels (ie, <2 ng/mL)likely have little relationship to driving performance.Drug driving laws vary from country to country. In manycountries, including Canada and the Netherlands, drugdriving law is based on evidence of impairment and noton per se drug levels. Some jurisdictions, such asAustralia, Germany and several states in the USA, have azero tolerance policy towards driving after using illicitdrugs, making it illegal to drive with any detectable levelof these drugs in bodyﬂuids. Norway is theﬁrst countryto institute non-zero per se limits for drug driving.
17
The prevalence of drug driving is most commonlydetermined in either (1) roadside surveys of driversselected from the general driving population, (2) instudies of injured drivers after a crash or (3) in coroner’ s studies of fatally injured drivers. The major limitation oftypical roadside surveys is the high refusal rate which isapproximately 20% in recent North American surveys.
18
Coroners often test fatally injured drivers for alcoholand other drugs, so coroner’s data provide an opportun-ity to estimate the prevalence of drug driving.Unfortunately, coroner’s data may be subject to selectionbias if testing is done based on suspicion of drug userather than routinely in all drivers. In addition, somecoroner’s services measure and report the presence ofinactive metabolites (ie, from urine testing) rather thantesting blood samples for the presence of active parentcompound. Aﬁnal limitation of coroner’s data is thatthe prevalence of drug use in fatally injured drivers maydiffer from that in less severely injured drivers.Another important population to study is injureddrivers treated in hospital. The prevalence of drug usein injured drivers has been studied in several Europeancountries as part of the Driving Under the Inﬂuence of Drugs (DRUID) project,19–21as well as in Australia22and Hong Kong.
23North American studies of the prevalenceof drug use in injured drivers have been conducted inToronto (1993),
24Colorado (2001),25Chicago (1994)26
and Baltimore (2005).27A recent study from Halifaxand Toronto (2014) reported the prevalence of recentalcohol or cannabis use in injured drivers but did notreport the prevalence of other drugs.
28Most priorNorth American studies determined drug exposure bymeasuring the presence of common drug metabolites inurine samples and therefore do not provide accurateestimates of recent drug use. Furthermore, the informa-tion is dated. The current study is part of an ongoingproject investigating the role of cannabis in MVCs. Theaim of the current paper is to determine the prevalenceof drug use in injured drivers treated in BritishColumbia (BC) trauma centres. Secondarily, we reportthe identity of the drugs that are detected and thedemographic characteristics of the drivers with positivedrug tests.MethodsThis study was approved by the University of BritishColumbia Clinical Research Ethics Board and by theresearch ethics boards of the Vancouver Coastal Health,Fraser Health, Interior Health, Northern Health andVancouver Island Health Authority. Permission wasgranted to waive consent because of the careful proce-dures developed to protect personal information. In par-ticular, our data handling process ensured that noindividual driver could be linked to his/her toxicologyresults.Drivers treated in the emergency departments (EDs)at seven participating BC trauma centres between 2010and 2012 were identiﬁed prospectively. All injured auto-mobile drivers who had blood obtained within 6 h ofthe crash were eligible. The decision to obtain bloodsamples was made by the treating physician. In general,blood was obtained when there was a possibility ofserious injury based on history (eg, high-speed crash orside impact collision) and/or physical examination (eg,abnormal vital signs or other clinical evidence of poten-tial serious injury). Note that clinicians did not receivethe results of drug testing from this study and suspicionof drug use was not a criterion for obtaining blood

If drug testing was indicated clinically, it wouldbe done on urine samples in the hospital laboratoryand not as part of this study. Drivers were excluded ifblood samples were not obtained within 6 h after thecrash, no excess blood remained after clinical use or ifthey were drivers of a motorcycle or commercial vehicle.Drivers were identiﬁed using methods that bestﬁt with the workﬂow at participating hospitals. At the largesthospital, injured drivers areﬂagged electronically onregistration and research assistants identiﬁed injureddrivers through daily review of an electronic report.Tracking of included and excluded drivers at this sitewas done using electronicﬂags. At other centres, chartsof injured drivers who had blood testing done wereﬂagged by clinical staff. We were unable to review all EDcharts at these sites over the course of the study, but wecompleted a 1-month comprehensive review of all EDcharts at these sites to estimate the numbers of excludeddrivers (ﬁgure 1).In all centres, once injured drivers were identiﬁed, research assistants reviewed health records (paramedicand ED records) and identiﬁed those who had blood-work obtained within 6 h of the crash. For these drivers,research assistants went to the hospital laboratory andobtained excess blood if any remained after use for clin-ical care. This usually occurred between 24 and 48 hfrom time of blood draw. Blood was relabelled with astudy ID replacing patient name, frozen and transportedto the British Columbia Provincial Toxicology Centre forlater analysis.In participating hospitals, blood samples from injureddrivers are usually analysed for alcohol by enzymatictesting using alcohol dehydrogenase as part of routinetrauma care. If alcohol levels were not measured for clin-ical purposes, they were measured at the ProvincialToxicology Centre using gas chromatography-ﬂame ion- ization detection with a detection limit of 0.01% as partof this study. In addition to measuring alcohol, we per-formed a broad-spectrum drug screen on each patient ’s blood by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry(LCMS). The extraction process recovers acidic and basicdrugs and is able to detect illicit drugs and their metabo-lites (cannabinoids, cocaine, amphetamines includingdesigner drugs, opiates) as well as psychotropic pharma-ceuticals (including antihistamines, benzodiazepines,other hypnotics and sedating antidepressants). Thedetection limits was 0.2 ng/mL forΔ-9-THC and 1 ng/mL for most other substances. When blood tested posi-tive for cannabinoids, we quantiﬁed the active ingredient(Δ-9-THC) and the inactive metabolite (THC-COOH). Ifenough blood was available, the levels of other drugs thattested positive were quantiﬁed. In most cases, samplesconsisted of whole blood. In a small number of cases(n=39), only plasma specimens were obtained. In thiscase, plasma results were adjusted to equivalent wholeblood results according to international standards.

Health records including ambulance records ofinjured drivers were reviewed and basic demographicand medical information was recorded. We recorded allmedications given as part of clinical care, either inambulance or in the ED, prior to blood draw. These‘post-crash’medications were accounted for whenreporting the medications detected in driver bloodsamples.For all drugs suspected of impairing driving ability, wereport the percentage of drivers who test positive accord-ing to age, gender and time of day. We also report thepercentage of drivers who had drug levels above theNorwegian legal limit.
17We report unadjusted ORs with95% CIs and useχ
2tests to compare the prevalence ofdrug use among drivers of different ages, genders andcrash characteristics.RESULTSDuring the study period, 1097 drivers met study criteriaand had blood analysed for drugs. The majority ofdrivers in our samples were between the ages of 20 and49 years, and 63.3% were male. Most (73.0%) driverswere brought to hospital by ambulance, 47.5% requireda CT scan and 29% were admitted to hospital. Bloodsamples were obtained a median of 87.2 min (IQR=52 – 105 min) from the time of crash.Table 1shows the general characteristics of these injured drivers.

Brubacher JR,et al.BMJ Open2016;6:e009278. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2015-009278 3Open Accessgroup.bmj.com on July 31, 2017 - Published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/Downloaded from  AlcoholAlcohol was present in 17.8% of drivers. Most alcohol-positive drivers (86.7%) had alcohol concentrations thatexceeded the Canadian federal legal limit of 0.08%.Alcohol was detected more often in male (23.0%) thanin female drivers (8.4%) (OR=3.26, 95% CI 2.17 to5.01), and in drivers under the age of 30 years(OR=3.64, 95% CI 2.61 to 5.08). Drivers who requiredadmission to hospital (OR=1.89, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.64)and those involved in night-time crashes (OR=12.45,95% CI 8.23 to 18.84) or in single-vehicle crashes(OR=6.99, 95% CI 4.91 to 10.06) were also more likelyto have used alcohol (table 2).CannabisThe second most common recreational drug, and mostcommon illicit drug, detected was cannabis: 12.6% ofdrivers tested positive for cannabis metabolites(THC-COOH), 7.3% were positive forΔ-9-THC and3.0% hadΔ-9-THC > 3 ng/mL (the Norwegian legallimit).Δ-9-THC was more often detected in male drivers(OR=2.17, 95% CI 1.23 to 4.02), in drivers aged under30 years (OR=2.29, 95% CI 1.40 to 3.72) and in thoseinvolved in single-vehicle crashes (OR=1.64, 95% CI 1.00to 2.65).Δ-9-THC was not found signiﬁcantly moreoften in drivers admitted to hospital nor in thoseinvolved in night-time crashes or weekend crashes.Drivers aged under 30 years were more likely to haveΔ-9-THC >3 ng/mL (OR=2.73, 95% CI 1.28 to 5.85), butΔ-9-THC >3 ng/mL was not found signiﬁcantly moreoften in other groups of drivers (table 2).Other illicit drugsCocaine was positive in 2.8% of drivers and ampheta-mines in 1.2%. We found a high prevalence ofmorphine (6.0%) in this sample of injured drivers. Afterexcluding cases where morphine was given prior toblood draw by paramedics (n=21) or in the ED (n=22),morphine was detectable in 23 cases (2.1%). Our ana-lysis did not allow us to identify which morphine-positivecases, if any, were due to heroin use. Heroin is notdetected in blood samples since it is rapidly metabolisedto 6-acetylmorphine and then to morphine.Identiﬁcation of heroin requires analysis of either urineor saliva samples which we did not have access to.12
(table 2).MedicationsMedications including benzodiazepines (4.0%), zopi-clone (0.6%), antidepressants (6.5%) and opiatesincluding morphine (4.8%) were also detected.Benzodiazepines were detected in 55 drivers (5%), but13 of these were given benzodiazepines by medical staffprior to blood draw, so benzodiazepines were used by 42drivers (4.0%) prior to the crash. Similarly, the antihista-mine diphenhydramine was detected in 121 drivers(11.0%), but 75 of these had been given the antinau-seant dimenhydrinate by paramedics or hospital staffprior to blood draw. Treatment with dimenhydrinate(diphenhydramine-8-chloro-theophyllinate) will producea positive test for diphenhydramine, so we excludedthese 75 cases. Therefore, 46 drivers (4.7%) had useddiphenhydramine prior to the crash. In total, 19.9% ofdrivers were positive for at least one sedating medica-tion. Drivers aged under 50 years (OR=0.67, 95% CI0.49 to 0.92) were less likely to test positive for a medica-tion, and those who were admitted to hospital(OR=2.50, 95% CI 1.82 to 3.44) had the highest rate ofmedication use (table 2).Poly drug useOverall, 40.1% of drivers tested positive for alcohol orat least one impairing drug and 12.7% tested positivefor more than one substance. The most common com-binations of drugs were medications plus recreationaldrugs (3.5%), alcohol plus cannabis (ie,Δ-9-THC posi-tive—1.6%), alcohol plus medications (2.4%) andalcohol plus recreational drugs (2.3%) (ﬁgure 2). Compared with non-drinking drivers, drivers who hadbeen drinking were more likely to also use other drugs.In particular, cannabis and alcohol were often usedtogether and drivers who tested positive for alcoholwere also more likely to test positive for cannabis andvice versa (ﬁgure 3).DISCUSSIONIn this population, alcohol was the most commonlydetected drug and was present in 17.8% of drivers. Mostalcohol-positive drivers had blood alcohol concentration(BAC) >0.08%, the Canadian legal limit for driving.Alcohol is well known to impair driving ability and causecollisions.

Brubacher JR,et al.BMJ Open2016;6:e009278. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2015-009278 5Open Accessgroup.bmj.com on July 31, 2017 - Published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/Downloaded from  alcohol consumption and is highest in young driversand at higher BAC levels.
32 33As expected, alcohol wasmore common in night-time drivers, in males, indrivers involved in single-vehicle crashes and in ser-iously injured drivers who required admission to hos-pital. The prevalence of alcohol use in this populationof drivers, although high, is lower than typically seen instudies of injured drivers. For example, in previousresearch in BC, we found that 47.1% of drivers cap-tured in the BC trauma registry tested positive foralcohol.
34The lower prevalence in the current studylikely reﬂects the fact that we are studying less severelyinjured patients (although all required bloodwork, onlya third were admitted to hospital) and may also reﬂect a decrease in alcohol use by BC drivers followingpublic campaigns against drunk driving and implemen-tation of new trafﬁc laws in BC (September 2010).These new laws targeted drinking drivers with immedi-ate licence suspension and vehicle impoundment andresulted in marked reductions in alcohol-related fataland injury crashes.
35
After alcohol, cannabis was the next most commonlydetected recreational drug. Like alcohol, cannabisimpairs driving ability
4and increases the risk ofcrashes, although to a lesser extent than alcohol.
14 36– 38
We found evidence suggesting recent cannabis use(THC positive) in 7.3% of drivers. We also found that3.0% of our drivers hadΔ-9-THC levels above theNorwegian legal limit (THC=3 ng/mL) and 12.6%were cannabis users (ie, THC-COOH positive).Δ-9-THC >3 ng/mL was more common in males and indrivers aged under 30 years but, unlike the case withalcohol, was not seen more commonly in drivers admit-ted to hospital, nor in those involved in night-time orsingle-vehicle crashes. It is possible that the numbers ofdrivers who use cannabis will increase with the recentboom in medical marijuana dispensaries of BC.In addition to alcohol and cannabis, we found signiﬁ- cant numbers of drivers who tested positive for illicit sti-mulants (cocaine, amphetamines). Stimulants actuallyimprove some measures of driving ability such as reac-tion time,
39 40but in higher doses, stimulants impairjudgment and are found to increase the risk of crashingin some studies.
38 41We also found a high prevalenceof the antihistamine, diphenhydramine.Diphenhydramine, often sold under the brand nameBenadryl, is a common over-the-counter antihistaminethat is used to treat allergic reactions, as a sleep aid (eg,Nytol), and as an ingredient of the antinausea medica-tion Gravol (as dimenhydrinate). Antihistamines causedrowsiness and are known to impair driving perform-ance.
42Other sedating medications including opiates(morphine, codeine, methadone), benzodiazepines,Z-drugs (zopiclone) and antidepressants (tricyclic anti-depressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,etc) were also common. Medications were mostcommon in drivers aged over 50 years and in thoserequiring hospital admission.Table 2Continued

Ourﬁnding of posi-tive THC-COOH in 12.6% of drivers is slightly higherthan that reported from Chicago in 1994 (7.4%),
26
similar to Stodutoet al’s24study from Toronto (13.9%),and far lower than the THC-COOH-positive ratesreported from Colorado in 2001 (16.9%),
25or Baltimore in 2005 (26.9%).
27Only one other NorthAmerican study was able to detect recent cannabis use(ie,Δ-9-THC positive), but ourﬁnding that 7.3% ofdrivers test positive forΔ-9-THC is similar to the resultsof recent studies from Australia,
22 43Belgium44andFrance,45lower than that seen in Spain,46or Toronto-Halifax,
28and higher than that reported fromNorway,
47Denmark19or the Netherlands (2012).44
In BC, the prevalence of drug and alcohol use innon-crash-involved drivers has also been studied in aseries of roadside surveys which studied consentingdrivers during weekend evenings and nights. In the mostrecent survey (2012), 6.5% of drivers had been drinkingand 7.4% tested positive for another impairing drug,most commonly cannabis or cocaine.
48Although ourcrash-involved drivers cannot be directly compared withdrivers from the roadside survey, the fact that we foundFigure 2Polysubstance use.This Venn diagram shows thenumber and per cent of driverstesting positive for variouscombinations of substances. Thefont size for each drugcombination is proportional to itsprevalence.

As seen in thisfigure (top panel), cannabis-positive drivers were more likelythan other drivers to have alsoused alcohol. Similarly (middlepanel), alcohol-positive driversare more likely than other driversto be cannabis users (detectableTHC-COOH), or to have recentlyused cannabis (detectableΔ-9-THC), but were not morelikely to haveΔ-9-THC levelsabove the Norwegian limit of3 ng/mL (middle panel).

Instead ofusing urine samples, we analysed blood samples to deter-mine the prevalence of recent drug use in injureddrivers. Most previous North American studies wereunable to distinguish between drivers with positive meta-bolites and those with active drug in their blood. An add-itional strength is that, rather than reporting the resultsof drug screening performed for clinical purposes (ie,based on clinical suspicion of drug use), we analysedexcess blood that had been obtained for other clinicalpurposes (ie, not for drug screening) and that remainedafter clinical use. In this way, we studied a more repre-sentative sample of injured drivers who required blood-work as part of their clinical care and avoided the risk ofselecting only drivers who were suspected of using drugs.In addition, this study had research ethics boardapproval for waiver of consent because we used excessblood that had been obtained for clinical use and wasgoing to be discarded, and because of the procedureswe put in place making it impossible to link toxicologyresults back to an individual driver. The advantage ofthis is that we avoid the selection bias that could occur ifconsent was required and drivers who used drugs weremore likely to refuse to participate.LimitationsOur study also has several weaknesses that result fromour reliance on excess blood. First, the excess bloodvolumes are small which limits analysis in some cases. Inparticular, we did not always have sufﬁcient blood toperform quantiﬁcation of drugs (other than cannabi-noids). However, the analytic process is sufﬁcient for thepurpose of detecting presence versus absence of alldrugs. Second, we obtained blood from only thosedrivers who had serious enough injuries that theyrequired blood analysis as part of routine care. Thismeans that drivers with minor injuries were not includedand ourﬁndings do not apply to drivers with less severeinjuries.CONCLUSIONSAlcohol, cannabis and other impairing drugs were com-monly detected in injured BC drivers. Alcohol and can-nabis were both found more commonly in males and indrivers aged under 30 years. Many drivers used alcoholand cannabis together, resulting in increased impair-ment. Legal impairing medications were also commonlydetected. Medications are used more often in driversaged over 50 years and in drivers who require admissionto hospital after a crash.Alcohol and, to a lesser extent, cannabis are knownto cause crashes. Ourﬁndings suggest that alcoholcontinues to be the most important cause ofimpaired driving, followed by cannabis. The numberof drivers using cannabis may increase with thegrowing numbers of medical marijuana dispensariesin BC and with legalisation of marijuana in some USstates. Impairing medications are also a signiﬁcant concern and, as the population ages, the prevalenceof medication use by drivers is likely to increase evenhigher. The crash risk associated with most impairingmedications is poorly studied and more work in thisﬁeld is required to inform educational programmesdesigned to prevent medication-involved crashes. Inaddition, many drivers use several drugs in combin-ation and more research is required to understandthe risk of impairment associated with polysubstanceuse.As the population ages, the prevalence of medicationuse by drivers will likely increase. More work is neededto understand the role of medications in causing crashesto guide driver education programmes and improvepublic safety.

OUR AIM
MARC is dedicated to finding solutions that transform the way we think about and respond to addiction. ABOUT US
The Monash Addiction Research Centre (MARC) brings together world-leading expertise from across Monash University and the sector to provide solutions to the challenges of addiction. 
We have over 100 academic members across eight faculties (28 departments) and two institutes, making us one of the largest addiction research centres centres in the world. The work conducted by our membership encompasses three key themes of addiction research activity: Science Culture & Policy  Prevention & Treatment Our focus is on building interdisciplinary collaboration and addiction research capacity to:  Position MARC to conduct innovative research that transforms addiction science, practice and policy  Leverage our clinical-academic partnerships, including with Peninsula Health, to test local solutions with the potential for national upscaling and impact. 4 MONASH ADDICTION RESEARCH CENTRE – ANNUAL REPORT 2019
 We are pleased to present the Monash Addiction Research Centre’s Annual Report   for 2018-2019
The Monash Addiction Research Centre (MARC) formally commenced operations in late April 2018. With a physical hub at the Monash Peninsula campus in Frankston, our mission is to provide national solutions to addiction by drawing on the multidisciplinary strengths and capabilities of researchers from across the University to develop and test novel scalable prevention and treatment strategies. MARC’s expertise in basic and social science, clinical and epidemiological research enables us to develop new knowledge to shape government policy and test evidence-based approaches.MARC’s addiction research activity spans three key themes: Science, Culture & Policy, and Prevention & Treatment. Each area is represented by theme leaders who help inform MARC's strategic direction, and promote activities and opportunities that facilitate interdisciplinary learning and development.In our first year, we have focused on developing relationships with key academics at the Peninsula Campus, building links between addiction researchers from different faculties of Monash, forging partnerships with local government and community organisations across the Frankston Mornington Peninsula, and building a broad network of project partners.We have made progress in strengthening these connections through the development of the MARC website, the establishment of our monthly member newsletter, and building our social media profile. In September 2018, we also co-hosted our first symposium on opioid overdose in Victoria, together with the Centre for Research Excellence into Injecting Drug Use (CREIDU).Our research funding has seen MARC members awarded more than $16M in funding revenue, demonstrating the strength of our researchers and interdisciplinary collaboration. We also are excited to be part of the new $32M National Centre for Healthy Ageing in partnership with Peninsula Health, which will bring together leading researchers, clinicians, industry and the community to tackle the key challenges associated with healthy ageing, including addiction.On behalf of MARC, we would like to thank our members, research partners and the community for their contribution to the Centre’s inaugural year and we look forward to building on this success in 2019/20.

RESEARCH REPORT
Here we have chosen select examples of research completed in the 2018/2019 year. 
‘Pregabalin misuse-related ambulance attendances in Victoria, 2012-2017: characteristics of patients and attendances’
Investigators: Dr Rose Crossin, Dr Debbie Scott, Dr Shalini Arunogiri,  Associate/Professor Karen Smith, Professor Paul Dietze and  Professor Dan Lubman.The study found that the rate of pregabalin-related ambulance call-outs has increased tenfold since 2012. This increase is associated with an increase in the national prescription rate, including an increase in the off-label prescription rate. The study also revealed that co-use with other sedatives was common and called for greater care when prescribing pregabalin.A collaboration between Turning Point, Burnet Institute, MARC and the School of Primary and Allied Health Care.

‘Addiction in the Australian legal system:   A sociological analysis’
Investigator : Associate Professor Kate SeearHarms associated with alcohol and other drugs (AOD) cost Australia over $25 billion per year. The law plays a central role in managing these harms. Legal responses to AOD and the key concept of 'addiction' are often inconsistent. These variations have unintended and often adverse, economic, social and health implications. Using an international comparative method involving Australia and Canada, this research seeks to critically analyse legal approaches to addiction, isolating the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches. This project aimed to inform more productive legal responses to addiction, and was expected to produce recommendations for improving AOD-related outcomes in Australia.

Jennifer H. Martin,3,4Murat Yu¨cel,2and Nadia Solowij1,4,*AbstractIntroduction:Chronic cannabis use is associated with neuroanatomical alterations in the hippocampus. Whileadverse impacts of cannabis use are generally attributed toD
9-tetrahydrocannabinol, emerging naturalistic ev- idence suggests cannabidiol (CBD) is neuroprotective and may ameliorate brain harms associated with cannabisuse, including protection from hippocampal volume loss. This study examined whether prolonged administra-tion of CBD to regular cannabis users within the community could reverse or reduce the characteristic hippo-campal harms associated with chronic cannabis use.Materials and Methods:Eighteen regular cannabis users participated in an*10-week open-label pragmatic trial involving daily oral administration of 200 mg CBD, with no change to their ongoing cannabis use requested.Participants were assessed at baseline and post-CBD treatment using structural magnetic resonance imaging.Automated longitudinal hippocampal segmentation was performed to assess volumetric change over thewhole hippocampus and within 12 subﬁelds.Results:No change was observed in left or right hippocampus as a whole. However, left subicular complex (par-asubiculum, presubiculum, and subiculum) volume signiﬁcantly increased from baseline to post-treatment(p=0.017 uncorrected) by 1.58% (Cohen’sd=0.63; 2.83% in parasubiculum). Heavy cannabis users demonstrated marked growth in the left subicular complex, predominantly within the presubiculum, and right cornu ammonis(CA)1 compared to lighter users. Associations between greater right subicular complex and total hippocampalvolume and higher plasma CBD concentration were evident, particularly in heavy users.Conclusions:Our ﬁndings suggest a restorative effect of CBD on the subicular and CA1 subﬁelds in current can-nabis users, especially those with greater lifetime exposure to cannabis. While replication is required in a larger,placebo-controlled trial, these ﬁndings support a protective role of CBD against brain structural harms conferredby chronic cannabis use. Furthermore, these outcomes suggest that CBD may be a useful adjunct in treatmentsfor cannabis dependence and may be therapeutic for a range of clinical disorders characterized by hippocampalpathology (e.g., schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, and major depressive disorder).Keywords:CA1; cannabidiol; cannabis; hippocampal subﬁelds; hippocampus; subiculum

 Introduction
Regular and prolonged cannabis use has been associatedwith morphological
1,2and functional brain changes,2–4
cognitive impairment,5and increased risk of adversemental health outcomes, including the precipitation ofpsychotic symptoms and disorders.
6,7Neuroimaging ev-idence has consistently identiﬁed the hippocampus, asubcortical brain region critically involved in learningand memory and implicated in psychopathology, as aparticular locus of compromise.
1,2Long-term heavy can-nabis users have demonstrated reduced hippocampalvolume
8,9and gray matter density10compared to non-user controls, with some evidence for greater volumeloss resulting from greater exposure to cannabis.
1Alter-ations to hippocampal shape,
11neurochemistry,8and structural
12and functional connectivity13in chroniccannabis users have also been reported. Recently, weshowed that volumetric reduction of speciﬁc hippo-campal subﬁelds (cornu ammonis [CA]1–4 and den-tate gyrus [DG]) was sensitive to cannabis dependence,with an inverse correlation between greater lifetime can-nabis exposure and subﬁeld volumes in dependent, butnot nondependent users.
14
Cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1Rs) are abundantthroughout the brain, but occur in high density in speciﬁcregions, including the hippocampus.
15Cannabis-relatedneurobiological, cognitive, and psychological harmsare generally ascribed toD
9-tetrahydrocannabinol(THC), the primary psychoactive constituent of can-nabis, which is a partial agonist at CB1Rs.
16,17Acuteadministration of THC to humans dose-dependentlytransiently increases anxiety, impairs cognition, andinduces a range of positive and negative psychotic-like symptoms, including paranoia, delusions, andconceptual disorganization.
18–20While the precisemechanisms underlying these effects are not well un-derstood, animal studies have shown that THC accu-mulates in neurons,
21with long-term exposure toTHC resulting in neurotoxic changes in hippocampalmicrostructure.
22Conversely, cannabidiol (CBD) isthe second most abundant cannabinoid in cannabisa n dh a sp u r p o r t e dn e u r o p r o t e c t i v e ,
23anxiolytic,24
and antipsychotic25properties. Acutely administered,CBD exerts opposing effects to THC upon activationof speciﬁc brain regions, including the hippocam-pus,
26and ameliorates the induction of hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairment and psychotic-likesymptoms by THC in healthy volunteers.
27CBD hasa low afﬁnity for CB1Rs, yet demonstrates the capacityto antagonize CB1R agonists, which may underlie itsfunctional antagonism of THC.28Preclinical studieshave shown CBD to induce synaptic plasticity andfacilitate hippocampal neurogenesis,
29,30with someevidence suggesting that the proneurogenic actionof CBD via the hippocampus may underlie its anxiolyticeffects.
30Although precise neurobiological mechanismsby which CBD may promote neurogenesis remain un-clear, modulation of endocannabinoids such as ananda-mide through CB1Rs has been implicated.
29,31
In recent years, increasingly potent strains of cannabiscontaining high levels of THC and decreasing levels ofCBD have dominated the market, raising concerns forgreater THC-related harms in the community.
7,32Natu-ralistic studies examining proportional exposure to THCand CBD by hair analysis of chronic cannabis usersfound that the presence of CBD in cannabis was as-sociated with fewer psychotic-like symptoms,
33,34
improved recognition memory,34and increased hippo-campal gray matter concentration.
10We have recentlyshown apparent normalization of hippocampal volumeand n-acetylaspartate (NAA; a marker of hippocampalneuronal integrity) levelsin cannabis users regularlysmoking cannabis containing CBD, such that theywere indistinguishable from controls, while those exposedto THC but not CBD, showed 11% smaller hippocampalvolumes and 15% lower NAA concentrations than con-trols.
8These ﬁndings indicate CBD may protect againstneurobiological and psychological harms of regular can-nabis use; however, the cross-sectional nature of thesestudies precludes any inferences about directionality.The possibility that prolonged administration ofCBD to cannabis users may protect against or reduceTHC-induced harms is intriguing. The hippocampusis highly neuroplastic and volume growth has beendemonstrated following relatively brief interventions(e.g., increase in hippocampal volume by 12% in pa-tients with schizophrenia and 16% in healthy controlsfollowing 12 weeks of aerobic exercise,
35indicatingthis is an adequate timeframe to observe discernibletreatment effects in the hippocampus). Hence, thisstudy aimed to investigate whether prolonged adminis-tration of CBD may reverse hippocampal volumetricreduction typically observed in long-term, heavy can-nabis users, but recruitment was broadened to enableexamination of effects of CBD treatment in a samplewith a range of cannabis experience. An*10-weekpragmatic, open-label trial was undertaken, in whichcannabis users within the community consumed 200 mgCBD in capsule form daily, in the context of their ongo-ing cannabis use. Structural magnetic resonance imagingBeale,et al.; Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research 2018, 3.1 http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/can.2017.0047 95
 (MRI) scans were completed at baseline and post-CBDtreatment. It was hypothesized that prolonged CBDadministration would result in increased hippocampalvolume at post-treatment, as subserved by growth inspeciﬁc subﬁelds such as CA1, subiculum, and DG,due to the high concentration of CB1Rs in these subre-gions
15and their involvement in neurogenesis.36
Materials and MethodsParticipants
Twenty regular cannabis users (at least once per monthfor a minimum 6 months) aged 18–55 years wererecruited from the community through newspaperand online advertisements. Exclusion criteria were cur-rent or past regular (greater than once per month for>6 months in the past 3 years) other illicit drug use ordependence on or treatment-seeking for any substanceother than cannabis; history of synthetic cannabinoiduse; any neurological disorder or serious head injury;psychiatric history (assessed by the Mini-InternationalNeuropsychiatric Interview Plus
37) or medication use;pregnancy or lack of contraception for female cannabisusers; and contraindications for MRI. Eighteen partic-ipants completed both baseline and post-treatmentMRI scans and are reported in this study. Participantsprovided informed written consent at baseline, post-treatment, and each weekly session (see Procedure,CBD administration, and dose section), and were reim-bursed for their participation. The study was approvedby the University of Wollongong and Illawarra andShoalhaven Local Health District Health and MedicalHuman Research Ethics Committee and registered asa clinical trial (ISRCTN89498802).
Procedure, CBD administration, and dose
Further detail regarding the methodology of thispragmatic trial is provided by Solowij et al. (compan-ion article
38). In brief, participants attended twocomprehensive testing sessions at the beginning(baseline) and completion (post-treatment) of*10 weeks of CBD administration, involving MRI scan-ning and other assessments (electroencephalography,neuropsychological, and clinical, not reported in thisstudy). Participants were also required to attend briefweekly appointments throughout the trial for moni-toring of physiological and psychological well-being,collection of blood and urine samples, and provisionof CBD capsules. Participants were not asked to makeany changes to their cannabis use patterns during thetrial, but were instructed toabstain from cannabis, al-cohol, and other substances for a minimum 12 h be-fore baseline and post-treatment testing sessions.Participants were requested to abstain from use of il-licit substances other than cannabis throughout thetrial and were advised urine drug screens would beconducted to corroborate their self-report.38
At each weekly session, participants were provided28 gelatin-coated capsules for oral administration con-taining 50 mg of 99.5% pure crystalline CBD (of herbalorigin) solved in Miglyol 812 and Softisan 378 (TrigalPharma Ltd.; BioSynthesis Pharma Group Ltd.). Partic-ipants were instructed to consume four capsules perday (100 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening,totaling 200 mg daily). This was selected as a ‘‘medium’’dose in accordance with the range of therapeutic dosesreported in human studies (e.g., 800–1000 mg/day welltolerated for up to 6 weeks in psychotic individuals
39,40), as well as for caution as no previous study had admin-istered prolonged and relatively high doses of CBD tocurrent cannabis users. Participants received an SMStext message each morning and evening remindingthem to consume their capsules. At each weekly session,participants returned any unused capsules. Adherencewas measured by participants self-reporting the timesof any missed doses, using a Timeline Follow-Back Pro-cedure,
41and corroborated by the number of capsulesreturned.
Measures
Participants’ demographic data were obtained andlifetime substance use quantiﬁed through structuredinterview. The Timeline Follow-Back Procedure
41
was employed at baseline and each subsequent sessionto obtain a speciﬁc and accurate history of substanceuse throughout the trial (cumulative cannabis, alcohol,and tobacco use across the trial quantiﬁed). Cannabisuse was converted to standardized units of ‘‘cones’’(1 joint=3 cones; https://cannabissupport.com.au/media/1593/timeline-followback.pdf) for quantiﬁca-tion. The Alcohol Use Disorders IdentiﬁcationTest,
42Severity of Dependence Scale,43and CannabisWithdrawal Scale
44were administered at baselineand post-treatment to assess extent of alcohol con-sumption, severity of cannabis dependence, and can-nabis withdrawal symptoms from abstaining before thetest session. Blood and urine samples were collected ateach session to enable assay of CBD, THC, and THCmetabolite concentrations in plasma
45(following trialcompletion), and for corroboration of self-reportedsubstance use by urine toxicology.Beale,et al.; Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research 2018, 3.1 http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/can.2017.0047 96
 Vocabulary and matrix reasoning subscales of theWechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence
46were ad-ministered at baseline to estimate full scale intelligencequotient (IQ). Psychological symptoms of depression,anxiety, and psychosis-proneness were assessed atbaseline and post-treatment using the following stan-dardized measures: Beck Depression Inventory
47; StateTrait Anxiety Index
48; Community Assessment ofPsychic Experiences
49; and Cannabis ExperiencesQuestionnaire (CEQ).
50Alternate forms of the ReyAuditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT),
51demon-strated to be sensitive to cannabis-related memoryimpairment,
52,53were also administered at baselineand post-treatment.
MRI acquisition and processing
Participants underwent structural MRI scans on a3T Siemens Skyra with a 48-channel head and neckcoil using a T1-weighted gradient echo sequence,MPRAGE, with 900 ms inversion time, TR/TE of2300/2.1 ms, FA=9, 192 slices 1 mm thick, ﬁeld ofview=256·256 mm, and matrix=256·256, resultingin 1.0 mm isotropic resolution and a total acquisitiontime of 5 min and 26 sec. Participants also underwentother MRI scan sequences not reported in this study.T1-weighted images were processed using an automatedlongitudinal hippocampal subﬁeld segmentation proto-col available through FreeSurfer neuroimaging softwareversion 6.0 (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu).
54Thistechnique relies upon the creation of an unbiasedsubject-speciﬁc atlas, which each within-subject timepoint is then reprocessed against, to reduce within-subject variability.
55Furthermore, it has demonstratedgreater sensitivity in identifying subtle hippocampalsubregional changes than previous cross-sectional pro-cessing methods.
54Images were ﬁrst processed throughthe longitudinal FreeSurfer stream,
55involving mo-tion correction, skull stripping, intensity normaliza-tion, Talairach transformation, atlas registration,estimation of total intracranial volume, segmentationof white and gray matter volumes, and parcellation ofsubcortical structures, including the hippocampus.Hippocampal segmentation was then applied, generat-ing volumes for whole left and right hippocampi as wellas 12 subﬁelds for each (parasubiculum, presubiculum,subiculum, CA1, CA2/3, CA4, granule cells in themolecular layer of the dentate gyrus [GC-ML-DG],hippocampal-amygdala transition area, ﬁmbria, molec-ular layer of the dentate gyrus [ML-DG], hippocampalﬁssure, and hippocampal tail), as depicted in Figure 1.Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version21.0. Pairedt-tests were conducted to assess volumetricchange from baseline to post-treatment for total leftand right hippocampal volumes and for the 12 sub-ﬁelds comprising each. As this was a novel exploratorypilot study in a small sample with no placebo control,no adjustment was made for multiple comparisons.Correlations examined associations between change inhippocampal subregion volume (post-treatment minusbaseline volume, in mm

Results
Demographic, substance use, and psychological symp-tom characteristics of the sample are summarized inTable 1. Participants were predominantly young adultmales (median age 25 years; four females), most ofwhom had completed some tertiary education. Partici-pants had used cannabis regularly for a median of 5.17years and at baseline were smoking cannabis a medianof 25.75 days per month. Cannabis frequency and quan-tity measures did not signiﬁcantly differ from baseline topost-treatment, indicating that a consistent level of can-nabis use was maintained by participants throughout thetrial. Most participants refrained from other illicit druguse during the trial
38(the one exception was not an out-lier on any hippocampal measures and his data wereretained in the analyses reported in this study). MedianCBD capsule adherence was 93.16% (range 68.67–99.35%). Participants reported experiencing less euphoriawhen smoking cannabis (lower CEQ Euphoria scores)at post-treatment compared to baseline (p=0.001).Changes in other psychological symptoms and cogni-tion from baseline to post-treatment in this sample areprovided in Table 1 and reported in detail in a slightlylarger sample by Solowij et al.

Mean and signiﬁcance values of all hippocampal volu-metric comparisons are presented in Table 2. Paired sam-plest-tests revealed no signiﬁcant change in total leftor right hippocampal volume, nor in nine hippocampalsubﬁelds. However, a signiﬁcant increase in left parasu-biculum volume was observed (p=0.035), with trend-level increases in the left presubiculum (p=0.058) andleft subiculum (p=0.066). In addition, a trend towarddecreased volume in the right presubiculum was foundBeale,et al.; Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research 2018, 3.1 http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/can.2017.0047 97
 (p=0.056). Subsequently, to increase reliability, total vol-umes of all subicular subﬁelds (parasubiculum, presubic-ulum, and subiculum) were pooled to create a ‘‘subicularcomplex’’
56,57for each hemisphere. Paired samplest-testsshowed a signiﬁcant increase in left subicular complexvolume (p=0.017; Cohen’sd=0.63), but no changein the right subicular complex (p=0.471; Cohen’sd=0.17). Changes in left and right subicular complexand substructures are detailed in Table 3.Correlations did not reveal any signiﬁcant associationbetween left subicular complex or subregion volumechange and plasma CBD concentration, cumulativeCBD dose (calculated by number of capsules returnedby participants), or weeks of CBD treatment. Rightsubicular complex volumetric change was signiﬁcantlycorrelated with plasma CBD concentration in the ﬁnaltrial week (r=0.62,p=0.006), as well as a trend-levelassociation with mean CBD plasma concentrationover the trial (r=0.45,p=0.064), suggesting thathigher plasma CBD was associated with increasedgrowth in this area, despitethe overall tendency to-ward a decrease in this region from baseline to post-

 treatment (Table 3). Age was not signiﬁcantly corre-lated with any subicular change, other than at trendlevel in the left parasubiculum (r=/C00.43,p=0.073),indicating growth in this subregion was more pro-nounced in younger participants, potentially implicat-ing a role of brain maturation. Subicular complex orsubregion volume change did not signiﬁcantly corre-late with any substance use measures; importantly,change in left subicular complex volume was not asso-ciated with changes in alcohol use frequency or quan-tity from baseline to post-treatment (bothp>0.601),nor with cumulative quantity of cannabis, alcohol,or cigarettes used over the trial (allp>0.114). Leftsubiculum volume was correlated with lifetime dura-tion of cannabis use at baseline (r=/C00.54,p=0.021;trend for left subicular complex volumer=/C00.44, p=0.066), suggesting that smaller volumes at baselinewere associated with greaterc a n n a b i se x p o s u r e ,a n dthese normalized with CBD treatment.

This suggests that in-creased volume in these subicular regions was associatedwith lesser desired level of ‘‘high’’ following CBD treat-ment. No signiﬁcant correlations between subicular com-plex or subregion volumes and psychological symptomor cognitive (RAVLT) measures were found.Hippocampal volume change was further exploredbetween and within groups of heavy and light users(median split on lifetime occasions of use,n=9[ s e v e nmale, eight right handed] each). Group differences incannabis use measures are presented in Table 4. Heavyand light users signiﬁcantly differed on lifetime cannabisuse, frequency and quantity of cannabis use at baselineand post-treatment, cumulative cones smoked acrossTable 1.

Discussion
This study reports outcomes from the ﬁrst trial of pro-longed CBD treatment to cannabis users within thecommunity. We performed an automated longitudinalhippocampal subﬁeld segmentation to examine the po-tential for chronic CBD administration to restore char-acteristic hippocampal volumetric reduction in regularcannabis users. We found an overall signiﬁcant increaseof left subicular complex volume from baseline to post-treatment, subserved by growth in the left parasubicu-lum, presubiculum, and subiculum, with medium-largeeffect sizes. We compared heavy and light users to ex-plore the inﬂuence of prior cannabis exposure on CBDtreatment outcomes, ﬁnding that the increased left sub-icular complex volume was driven by heavy users, par-ticularly the marked growth that occurred in the leftpresubiculum, which normalized post-treatment vol-umes toward those observed in light users. Similarly,only heavy users showed a signiﬁcant increase in rightCA1 volume over the trial. Despite an overall trend to-ward decreased right presubiculum volume from base-line to post-treatment, signiﬁcant associations betweenhigher plasma CBD concentration and increased growthin this region were apparent, particularly in heavy users.Plasma CBD concentration was also signiﬁcantly corre-lated with right subicular complex and total right hippo-campal growth in heavy users.These ﬁndings suggest a regionally speciﬁc restor-ative effect of CBD upon the subicular and CA1 sub-ﬁelds for heavy cannabis users, in the context ofongoing and relatively consistent cannabis use duringthe trial. The subicular subregions receive projectionsfrom CA1 and function as the primary hippocampaloutput structures, interfacing with the entorhinal cor-tex and a range of cortical and subcortical sites.58
Functionally, CA1 neurons are critically involved inthe representation of temporal and spatial contextualinformation and retrieval of episodic memory,
59,60
while a dorsal-ventral functional segmentation hasbeen suggested for subicular subregions, wherebydorsal subiculum is involved in spatial representationand memory and ventral subiculum is involved inhypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal regulation of stress,anxiety, and reward.
61
Subicular and CA1 subregions are implicated in path-ophysiological models of various conditions.

 precipitates attenuated psychotic symptoms, and ex-tends to the subiculum during the transition to frankpsychosis.
71–73Longitudinal studies in ultra-high-riskpatients have demonstrated focal atrophy of CA1, at arate of 6% per year, differentiates those who progressonto syndromal psychosis and those whose attenuatedpsychotic symptom remit, with an extension of atrophyto the subiculum then other subﬁelds as the illness pro-gresses.73,74The rate of CA1 volume reduction speciﬁ-cally was found to predict worsening of symptomseverity over time,
74highlighting the importance of pre-venting degeneration in this subregion. Furthermore, inschizophrenia patients, subiculum volume reduction hasbeen associated with increased negative symptoms,
65
and left presubiculum atrophy has been correlatedwith impairments in episodic memory.

 Interestingly, 12 weeks of antipsychotic treatmentwas found to increase subicular (but not CA1) volume(encompassing all subicular subregions) by an average32 mm
3(2.55%) in patients experiencing a ﬁrst-episodepsychosis, while a healthy young adult control group(of a similar age to the sample reported in this study;mean [standard deviation]: 22.2 [4.9]) showed negli-gible change in this region (/C00.53%) over the same pe-riod.
76This suggests natural ﬂuctuation in subicularvolume or the inﬂuence of ongoing brain maturationacross our similar trial length and participant sampleis unlikely, supporting a CBD treatment effect. Giventhe parallels observed in schizophrenia pathophysiol-ogy and neurobiological changes conferred by chroniccannabis use,
77,78and interest in the antipsychoticproperties of CBD,25our ﬁnding of volumetric restora-tion in the subicular and CA1 regions is promising, andthis therapeutic indication for CBD may extend tobeneﬁtting other clinical groups (e.g., schizophrenia).The greater volumetric increase in heavy cannabisusers is consistent with psychological symptom andcognitive outcomes from this trial, showing that depen-dent users experienced a signiﬁcantly greater reductionin depressive and psychotic-like symptoms and im-proved cognition compared to nondependent users(reporting onn=20 participants
38). In addition, we re-cently demonstrated protective effects of chronic CBDtreatment against the development of negative psychotic-like symptoms in a preclinical model of schizophrenia,with no effect in control animals.

 may have occurred in lighter users, our ﬁndings never-theless provide further support for the contention thatCBD may confer greater therapeutic effects in a morecompromised brain.Our ﬁndings suggest a restorative effect of CBD onhippocampal substructures in cannabis users, evenwithin the context of continued cannabis use. In theabsence of ongoing use, as might occur in a motivatedtreatment-seeking sample, greater neurotherapeuticbeneﬁt may be expected. During the trial, participantsreported feeling less high after using cannabis and thiswas corroborated by signiﬁcant reduction at post-treatment on the CEQ Euphoria subscale. As such,CBD may be a valuable adjunct to psychological treat-ments for cannabis dependence. Furthermore, subjec-tive ratings of preferred level of cannabis intoxicationwere negatively associated with increased subicular re-gion growth.A critical limitation of this study was that it was apragmatic, open-label trial without a placebo control.While it is unlikely that brain structural measures areamenable to expectancy effects, our ﬁndings shouldnevertheless be interpreted with caution. In addition,the sample was relatively high-functioning, and someparticipants’ cannabis use was infrequent. If thera-peutic effects of CBD are more likely to manifest ina disease state, this gives even greater credence toour ﬁndings and stronger effects may be expected inam o r ee n t r e n c h e ds a m p l e .A st h em a j o r i t yo fp a r t i c -ipants were young adult males, the inﬂuence of ongo-ing brain maturation must be considered and futureresearch should examine age effects as well as potentialsex differences in CBD treatment effects. That some hip-pocampal subﬁeld volume changes were associated withplasma CBD concentrations supports the changes beingCBD treatment related. Nevertheless, replication in alarger sample placebo-controlled trial is warranted.The mechanisms underlying a restorative effect ofCBD on hippocampal subﬁelds in cannabis users re-main to be elucidated. While neurogenesis is plausible,no change was observed in the DG, the primary hippo-campal subregion implicated in neurogenesis. The po-tential involvement of both CB1Rs and glutamate isworthy of further investigation, given the high densityof cannabinoid receptors in the subicular complex andCA1 regions,
15and evidence suggesting glutamatergicdysregulation to be a driver of subicular and CA1 vol-ume changes associated with psychosis.
72,73The dif-ferential pattern of volume change observed acrossleft and right hippocampi is also of interest. While

 the majority of studies examining cannabis-relatedhippocampal pathophysiology which have reportedhemispheric lateralization effects found volume re-duction to be more pronounced in the right hip-pocampus,
10,80,81inverse associations between lefthippocampal volume and cannabis exposure (e.g.,cumulative use

Mechanisms for hemispheric differ-entiation remain unclear, and future research shouldseek to examine potential lateralization effects inCBD treatment response.In conclusion, our ﬁndings are the ﬁrst to demon-strate an ameliorating effect of CBD treatment uponbrain structural harms characteristic of regular can-nabis use. Furthermore, these results speak to the po-tential for CBD treatment to restore hippocampalpathology in a range of clinical populations (e.g.,schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, and major de-pressive disorder).

Fifth Contemporary Drug Problems Conference   The 2019 Fifth Contemporary Drug Problems Conference at the Monash University Prato Centre in Italy was themed ‘Rethinking ‘change’: New theories, new topics, new questions, new methods’. The conference sought to present research from range of social science disciples that re-imagine the notion and focus of ‘change’ in relation to drugs. MARC member A/Prof Kate Seear (Faculty of Law) gave the opening keynote presentation which was titled “On law’s fragility, onto-advocacy and the possibility of change”. The presentation was based on A/Professor Seear’s recent ARC DECRA fellowship, which explored how ‘addiction’ was dealt with across multiple areas of law, and how it was conceptualised and enacted by lawyers and decision makers such as judges. The presentation drew upon data collected for that study. Shedding light on how ideas about addiction are shaped by lawyers (through their advocacy) and decision makers, the presentation highlighted the importance of connections, stereotypes, assumptions, emotions and anticipation in the production of legal content and legal ‘truths’ about drugs. A/Prof Seear argued that lawyers might consider deliberately leveraging law’s ontological fragility, and rethinking their advocacy practices in light of the power they hold to constitute objects, subjects and outcomes. The Contemporary Drug Problems conference also featured a presentation from MARC member Dr Michael Savic (Turning Point). Dr Savic’s presentation was entitled “Producing care and change through pauses, waiting and silences in online alcohol and other drug counselling encounters”.  This presentation reported on early findings from a project to explore client and counsellor experiences of online counselling. The project was funded through the Monash University Arts-Medicine Interdisciplinary Seed Funding Research Scheme and involved several Monash University researchers, including Dr Narelle Warren, A/Prof Adrian Carter, Dr Kiran Pienaar, A/Prof Victoria Manning, Prof Dan Lubman, Anthony Barnett and Emma Sandral.

Research suggests that up to 80% of people relapse after methamphetamine withdrawal treatment, thus new approaches to improving treatment outcomes are urgently needed. One technique proven effective for people with alcohol use disorders is Approach Bias Modification (ABM), a computerised training task which aims to reduce automatic (subconscious) responding to alcohol cues that lead to craving and subsequent consumption.  The team: Dr Victoria Manning, Dr Joshua Garfield and Mr Hugh Piercy A/Prof Vic Manning and her team received funding from Eastern Health Foundation to examine the feasibility, acceptability and outcomes of ABM delivered during inpatient methamphetamine withdrawal. 47 inpatients recruited from 3 withdrawal units in Melbourne underwent four consecutive days of training. Using a joystick they were trained to push away (avoid) images of methamphetamine and pull towards them (approach) images of fruit and vegetables and completed follow-ups assessing treatment outcomes two-weeks and three months post-discharge. Acceptability of the training was high, with 75-78% agreeing that it improved their attention and was interesting, and only 4 withdraw due to the methamphetamine images triggering craving. Encouragingly 61% reported no methamphetamine use during the first two weeks following discharge and 54% reported abstinence at the 3-month follow-up which is substantially higher than the 18% observed in a large multi-site treatment outcomes study. The findings, currently in press with the Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment suggest ABM could be beneficial for people seeking treatment for methamphetamine use. The team have been funded by the National Centre for Clinical Research in Emerging Drugs to conduct a RCT to test the efficacy of this low-cost, easily-administered intervention that could help prevent relapse.

Monash Paramedics and Monash Addiction Research Centre featured on ABC’s 7.30 Report  CAPTION: Filming for the 7.30 report with Prof Suzanne Nielsen of the Monash Addiction Research Centre, Prof Brett Williams of the Department of Community Emergency Health and Paramedic Practice, and Paramedic students Natasha, Taylor, Lorna & Victoria. Researchers from the Monash Addiction Research Centre (MARC) A/Prof Suzanne Nielsen and Melissa Middleton conducted a study on changes in prescribing trends for codeine and other commonly prescribed opioids following the up-scheduling of the codeine to prescription only medication. The analyses showed that despite concerns, substitution of over-the-counter codeine with higher strength prescribed codeine was not observed at a population level, nor did a shift to other prescribed opioids appear to occur. The results were presented at the International Medicine in Addiction Conference Melbourne in March 2019, and attracted media interest. This story was also presented by ABC’s the 7.30 Report. This was filmed in Building H on the Peninsula Campus with paramedic students from the Department of Community Emergency Health and Paramedic Practice. You can read more about the story here.
