The promising medicinal benefits of cannabis
",,"On December 15, the Australian Department of Health’s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) announced a final decision to down-schedule certain low-dose cannabidiol (CBD) products, allowing select medicinal cannabis products to be available over the counter. This follows the United Nations’ (UN) decision at the start of December to remove cannabis and its derivatives from Schedule IV of the international treaty governing narcotic drugs, where it was listed among addictive opioids like heroin. With official restrictions around medicinal cannabis slowly relaxing, more Australians may be wondering how it’s different from illicit cannabis and what it’s used to treat. Medicinal cannabis is any cannabis-based product prescribed to relieve the symptoms of a medical condition. When discussing medicinal cannabis, it’s important to understand the two main compounds (cannabinoids) found in cannabis: cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The effects of THC are what the layman may commonly associate with cannabis. It’s a psychoactive compound, meaning it can cause a ‘high’, but it also provides a number of health benefits for some patients.  CBD, on the other hand, is non-psychoactive and actually counteracts the negative effects of THC, reducing memory impairment and paranoia. Either or both of these compounds can be used to create medicinal products in a range of formats, including dried flower, vape concentrate, oil, oral spray or soft gels. Oils may be taken orally or incorporated into a cream, gel or lotion for topical treatment. Medicinal cannabis has been found to be an effective medicine1 for the treatment of a vast range of symptoms, particularly where traditional prescriptions have proven ineffective. THC and CBD have beneficial effects on a patient’s ability to manage symptoms such as pain, anxiety and nausea. In addition to a euphoric high, THC may also impair a patient’s driving ability. A recent Australian study found that CBD does not impair a patient’s ability to drive, while THC can affect driving abilities for up to four hours. For this reason, CBD may be preferable for some patients. THC-containing medicinal products may be used to combat: Meanwhile, CBD-based products can be employed against: While the TGA has down-scheduled CBD-containing products, there are currently no approved medicinal cannabis products on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) that meet the Schedule 3 criteria. As such, patients must still seek a prescription for medicinal CBD products, or any products containing THC. To be prescribed medicinal cannabis, a patient must have a condition diagnosed by a doctor, and have sought traditional treatment methods that resulted in unacceptable adverse side effects and/or no significant efficacy in treating the condition. An eligible patient’s doctor must then submit an SAS-B application to the TGA, supported by clinical justification and relevant medical history. Conditions including anorexia, anxiety, cancer pain, chronic pain, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS) and stress regularly receive approval from the TGA. This means there is a precedent set that applications looking to treat these conditions will have a greater chance of success. Up to November 30 2020, the TGA has approved over 80,000 SAS Category B applications for unapproved medicinal cannabis products.2 Patients seeking access to medicinal cannabis should first talk to their primary healthcare provider or existing medical team about the suitability of medical cannabis for their condition. If a GP is not comfortable prescribing medicinal cannabis, but a patient still wishes to pursue it as a treatment option, Cannatrek Access links patients to qualified independent doctors. These doctors have experience with medicinal cannabis and will help the patient make an informed decision about the suitability of this treatment method. ************ Whilst research into the efficacy and effects of medicinal cannabis for certain treatments is increasing, it is currently in its early days. Patients should always talk to a health professional for advice on their unique requirements before making any decisions about their treatment options.

Exploring medicinal cannabis in endometriosis
",," Endometriosis is a notoriously painful condition affecting more than 11% of Australian women. The condition is characterised by the growth of endometrial tissue (which normally lines the uterus) outside the uterus. Seedings of endometrial tissue can occur in the lining of the pelvis, the abdomen, ovaries, bowel and in uterine muscle (known as adenomiosis). The pain associated with endometriosis often follows a cyclical pattern, in line with a woman’s menstrual cycle. Seedings of tissue can flare up around the time of menstruation, causing pain, which for some is excruciating and debilitating, leaving sufferers bedridden for days. For some women with endometriosis, pain can occur between cycles and/or during intercourse, invading and disrupting important aspects of life. A range of treatment options are currently deployed for endometriosis, including analgesics such as paracetamol, application of heat packs to the site of pain, over-the-counter and prescription anti-inflammatories, and medications that regulate hormonal regulation, such as the oral contraceptive pill, or progestogen-only pill. If these treatments are not successful, options such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn-RH) agonists and antagonists might be used to block the production of estrogen and induce an artificial menopause. Dr Mark Hardy is an addiction medicine specialist with broad experience in treating endometriosis. He explained that while higher-ended treatments can help to control symptoms, they come with increased side effects. “Chemically inducing menopause can result in hot flashes, vaginal dryness and irritability, as well as increasing the risk of osteoporosis,” he said. “Surgical treatments are available for women with a large burden of endometriosis, involving the removal of endometriomas via a laparoscopic procedure. This sees the endometrial tissue removed via a laser or a diathermy blade. This option can have good results, but comes with risks of damaging healthy tissue and causing scar tissue adhesions to areas such as the bowel and fallopian tubes, which can worsen pain and result in other complications. Unfortunately, for some women, the endometriosis comes back, so in certain circumstances a combination of treatments is needed.”  Addiction medicine specialist Dr Mark Hardy has broad experience in treating endometriosis. Interest in medicinal cannabis is growing among Australian doctors and patients — in particular, its ability to treat conditions such as chronic pain. Medicinal cannabis is currently used as an adjunct treatment and management option for refractory chronic pain, a common symptom of endometriosis. Applied Cannabis Research is conducting an observational study through CA Clinics, investigating medicinal cannabis for the treatment of endometriosis. The study aims to recruit 200 women — who will be followed up for 12 months — and will collect safety and efficacy data, as well as track pain and quality-of-life outcomes. The observational study is a sub-study of the CA Clinics Observational Study (CACOS), which aims to collect data on medicinal cannabis for a range of hard-to-treat conditions. “Research shows that women with endometriosis often may wait up to eight years before they receive a diagnosis,” said Louis Williams, CEO of Aruma Labs, which will include its medicinal cannabis products in the study. “During that time, they can suffer debilitating pain, depression and a diminished quality of life. Our aim, through this partnership with Applied Cannabis Research, is to collect patient-reported data to understand whether our unique formulations have potential as a safe and effective treatment option in the ongoing management of the pain that often accompanies endometriosis.” “Chronic pain associated with endometriosis is a complex and debilitating problem for millions of women worldwide,” Dr Hardy added. The positive impacts of medical cannabis on pain are potent enough to consider medical cannabis as a pain-management option, adjunct to current treatments.” Dr Hardy explained that the study will examine different constituents of medicinal cannabis: Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). CBD most likely works via an anti-inflammatory pathway; THC is thought to have a direct effect on pain via cannabinoid receptors in the brain and other parts of the body. “For women with crippling pain caused by endometriosis, cannabinoids could have something to offer, and this is something that we want to find out. Medicinal cannabis is not a panacea, but could have an important role in adjunctive treatment,” he said. “In severe endometriosis, I often see women who have to take large quantities of analgesics just to get through the day. This can lead to tolerance; dependence; problems with the liver, kidneys and stomach; and loss of functional capacity. “Cannabinoids have the advantage of being opioid sparing, with far less chance of overdose compared with opioids.” CA Clinics’ Dr Davina Hiley added, “Many women suffer from distressing endometriosis symptoms. Common treatments such as hormonal therapy, analgesia, anti-inflammatories or even surgical intervention are often ongoing, and have their own set of risks and side effects. There’s therefore a need to consider other therapeutic management options such as medicinal cannabis.” The CACOS endometriosis sub-study will investigate the safety and efficacy of a THC-dominant product, a CBD-dominant product and a balanced THC–CBD product. Optimal dosing and constituent profiles will be assessed over the 12-month follow-up period by monitoring factors such as pain scores, pain interference, sleep patterns and welfare. “At this point we don’t know if any of the cannabinoids will work, but that’s what we want to find out,” Dr Hardy said. “Do patients find that their pain gets better? Are people coping better as a result of taking this medication? What constituents work best and how do they work in combination with other strategies such as hormone treatments or surgery? Having a real-world observational study of this kind will inform us how the treatment behaves in the community and will be very useful in generating data on an area of medicine that is relatively unexplored. We will be hanging out for the results.” Image credit: ©stock.adobe.com/au/Africa Studio","Mar 17, 2021 ...

Medical Cannabis: The Possible Hope For Chronic Pain
",," Sadly, chronic pain is common, with 1 in 5 Australians aged 45 and over experiencing the issue. The condition is classified as persistent pain several times a week that makes daily activities difficult. And when conventional medicines provide little relief or leave patients suffering severe side effects, there are very few other solutions people can turn to. A report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare revealed that people with chronic pain were almost 3 times more likely to be dispensed with analgesics than those without pain. And with growing evidence of the harm and negative side-effects of opioids in managing chronic pain, there is hope that other alternatives exist that don’t resign you to struggling through life with pain. Maybe natural plant-based therapies are what you’re looking for. In 2016, the Australian Government legalised cannabis-based products for medicinal use. It caused a significant shift in the way people viewed the plant. Although in our modern society, it’s been generally associated with recreational drug use and getting ‘high’, our ancestors have a different story to tell. Cannabis was an ancient plant whose healing properties have been known for thousands of years by the ancient cultures of China, Italy, India and Greece. The alleged first recorded use was as far back as 2800 BC by Emperor Shen Nung (reputed to be the father of Chinese medicine). Since many countries have now begun to legalise the use of medicinal cannabis, there is a growing demand for clinical trials, research and evidence to educate on the plant’s possible benefits in medicine. A recent monumental placebo-controlled trial published by the renowned New England Journal of Medicine showed evidence that CBD decreased the seizures in otherwise drug-resistant childhood epilepsy. It’s a study where 120 children and young adults received an oral dosage of cannabidiol solution over a 14-week treatment period. It was concluded that the cannabidiol treatment delivered a greater reduction in seizures than the placebo, with higher adverse events. In 2016, the USA National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine published a comprehensive review of the current state of evidence in regards to the use of cannabis for health. They concluded that there was already considerable evidence to support cannabinoid use in the treatment of: While the same review also demonstrated moderate evidence to support the use of cannabinoids in improving the sleep quality of people with specific diseases like chronic pain. The University of Sydney is a leading research team and is committed to expanding the amount of evidence supporting the plant’s use in medicine. Their current clinical trials focus on the use of medical cannabis in a diverse range of areas, such as chronic pain, PTSD and sleep. It’s always worth keeping an eye on their work for exciting updates on the health benefits of the plant. Keep in mind that research on medicinal cannabis is still evolving and ongoing. Patients should always consult with a health professional before making any decisions about treatment options.

Medical cannabis: much work to be done
",," Over 90% of Australians support the legalisation of medical use cannabis but out of 38,000 GPs in Australia, only a small handful are able to prescribe medicinal cannabis. In the two years since medicinal cannabis was legalised, only 1059 Australians out of more than 24 million have received approved treatment. At the recent ‘The Future of Cannabis’ panel at Advertising Week Sydney, Paul Mavor, Health House International pharmacist, stated that he believes only a handful of GPs in Australia are able to prescribe medicinal cannabis. “All Australian GPs and nurse practitioners can prescribe medical cannabis; however, there is a large amount of paperwork involved so most are reluctant. There is federal and state health department approvals involved in writing a medical cannabis prescription. NSW recently introduced a one-page online smart form which reduced processing times down from two months to within 48 hours — this dramatically improved patient access and has led to a marked increase in prescriber confidence. Victoria and Queensland have just adopted this system and other states are expected to follow suit in the coming months,” he said. “Cannabis is a new treatment option for many and they are understandably cautious in prescribing something new for their patients. We are starting to see a number of prescribers, particularly pain specialists, switch patients from highly addictive pharmaceutical opioids to cannabis-based medicine.” Since the early 1900s, there has existed a culture of misinformation about cannabis. The irony is that in many parts of the world it was actually the preferred medicine of choice by doctors and patients. In fact, when Bayer introduced Aspirin in 1899, cannabis was widely used for pharmaceutical purposes in the USA. When it comes to patient health, medical professionals should always have a grasp of all the tools available. Studies suggest medical cannabis has the potential to play a therapeutic role in several health issues, including paediatric epilepsy, opioid dependence, chronic pain and certain forms of cancer. Doctors need to know when cannabis has the potential to help and the protocols for delivering the maximum amount of benefit with the minimum amount of risk. Ironically, many medical professionals also need to be retrained to undo whatever misinformation they were fed in years past that rarely came from sound clinical research. This summer, BMJ Open published a survey of general practitioners in Australia, and 57% supported availability on prescription, especially for health issues like cancer pain, epilepsy and palliative care. The same study found that most GPs felt their own knowledge was inadequate, and only 29% therefore felt comfortable discussing medicinal cannabis with patients. Whereas some politicians still resist the inevitable global expansion of medical cannabis, the country’s doctors continue to push for more access and training. Likewise, Australia’s Minister for Health Greg Hunt said he wants Australia to become the world’s leading supplier of medical cannabis, which would necessitate more training across a wide spectrum of professions, including medical. A majority of doctors are already on board, so what is needed is for them to be more outspoken about medical cannabis as a viable treatment option. Doctors can truly help destigmatise cannabis by using their credibility to explain the potential benefits and dispel the many untruths that originally gave cannabis a bad name. This expansion of knowledge helps remove the stigma that limits how doctors can best treat their patients. During the recent panel discussions, Sheldon Croome, CEO Atlas Growers, a Canadian medical cannabis and biotechnology company, said, “Practitioners have a unique opportunity to help advance medical science. Not supporting the prescription of medical cannabis means Australian patients are in many cases left with highly addictive pharmaceutical treatments.” Keeping in mind the strict guidelines in place in Australia (and other countries) when it comes to actively advertising medicines to consumers, doctors and healthcare professionals are the only avenue available to educate consumers on the medical cannabis options. People need to be helped, but there is much work to be done in educating those who actually do the work.  *Drake Sutton-Shearer is CEO and founder of PRØHBTD.  Top image credit: ©stock.adobe.com/au/Africa Studio","Aug 30, 2018 ...
