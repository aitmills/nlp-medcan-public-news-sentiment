Here are the arguments,"December 31, 2020 — 6.52am","We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 2 years ago A call to cut more red tape over the prescription of medicinal cannabis that contains THC, to bring WA in line with the eastern states, has been met with varying levels of scepticism by doctors. Late last year, Health Minister Roger Cook announced GPs could prescribe medicinal cannabis instead of specialists, unless it was for children or those at risk of addiction.

And every prescription has to get Therapeutic Goods Administration approval. The TGA approved more than 80,000 applications over the past year, with monthly data showing figures had almost doubled since the end of last year. Before the move to GP approvals in WA, the number of state-approved treatments totalled 876 over three years. That figure was definitely on the rise, according to Subiaco pharmacist and director of the St Francis Group, David Cooper. But he warned that his Subiaco clinic was experiencing a significant backlog and seeing a build-up of patients suffering chronic anxiety, insomnia and pain going to the black market or the eastern states, particularly for medicinal cannabis that contains THC. ""There is a massive black market for [cannabis oil] and it’s readily available and they can buy it within hours,"" he told 6PR’s Gary Adshead on Tuesday. ""Whereas our process does take days to weeks ... and the state health process is too heavy-handed and needs to be released, much like what’s happening on the east coast."" Mr Cooper has called for a review of the WA department’s approvals process, as well as the ability for his pharmacy to compound its own unique cannabis oils using raw ingredients that range from zero to 30 milligrams of THC – the highest class permitted. His bid to compound raw ingredients was rejected on the grounds that it would be deemed manufacturing a prohibited substance. Mr Cooper said WA was out of step with the rest of Australia given Queensland didn’t have the same barriers and was easily prescribing THC-based oils at almost 10 times the volume of WA, despite only having twice the head of population. To ""further rub salt into the wound"", he claimed the health department threatened him with a pharmaceutical audit. ""The West Australian policy is too heavy-handed they’re treating it like an opiate and it just isn’t,"" Mr Cooper said on air. The department has been contacted for comment. The Australian Medical Association’s WA president Andrew Miller rejected Mr Cooper’s call, saying any backlog for THC prescriptions demonstrated that the correct checks and balances were in place. ""THC has not been shown in any clinical trials as being a particularly useful drug,"" he said. ""If they are looking at it from a harm minimisation perspective it needs to be backed with research about why THC is so useful and that’s what drug companies have failed to do. ""Prescription cannabis is not a replacement for the black market and was never intended to be."" GP and medical advisor to Little Green Pharma, Joe Kosterich, disagreed, saying there was plenty of evidence that medicinal cannabis, with varying amounts of the two cannabinoids – CBD and THC – could be helpful for people with post traumatic stress disorder, multiple sclerosis and other chronic illnesses. He said WA had made great progress over the past 12 months and while prescriptions could be better streamlined like those in New South Wales and Queensland, he did not agree with Mr Cooper’s assessment of the WA system. ""As a prescriber, I can say they will turn around applications in two business days,"" Dr Kosterich said. ""Where they do draw a line is dosages above 30 milligrams of THC per day and that’s going to be an issue for some but not most people. ""It’s not a panacea for everybody but it certainly can help."" Dr Kosterich also said there were plenty of ready-made medicinal cannabis products in the local market already that could satisfy patient needs without privately compounding. Mr Cooper remained hopeful of getting an audience with either of the major parties about his issue, however, neither responded to the call. Instead, a new party to Perth’s coming election, the Legalise Cannabis Western Australia Party was more than sympathetic to his cause, with candidate Leo Treasure calling out both parties for failing to lead on the issue. ""The WA public deserves policies as good as those in other states,"" he said. ""[Thousands of] vulnerable people suffering from many different ailments will benefit from efficient production and distribution."" Copyright © 2023","Dec 31, 2020 ...

This was published 8 years ago On a bad day, four-year-old Bethany Edwards sleeps for more than 18 hours, has trouble holding a fork and finds it hard to walk without falling over or bumping into things. Bethany was 18 months old when she was first diagnosed with epilepsy.  Now four, she suffers from night-time seizures and associated speech and learning difficulties.  ""It's a constant struggle,"" said Bethany's mother, Karen Edwards. Parents hold out for medical cannabis trial: Bethany Edwards plays at home with younger sister Lara.Credit: Brendan Esposito As protocols are being drawn up for the clinical trial of medical cannabis to treat children with severe epilepsy, Karen and Brian Edwards are anxiously waiting to see if Bethany will be included when the trial starts next year.  ""[Epilepsy] affects so many aspects of everyday life,"" Mrs Edwards said. ""Even just going on a holiday, we have to stick to major cities so if Bethany does have a seizure, there's a hospital that can deal with that.""  ""Epilepsy affects so many aspects of everyday life.""Credit: Brendan Esposito The clinical trial will be the first of its kind in Australia and part of a handful of similar studies carried out worldwide.  Dr John Lawson, paediatric neurologist at Sydney Children's Hospital and a principal investigator on the trial, said that up to 200 children from as young as six months of age may be included.  Those enrolled will be at the severe end of the epilepsy spectrum, and at least a couple of standard medications will have to have failed to help them.  Mrs Edwards said Bethany's neurologist at The Children's Hospital at Westmead would be putting Bethany's name forward to be included in the trial, but there was no guarantee she would get in.  And if she doesn't? ""I'd be gutted,"" Mrs Edwards said. ""She's four, you feel like you're her voice, you have to fight for them and get them the best."" Some parents have been unable to wait for a trial, sourcing medical marijuana illegally, usually in desperate attempts to ease their children's suffering.  But Dr Lawson said a trial was essential to look at the safety and efficacy of the product.  ""You hear a few commentators, even medical experts, saying we don't need trials, but they're talking about adults. ""We're talking about very young children, we need to know the safety and families are asking for that."" The medicinal cannabis will be in the form of a tincture or edible product.  Unlike street marijuana, which contains high levels of the chemical compound THC, the oil extract used in the trial will have high levels of cannabidiol or CBD, and low levels of THC.  This maximises the anti-seizure potential and decreases the risk of mind-altering psychoactive effects, Dr Lawson said. Mrs Edwards agrees that a trial is necessary to ensure the treatment is safe, but would trade Bethany's seizures and her medication side effects for the main side effects of medical marijuana – fatigue and drowsiness – any day.  ""Every time I give her her medication I feel like I'm poisoning her in a way because I know the side effects.""  Bethany is on an anti-epileptic and a steroid medication, and is already suffering the adverse effects of the steroid, with weight gain, mood changes, insomnia and a weakened immune system.    ""The steroids really affect her ability to cope emotionally, so she'll have a big meltdown and people walk past and you hear, 'She needs a good slap' kind of comments and it's like, 'You don't know what's going on'. ""Just because she's not in a wheelchair … it's a disability that you can't see,"" Mrs Edwards said.    Mrs Edwards hopes medicinal cannabis may control Bethany's seizures to the extent that she could come off her other medications.  But Dr Lawson is cautioning against parents expecting miracle cures.  ""The best estimates at the moment are maybe one-third will benefit and even in those who benefit, it's not necessarily a miracle – their seizures might be reduced,"" he said. For the Edwards, there's a chance the trial could mean a more ""normal"" life for Bethany and a better start at school next year.

Old age had started to catch up with Ellie, the faithful companion of Wollongong resident Paul Lawrence. Paul Lawrence with his 15-year-old staffy Ellie who he claims has benefited from a daily dose of cannabis oil. Credit: Sylvia Liber She was suffering from arthritis and glaucoma, had lost her appetite and was experiencing fitful sleep. For Mr Lawrence, a cancer survivor who two years ago ditched legal painkillers in preference of medicinal cannabis, the remedy was obvious. ""My friends were sceptical but the results were clear. Ellie had been hobbling around, not eating or sleeping, but after starting her on cannabis oil 12 months ago she was back running up and down the backyard, her appetite had returned and she was sleeping much better."" Mr Lawrence said the oil he administers to his beloved pet did not contain the psycho-active compound tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), yet did retain cannabidiol (CBD) which he believed had therapeutic benefits. This month NSW Premier Mike Baird and Minister for Medical Research Pru Goward announced that, in an Australian first, children with severe treatment-resistant epilepsy would be provided with compassionate access to a cannabis-based medicine made of pure CBD. In announcing the scheme at Sydney Children's Hospital on July 5, Ms Goward said the government recognised the potential of such medicines, particularly for people who had exhausted conventional treatment options. ""We have embarked on an ambitious research program to explore the possible therapeutic benefits of cannabinoids for patients suffering from a range of debilitating conditions,"" Ms Goward said. Legal access to medicinal cannabis can not come quick enough for Mr Lawrence.  Diagnosed with a rare spinal tumour in 2010; he had three vertabrae removed during a 43-hour operation. Five of his ribs, a leg bone and 60 pieces of titanium were used to rebuild his spine. Legal painkillers did not curb his chronic pain and caused serious side effects. ""What I'm doing to treat myself for ongoing pain - and my dog - is legal in several countries around the world, but not Australia,"" he said. ""We don't need more research, more trials - we need action. It's great medicinal cannabis is being made available for some kids with severe epilepsy but I don't see much compassion when terminally ill patients and others in chronic pain are not allowed access. It's not about smoking pot and getting stoned - it's about ingesting it to get some pain relief."" In the US, doggie treats containing cannabis compounds are marketed to owners of ailing and elderly animals as pain relievers. However it's important to note that the Australian Veterinary Association does not recommend the administration of cannabis oil to dogs. ""Anyone who is concerned about their older pet should contact their local veterinarian to discuss the best management plan,"" AVA member Paula Parker said. Specifically Dr Parker warned against the use of products containing THC, which she said would be dangerous for pets. ""THC causes a neurological depressant effect in dogs similar to people,"" she said. ""Owing to their smaller body size, this can lead to dangerous levels of depression of heart and lung function, especially where the compound has been concentrated in oil or butter form.  ""Anyone who suspects their pet may have ingested THC in any form should contact their local veterinarian."" Illawarra Mercury Copyright © 2023","Jul 13, 2016 ...

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 3 years ago There is not currently enough evidence to suggest medicinal cannabis has any benefit for treating psychological disorders, a new study has found. Much has been made in recent years of the positive medical effects of cannabis-derived compounds to treat a range of physical and mental ailments. Mature cannabis plants being grown for medicinal use at the facility run by Medifarm on the Sunshine CoastCredit: Stuart Layt However, there has been relatively little actual research done into the effects of cannabinoids when used to treat conditions, especially mental disorders. A review of the available research, covering 83 studies and three thousand people, has found the use of cannabinoids for mental health issues can not currently be justified. ""One of the reasons we did the review is that a very common reason people report using medicinal cannabis is to treat symptoms of these disorders,"" the University of Queensland's Professor Wayne Hall, one of the study’s authors, said. ""There are disorders where there is evidence of benefit, but the great majority of people who are being treated with medicinal cannabis aren’t being treated for those conditions."" In particular, Professor Hall said nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy patients, muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis and seizures caused by a particular type of epilepsy had been shown to be helped by medicinal cannabis. However, every mental condition which advocates claimed to be able to treat using a cannabinoid simply did not have the evidence to support it. Given that, the study’s lead author, Professor Louisa Degenhardt of UNSW Sydney, said there needed to be more investment in full clinical of medicinal cannabis. ""Clinicians and consumers need to be aware of the low quality and quantity of evidence for the effectiveness of medicinal cannabinoids in treating mental health disorders and the potential risk of adverse events,"" Professor Degenhardt said. ""Given the likely interest but scant evidence to guide patient and clinician decisions around cannabinoids for mental health, there is an urgent need for randomised controlled trials to inform whether there are benefits of cannabinoids for these indications."" In particular there was no reason why cannabinoids were not being subjected to the same regulatory approval process as other prescription medications, the report’s authors said. Professor Hall stressed it was possible there were benefits to using cannabinoids to treat mental disorders, but there simply wasn’t enough evidence to back up the claim at this stage. ""There’s been this early and broad generalisation from the fact that it does have some medical uses that it can be used for any medical purpose, which is what is often advocated by some of the more enthusiastic supporters of medical cannabis,"" he said. ""The risk with THC, which is the ingredient which produces the high in cannabis, there’s a real risk to administering something like that to people who already have disturbed mood, anxiety and depression."" Only 40 of the 83 studies examined were the ideal randomised control trials, where the patients were not aware whether they were receiving the drug or not, while in the rest of the trials patients were aware they were being given cannabis products, potentially skewing the results. The authors pointed out the findings related specifically to medicinal cannabis, such as the medically derived extracts THC and CBD, as opposed to recreational use of cannabis, which has a detailed body of evidence suggesting adverse mental effects with prolonged use. The study has been published in the journal The Lancet Psychiatry, as part of The Lancet’s series on drug use more generally. Copyright © 2023","Oct 30, 2019 ...

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 1 year ago The sports doctor who advised Lauren Jackson on using medicinal cannabis as part of her comeback says the star basketballer has a straightforward case for an exemption, and believes cannabis will eventually be removed from anti-doping banned lists because it is not performance enhancing. Dr Peter Brukner, a sports physician and researcher who has worked with leading sides such as the Australian cricket team, the Australian Olympic team, Liverpool FC and several AFL clubs, has spent the past 12 months studying medicinal cannabis before a clinical trial he is running at La Trobe University this year. The trial is researching the effect of cannabis on osteoarthritis knee pain, and will involve many ex-AFL players. The trial is associated with Levin Health, a Melbourne-based medicinal cannabis company that last year formed a sports advisory panel of Jackson, ex-AFL coach Alastair Clarkson and jockey Damien Oliver. Jackson, a Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer who is rated as one of the best female players in history, has been taking medicinal cannabis since last year to treat chronic knee pain, which led to her retirement in 2016. Jackson has found great relief from the treatment, so much so she began contemplating a return to the court for home town team Albury Wodonga Bandits in the second-tier NBL1 East. But given almost all cannabis products are on the World Anti-Doping Agency list of substances prohibited in competition - and can attract lengthy suspensions - the 40-year said her comeback would hinge on getting a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE). Lauren Jackson playing for the Seattle Storm in 2010.Credit: Getty “If it is prescribed by a doctor under the appropriate process, there is a particular medicinal access scheme in Australia that you have to go through, if it is under that scheme, they will issue a TUE,” Brukner said. “Lauren was concerned that she may not be able to continue taking the cannabis if she goes back. I have reassured her that is not the case.” The need for athletes to seek TUEs for medicinal cannabis may be a moot point in the near future, Brukner believes. Debate has raged for years about whether cannabis is performance enhancing and belongs on WADA’s prohibited substances list. In 2012, the Coalition of Major and Professional Sports, which represents the AFL, NRL, Rugby Australia, Cricket Australia and Tennis Australia, argued that WADA should remove cannabis from the banned list. In 2018, WADA removed cannabidiol, which is more commonly referred to as CBD and is the non-psychoactive, pain-relieving cannabinoid found in cannabis, from its prohibited list. Team doctor Peter Brukner speaks to Australian batsman Matt Renshaw during a series against Pakistan in 2017.Credit: Getty Images Last year, US sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson was prevented from running in the Tokyo Olympics after testing positive to cannabis. After an outpouring of sympathy for the runner, WADA announced it would respond to feedback from “a number of stakeholders” and review cannabis’ status on the prohibited list in 2022. “There is no performance enhancement. The reason cannabis is on the banned list is not because of performance enhancement, it is because of legality issues and they didn’t want to encourage [athletes] to take it,” Brukner said. “Arguably it is performance limiting. There has never been any evidence it is performance enhancing. “I think it will come off soon. There are moves to review it and it probably should have never been on it. It probably affects a sport’s business more, whether people take cannabis or not. It is just one of those things, they put all those illegal, antisocial drugs on the list. “But the use of cannabis has become more and more widespread, it is legal in half the states of America.” Brukner said if trials confirmed medicinal cannabis was an effective source of pain relief for athletes, there would be no reason why active sportsmen and sportswomen could not use it as part of regular treatment.

Researchers from the Queensland University of Technology conducted a wide-ranging review of 26 published studies across Australia, the United States, Canada and Ireland. Health professionals support medicinal cannabis as a treatment option but many don't know enough about it.Credit: Alamy QUT pharmacy PhD candidate Kyle Gardiner led the analysis and said the main theme running through all the studies was that medical professionals broadly supported the idea of medicinal cannabis but lacked information about it. “Health professionals support medicinal cannabis but that support is sometimes offset by their concerns,” Mr Gardiner said. “Although they might feel it has a place in therapy, they also don’t have a clear idea about where it fits.” In particular, a major concern among many of the health professionals surveyed was the psychiatric effect of medicinal cannabis, which it was felt had not been researched thoroughly enough. In nearly every jurisdiction where medicinal cannabis is legal, at least one medical professional is required to sign off for a person to access it. “There’s a big difference between being supportive of medicinal cannabis and actually delivering medicinal cannabis on the ground,” Mr Gardiner said. “There’s still a lot we don’t know about medicinal cannabis ... when it comes to the pharmacology, what does it do on a molecular level and how does it affect things like chronic pain or symptoms of MS [multiple sclerosis]?” Mr Gardiner stressed the study - supervised by Professor Lisa Nissen, Head of QUT’s Faculty of Health School of Clinical Sciences - wasn’t about the benefits of medicinal cannabis itself, but how medical professionals reacted to the emerging treatment. “It puts health professionals in quite a tricky position, because if you don’t have a good understanding of a drug, how best do you move forward from a clinical perspective?” he said. The Queensland government last month passed laws making it easier for doctors and patients to access medicinal cannabis, after initially making it legal in 2015. Under the new changes, medicinal cannabis is treated the same as other drugs of addiction or prescription drugs. In welcoming the new laws, Health Minister Steven Miles said medicinal cannabis had “great potential” as a treatment and an industry. “There are several companies working towards having medicinal cannabis products produced locally in Queensland,” he said. “I look forward to following their progress in taking their products to market. This will help improve access for people and reduce costs for these increasingly important medicines.” Importantly, despite the changes for medicinal cannabis it remained illegal for the Queensland public to grow cannabis for medical purposes. The study found overall there was a growing acceptance of medicinal cannabis as a treatment option in newer studies compared to older ones. It also found overall specialist practitioners were more likely to be supportive of medicinal cannabis as a treatment option than health professionals in general or community practice. The findings have been published this week in the journal PLOS One. Copyright © 2023","May 11, 2019 ...

The symposium will host a range of Australian and overseas health and legal experts to discuss the merits of the treatment. Earlier this year, Nationals MP for Tamworth Kevin Anderson drafted a private members bill to allow terminally ill patients to use cannabis.  Mr Baird later announced the NSW government would run clinical trials of the drug. The trial will be devised by a working party that will report back to the government by the end of the year. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has thrown his support behind the planned trial. Mr Baird has also said the existing police discretion to not charge terminally ill adults if they are caught using cannabis for pain relief would be formalised through new guidelines. He said the clinical trial would ""explore further the role cannabis can play in providing relief for patients suffering from a range of debilitating or terminal illnesses"". Last year, a NSW Upper House Inquiry recommended the state government approve use of cannabis for those suffering from chronic pain and amend the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act to add a defence to cover the authorised use. Health Minister Jillian Skinner indicated she would not support the recommendation but wrote to the federal government asking for further clinical research on the issue.

Trials will begin in Queensland of medicinal cannabis.  The premier said she discussed the trials with her NSW counterpart Mike Baird on Friday during the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) meeting in Canberra. ""This trial is about letting the experts do as much research as possible into this issue so that we can all get a clearer understanding of any clinical benefits medicinal cannabis can provide,"" Ms Palaszczuk said.

Health Minister Steven Miles on Tuesday introduced a bill to repeal the Public Health (Medicinal Cannabis) Act 2016, and make other reforms. Health Minister Steven Miles has announced the government will repeal its medicinal cannabis laws to allow a more streamlined process.Credit: Gary Malerba Under the changes, specialists would be able to prescribe medicinal cannabis to patients the same as other controlled or restricted medicine, such as codeine. Mr Miles said the change would significantly streamline the prescription process by removing state-level approval, with the federal Therapeutic Goods Administration to be responsible for the prescription process. ""It will remove red tape for patients and doctors seeking access to medicinal cannabis treatment,"" he said. ""It will also mean that visitors to Queensland who have a valid prescription for medicinal cannabis from another jurisdiction will no longer require a specific Queensland approval."" In 2016, the Queensland government passed legislation to allow doctors to prescribe medicinal cannabis to patients, at a time when the drug was a schedule 9 prohibited substance. Later that year, the federal Therapeutic Goods Administration rescheduled botanical cannabis products and botanically derived cannabis extracts as schedule 8. Mr Miles said it now made sense to allow a nationally consistent approach. ""Repealing the Act [in Queensland] will ensure there is no unnecessary duplication with Commonwealth requirements,"" he said. The bill also removes the requirement for pharmacists to hold an approval to dispense medicinal cannabis and researchers to hold an approval to conduct a clinical trial. It would remain illegal for the Queensland public to grow cannabis for medical purposes. Last month, there were 329 applications from across Australia for unapproved medicinal cannabis accepted by the TGA, up from 60 in January. Patients have had medicinal cannabis approved to treat symptoms of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, uncontrolled epilepsy in children and anorexia associated with chronic illness. The bill would also dorce companies or people responsible for pollution to take responsibility for notifying the public of health risks. Its introduction came after spills of toxic firefighting foam in recent years led to questions about which authorities were responsible for notifying the public. The bill would also establish an occupational dust lung disease register, fulfilling recommendations from the Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis Select Committee's Black Lung, White Lies report. It proposes a compulsory notification regime for occupational dust lung disease and require annual reports to Parliament with the number of cases reported. In September, it was revealed WorkCover Queensland had received 22 compensation claims for compensation for silicosis from workers in the engineered stone benchtop industry in just three weeks. If passed, the legislation would allow body parts used at a school of anatomy to be lawfully cremated without a corresponding death certificate or the approval of an independent doctor. The bill will be debated in 2019. Copyright © 2023","Nov 13, 2018 ...

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 5 years ago Australia's cumbersome application system makes it difficult for patients  to access medicinal cannabis.  For the vast majority of Australian patients, medicinal cannabis is little more than a pipe dream and part of the problem lies with the all-too-conservative approach  that relies on specialist doctors. Those seeking medicinal cannabis in Australia must navigate a cumbersome application process, which requires going to a specialist physician not a GP. The result is that patients either go without or continue to use illicitly sourced products of unknown composition and safety. Seeing a specialist generally involves long waiting times and significant expense - and should you visit one seeking a green light for cannabis, thanks to recent government announcements, you will be most likely disappointed; they tend not to have been educated in the area of cannabis medicine and may well be skeptical and uncertain how to proceed. A new ""perspective piece"" by the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, published in the current issue of the Medical Journal of Australia, is unlikely to improve this situation. Rather than providing a coherent and balanced account of the current state of play, the “perspective” reads like a patronising and scaremongering diatribe, misrepresenting the literature to frighten off would-be prescribers. The RACP represents 25,000 specialists across Australasia and in 2016 formed a Medicinal Cannabis Reference Group to develop a position on the issue, this “perspective” piece being the Group’s first public output. Most egregious of its falsehoods is the statement that medicinal cannabis is no better than placebo in treating pain. Oddly, when asserting this claim, the published piece cites two authoritative recent reviews from the US - reviews that in fact concluded the opposite. This misrepresentation is no trivial issue. Some 20 per cent of Australians suffer chronic pain and surveys shows self-medication for back pain, arthritis and neuropathic pain are major drivers of illicit cannabis use in the Australian community. Those in unremitting pain are precisely the people who need their specialist doctors to have a nuanced and accurate knowledge of cannabinoid science. The perspective piece stokes concerns about increased cannabis-related hospital presentations in parts of the US that have legalised cannabis. What isn’t mentioned is that this largely reflects children consuming their parents’ cannabis recreational “edibles” like cannabis-infused chocolates. Also neglected is the fact that in parts of the US where medicinal cannabis is available, there has been a 25 per cent reduction in deaths due to prescription opioids, as well as a reduction in use of prescription drugs such as benzodiazepines and antidepressants. Deaths due to prescription opioids have declined in states where medicinal marijuana is available in the US.Credit: AP Cannabis is a drug that is used by more than 100 million people every year, none of whom die as a result. In contrast, prescription opioids alone resulted in the deaths of more than 40,000 Americans in 2016. The RACP perspective also cites the “known addictive” properties of cannabis. However, addiction specialists generally concede that cannabis is far less addictive than opioids and benzodiazepines. Even steroids and antidepressants have withdrawal effects during sudden discontinuation and these issues are routinely managed in clinical practice. Part of the complexity in the underlying science is that cannabis is actually hundreds of potential new medicines. THC is the psychoactive ingredient but there are hundreds of other bioactive molecules in the plant with potential therapeutic effects that do not intoxicate. One of these is cannabidiol (CBD), which the World Health Organisation recently concluded poses few risks to health and its use should not be restricted by governments - again, this critical development is not mentioned in the “perspective” piece. The RACP instead chooses to focus on reports of potential side effects of CBD in children given extremely large doses of CBD to treat severe epilepsy, which can be a life-threatening condition. We also know that these parents tend to turn to cannabis as a last resort, and the results can be positively transformative. The RACP perspective offers no empathy for the estimated 100,000-plus Australians self-medicating with illicit medicinal cannabis and it proposes no solution for bringing them into mainstream medicine, as has been achieved in Canada, Israel and the Netherlands. The RACP talks of a “precautionary principle” and “do no harm” - but in misrepresenting the facts of medicinal cannabis it promulgates a great deal of harm. Our own recent work with GPs suggests many would like to be able to prescribe, given sufficient training, and that they feel disenfranchised by the specialist-only system. Rumblings from Canberra - that regime change might indeed bring GPs into a new system where they act as medicinal cannabis gatekeepers - could be just what the doctor ordered. After all, if GPs are entrusted to prescribe opiates and benzodiazepines, why not medicinal cannabis products?

This was published 5 years ago A world-first trial has received federal funding and within a matter of months, Queensland researchers hope to start investigating the symptom relief medicinal cannabis can provide to cancer patients receiving palliative care. The trial will test several combinations of medicinal cannabinoids, natural products of the cannabis plant, to see which symptoms can be targeted and which variety of cannabinoids provides the most effective relief for just more than 200 terminally ill south-east Queensland patients. The Mater Research Institute and University of Queensland are leading a world-first medicinal cannabis trial, set to begin later this year.

""This is the first trial with a holistic patient approach, trying to address all of the symptoms to see if we can reduce the burden,"" Professor Hardy said. The two types of cannabinoids to be trialled were tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC gives users ""the high"" and CBD is most beneficial as an anti-inflammatory, according to Professor Hardy. The trial will test different combinations and doses of the two cannabinoids to determine which mixture achieves the most effective pain relief and ""feel-good"" factor.

Perth-based medicinal marijuana company MMJ PhytoTech is on the rise. Epilepsy Association of Western Australia chief executive Suresh Rajan said the news was good for the WA economy and for sufferers of epilepsy, which he said was the state's most common serious neurological condition, affecting one per cent of the population.

""They think you have a seizure and you move on. ""But many people are having up to 500 seizures a day. They just move from one to the next to the next.

""If we can reduce that cost to both the economy and to families, this will be worthwhile,"" he said. Many Australians already use cannabis medicinally, albeit illegally, especially for chronic pain.Credit: Max Mason-Hubers Perth-based MMJ PhytoTech, which made its ASX debut in January, is poised to enter the Australian market as an organisation which is able to grow, extract, refine and supply medicinal cannabis in pharmaceutical grade forms for controlled delivery. An ASX announcement in October announced the company's intention to enter the local market after the federal government said it was considering the legislation. Spokesman Gaelan Bloomfield said the company had since then appointed leading Australian law firm Piper Alderman to act as legal counsel on this entrance. He said it looked as if the Australian system could be very similar to the Canadian system in terms of its licensing scheme, a market where MMJ PhytoTech was already engaged. MMJ PhytoTech already has operations in British Columbia, Canada and is currently selling its products in Europe. ""We know the Canadian licensing system so we are very well positioned to be on the front foot as Australian regulation evolves,"" he said. ""The Canadian system is by far the most well structured regulatory system for medicinal cannabis [globally]. ""As a company we support any regulatory reform in this area and we're encouraged by these discussions at a federal level. ""This regulation is going to provide people with access to medicine that could dramatically improve their quality of life. ""As someone who has met with people who suffer from drug resistant epilepsy and MS I know that access to these medicines has the potential to improve their quality of life. We support any regulatory reform that will allow this to happen."" The federal government had previously planned to introduce a law before the end of this year to allow the states and territories to licence growers in their own jurisdictions, but the Minister changed her mind after consultations with governments and law enforcement agencies showed some states were waiting on a federal regulatory scheme. ""I am confident creating one single, nationally-consistent cultivation scheme, rather than eight individual arrangements, will not only help speed up the legislative process, but ultimately access to medicinal cannabis products as well,"" Health Minister Sussan Ley said. It is unclear whether the scheme will attract enough support in the Senate, as it still differs significantly from the Greens' model to create a new national regulator that would oversee the growth, manufacture and distribution of medicinal cannabis.

This was published 4 years ago Marina Spence and daughter Mikayla Marina Spence has finally found a solution for her daughter Mikayla's debilitating epilepsy - she's just not sure how her family can sustain it. ""You've tried everything else and nothing else has worked,"" the Rossmoyne mother said. Mikayla, 13, suffers from a rare disorder that causes multiple seizures each and every day... but medicinal cannabis has changed her life. ""She has a rare and complex neurological disorder and seizures are a very big part of that,"" Ms Spence said during an emotional interview with Gareth Parker on Radio 6PR's Mornings program. ""Another big challenge she faces from this condition is neurological irritability, which means she feels a lot of discomfort and sensory overload. ""Those two challenges present consequences that impact her every day life. ""So, when she's having seizures, it affects her cognition, her ability to concentrate, to learn, to communicate, and the irritability means she is feeling pain and discomfort pretty much a lot of the time. ""A typical day is a cycle between having seizure clusters,  a little bit of calm and some irritability. ""On her worst days, which can extend out to months and months, she can cycle essentially from one to the other. ""So she can go from a high period of irritability - screaming, banging her head, trying to get the pain out - where everything that she does is uncomfortable. ""You can't touch her, you can't look at her ... noise, crowds, people around her ... it drives her crazy basically... and she just needs to be alone and in a quiet dark place. ""Then she'll go completely quiet, and the quiet means she's in a seizure... and so that essentially can happen all day, every day, so you can imagine the impact on her quality of life, having to endure that going on inside her head. ""You can imagine what people think when they see her as well, and quite often there are situations where she's been labelled as having bad behaviour because of the way her condition manifests, so it's quite humiliating to have that go on."" Medicinal cannabis will be dispensed to children in Victoria with severe epilepsy. Regular family life just can't exist for the Spences ... reading books, watching movies, opening Christmas presents, family weddings, picnics... they basically cannot do if Mikayla is going through a particularly difficult time. ""The impact for her brother [aged 14] and his quality of life has been profound as well and as a family unit if you can't do those basic and essential things that bond a family together, of course it's going to have an effect,"" Ms Spence said. ""Our family bond has suffered and you can understand why families in situations like ours can end up breaking down because the pressure is so great."" Effective treatments for Mikayla's epilepsy were non-existent before the medicinal cannabis road opened for the Spence family. ""In 13 years we have tried pretty much everything,"" she said. ""Essentially we were getting a whole bunch of side effects without much benefit. ""So that's why parents like myself will look to something because you've tried everything else and nothing else has worked."" Ms Spence convinced Mikayla's neurologist to submit an application to the Therapeutic Goods Administration for special access to MC, with a panel in Canberra determining whether the young teenager was worthy of access to the drug. ""It took several months to receive approval ... Mikayla's neurologist did infer it would be expensive, but I didn't have any idea of how expensive until I put the script into the pharmacy and was committed to buying it."" Only one supplier in Perth sells MC in oil form that contains no THC - the marijuana component that gives cannabis smokers a high - and 100 per cent CBD, the hemp part that provides health benefits to epilepsy sufferers like Mikayla. Her family ordered three 25ml bottles initially and were hit with a $533 charge... per bottle, which usually lasted only six days - or $30,000 each year for the Spences to help their girl. After starting ""low and slow"" with dosage levels for Mikayla, the effects were markedly more positive after a higher amount was administered. It left the Spences with no choice but to continue down the expensive road so their daughter - and family as a whole - could live each day as close to a ""normal life"". ""She's been on it now for about four weeks ... as we increased the dose I could see an immediate change,"" Ms Spence said. ""She is still having some seizures but they have definitely reduced. ""What is happening now is, the time between her seizure cycles, she is a completely different person. ""It has helped with the severe irritability ... so she's no longer screaming, no longer trying to bang her head on her arms or legs or whatever she can reach. ""Her cognition has improved significantly, so she can focus, concentrate, read books, look at things, respond to your voice in a really timely manner ... there's no huge delay like there was before. Mikayla has also been able to communicate more effectively with those around her, something that was blocked to her before. ""This is key to someone who can't speak using words,"" her mum said. ""It means they can make themselves understood ... and I can see her personality, her cheeky nature. ""She's actually enjoying herself, which she wasn't before, so her quality of life has been significantly improved."" Family life had also become much more happier in the Spence household. ""There's calm, everyone's relaxed, we can actually talk to each other, actually sit around the table and eat together... as opposed to us eating together and Mikayla eating somewhere else separately,"" Ms Spence said. Given the current high costs of approved medicinal cannabis products in Australia, are they still a realistic option for an ongoing treatment program, especially for young people like Mikayla? ""Absolutely not,"" Ms Spence lamented. ""And that's the dilemma. ""I had to try it because nothing else worked and we were desperate, and now we're in the situation where I'm thinking 'oh my gosh, it has had a significant impact, how on earth am I going to continue to pay for this'. ""And how can I actually let her go back to her life before this.""  Adult concoctions of medicinal cannabis are generally cheaper, as they contain some THC and require less processing to break down the marijuana components. There are also more suppliers of these types of strains in Perth. Dr Joe Kosterich, a medical advisor for Little Green Pharma, the Perth-based medicinal cannabis company awarded the first licence to grow and produce the product in WA, said prospective patients were realistically years from having cheaper access to MC. Dr Joe Kosterich is an advocate for using medicinal cannabis to treat certain patients. Those were generally epilepsy sufferers like Mikayla, chemotherapy patients who endure nausea and vomiting, or those with multiple sclerosis or chronic pain. ""We need more access ... the bigger the market, the more companies and competition we will have, and that will drive prices down,"" Dr Kosterich told WAtoday. ""It's not even an approved product yet, so each application requires TGA approval. ""To get on the PBS (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme), you then need a number of placebo-controlled trials in each area [MS, epilepsy, chronic pain and chemotherapy patients).""

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 1 year ago A 65-year-old man from Perth’s working-class suburbs faces losing the modest home that is his only retirement asset under Western Australia’s extreme and outdated ‘proceeds of crime’ confiscation laws. Kenneth Williams bought his house in the south-eastern suburbs 21 years ago and was paying it off legitimately, well before his crime of growing five cannabis plants in his shed. The mature plants were to make cannabis butter for what he says was medical reasons. Kenneth Williams, pictured, and his Camillo home seized under criminal confiscation laws. The state has not acted on a former chief justice’s 2019 recommendation to overhaul the archaic laws now out of step with the rest of the nation, something prominent lawyer Tom Percy recently labelled “one of the most disgraceful things that the McGowan government hasn’t done”. WAtoday can reveal that according to the Auditor General, police and prosecutors have targets to seize large numbers of ‘proceeds of crime’ assets annually with potential bonuses for exceeding them. The Department of Justice, however, denies there are targets. Mr Williams claimed the plants police found in 2016 were for butter to manage side effects from medication for Hepatitis C, and eight small cuttings were to pay back the grower who lent him the set-up. “It was going to be something that I could just put in the fridge,” Mr Williams told WAtoday. “I [wouldn’t] have to worry about chasing people to get marijuana off them.” Mr Williams admitted to police that he had grown cannabis in his shed and given some away, which led him to pleading guilty to one count of cultivating a prohibited plant with intent to sell or supply in 2017. An Armadale magistrate fined him $3500 and $169 in court costs. Mr Williams says he was unaware of the potential consequences of admitting to an offence that fell under the Criminal Property Confiscation Act. “Here I am making one bloody mistake, and I’m getting crucified for that,” Mr Williams said. “I’m just easy prey.” His house has been held under a freeze order for the past six years as he tried to fight for it in the Supreme Court. According to Department of Public Prosecutions guidelines it decides whether to proceed with or settle such disputes based on the likely profits and prospects of success. The state stands to gain $250,000 from Mr Williams’ house, since he only owes about $70,000 on the mortgage. It proceeded despite numerous medical letters attesting to his incurable condition. Legal medicinal cannabis sales from WA company Little Green Pharma began in late 2018. In a sworn statement to the Supreme Court in the same year, in a bid to keep his house, Mr Williams said he underwent intensive treatment for Hepatitis C and liver disease from 2012 to 2014 with an antiviral drug with severe side effects (now superseded by better treatments). “I was nauseous all the time, lost weight and my hair thinned out,” he told the court. He also had depression and anxiety, at times contemplating taking his own life. Then friends introduced him to cannabis butter. “The benefits were immediate: I was able to relax, communicate better, my nausea subsided, and I felt less aggressive and depressed,” he told the court. He said his doctor advised him to continue with the cookies as his physical and mental health improved. He was able to return to work intermittently. But after an attempt to stop using cannabis left him “all mangled up again,” he borrowed his source’s grower’s hydroponic set-up in October 2015 and grew five 1-metre plants in his shed. Police swooped in January 2016 after a Crime Stoppers tip-off. In a letter to Mr William’s lawyer Anna Trewarn, the prosecutor said property confiscation was appropriate. “Your client made admissions to police at the time of the search that he had four crops to date and that he was supplying one person and receiving $5000 per supply, [and] admitted that he had begun cultivating cannabis because of financial pressures,” the letter said. “The [DPP] does not accept that this was not a serious offence for which confiscation was not appropriate. “Your client’s medical condition appears to have been under control for some time now.” But Mr Williams told the court in 2018 this was his first and only attempt at growing cannabis. He had not intended to sell it but would have given some away to friends. He said he was offered $5000 but refused as he needed the majority for himself. Ms Trewarn argued that Mr Williams was reaching retirement age and the confiscation of a house not bought with illegal proceeds, for offending limited in duration and personal gain, far exceeded the bounds of “general deterrence principles”. But the law’s mandatory parameters meant the court had little choice but to deem the house “crime-used” and seize it last November. The state then sent him a $10,000 bill for court costs. The ruling has left Mr Williams broke. His income of $600 a week is just above the poverty line of $457 per week set by the Australian Council of Social Services. He has only $30,000 in superannuation after working intermittently for the past decade due to his frail health. “My house was my super – that was what I planned for, but really I’ve got nothing,” he said. Mr Williams has another 12 months in the house, after which he can try to appeal the decision to seize it. The year Mr Williams was raided, WA Police had a target to confiscate $12 million worth of ‘proceeds of crime’ assets and the Department of Public Prosecutions a target of $9 million, according to the 2018 Auditor-General’s report. The report into criminal confiscation said the department and police could get bonuses for beating these targets. Funding agreements with the Department of Justice meant the DPP received $4.2 million of the $9.2 million successfully confiscated that year, while police got $1.75 million. A justice department spokesman said the primary purpose of the confiscation process was to disrupt crime. He said the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions made orders to confiscate assets under the Act. Under Department of Justice funding arrangements, top-up payments could be made to the DPP or to police to pursue that objective. These payments were subject to the same conditions and acquittal requirements as annual funding. He said there were several years recorded where the funding level was not met by either agency. Former chief justice Wayne Martin’s review of the decades-old Criminal Property Confiscation Act been acted upon after its completion in 2019 criticised the law and recommended a complete overhaul due to the lack of provision for a court’s discretion over freezing or confiscation orders on the basis of hardship, unfairness or injustice.

Ana Maria GazmuriCredit: @AnaMariaGazmuri Gazmuri told WAtoday although the use of medicinal cannabis was been legalised in WA, there remains a challenge to educate the wider public about its benefits as it becomes a part of society. ""In Chile, educating the community on the benefits of medicinal cannabis has been key to normalising its use and clearing prejudices installed by decades of prohibition,"" she said. ""Training doctors and facilitating access to patients is also paramount as this allowed us to develop excellent results, which we could share quickly via testimonies in the media. ""Australia should invest in more doctor training and easier access for patients. We have successfully treated many patients in Chile who have really benefited from these safe, effective and inexpensive medicines. ""The acceptance of medicinal cannabis was absolutely driven by social attitude, and now medicine is catching up."" Zelda Therapeutics and Gazmuri's Daya Foundation ran an observational autism trial which they claimed had success using medicinal cannabis extracts to treat the core symptoms of autism - clinical trials are expected to commence later this year. Speaking about the overall medicinal cannabis sector, Gazmuri said patients in Chile are seeing beneficial changes and that when supplies become readily available in Australia the difference will be apparent. ""Already patients are using cannabis in place of more dangerous drugs such as opiates and tranquilizers. This is a win for patients and the country as it is a far safer solution,"" she said. ""Medicinal cannabis has had a great impact, especially in paediatric patients with neurological pathologies, such as epilepsy and autism, and in patients with chronic pain.

This was published 5 years ago Every year several new drugs become available in the Australian market, some with great fanfare, others that quietly slide in. There is an assessment process to bring pharmaceuticals to market that show they are safe, they work and side effects are acceptable. To get a listing on the Pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS), and thus attract a government subsidy, the manufacturer must show the costs justify the benefits. Last week a study showed a particular medication has clinical benefit in treating childhood epilepsy and reducing seizures.

You might think doctors, patients and governments would welcome such a product. They would, of course, except for one tiny problem; the name of the product - medicinal cannabis. It is at this point the scientific principals that normally apply are thrown out the window. Companies like Ecofiber still have many hoops to jump through before it can supply medicinal cannabis to prescribed patients.Credit: Max Mason-Hubers WA premier Mark McGowan recently urged doctors to register to prescribe medicinal cannabis in WA as none had done so. A cursory glance at what hoops and forms doctors must deal with before being allowed to prescribe medicinal cannabis might explain their apparent ""reluctance"". Lets get three things clear at the start: Medicinal cannabis is not a cure for all conditions, as some of the more zealous supporters claim. It is also not a dangerous addictive drug as zealous opponents claim. And there is scientific research to support its use. However there is much difficulty doing the necessary trials on an illegal product. Medical Cannabis Research Australia is currently supporting a number of trials. Cannabis is an old plant prescribed legally for medicinal purposes in Australia until 1938.  Canada has nearly 20 years experience prescribing medicinal cannabis and provides a wealth of relevant information for the public and health professionals to digest on its health Canada website. As a historical aside, the situation in Canada came about when its courts ruled the federal government must provide reasonable access to a legal source of cannabis for medicinal purposes. In Australia, our federal government passed legislation to allow the use of medicinal cannabis and the states have also passed supporting legislation. But there is no requirement for the government to provide reasonable access. Realistically all the government needs to do is remove some of the barriers. Cannabis is an old plant. Before being banned, it was prescribed legally for medicinal purposes until 1936 in the United States and 1938 in Australia. Forerunners to three of today's biggest pharmaceutical companies sold medicinal cannabis products. Taken orally rather than smoked, medicinal cannabis doses (like all medications) are controlled. The ratio of cannabinoids, the medically-active component to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC - the part that gives you the high), is minimised. International experience shows us that people who use it medicinally do not get addicted (as can occur when cannabis is smoked). This is in part because of the low concentration of THC and also because of the oral route of administration, which changes the speed it enters the bloodstream.  There are no receptors in the part of the brain, which controls breathing and circulation. Hence it is almost impossible to overdose and kill yourself with oral cannabis by suppressing the breathing centre. Opiates, which are widely prescribed for pain, can do exactly that and are responsible for more deaths each year than illicit drugs. Medicinal cannabis, in simplest terms, can provide a clinical benefit without making you ""high"" if administered orally at a set dose. Benefits include relief of chronic pain (especially neuropathic pain), nausea associated with cancer and chemotherapy, some forms of epilepsy and multiple sclerosis. Further research will likely show other benefits, especially in conditions of the nervous system. The world is moving in this direction. Some 30 states in the US (the original home of Nixon's war on drugs) now have legal medicinal cannabis. Six states have gone even further.  Other countries with legal medicinal cannabis include South Africa, Chile, Israel, Germany, Italy and Mexico. So how do we introduce medicinal cannabis in Australia? The answer is to treat medicinal cannabis like any other therapeutic agent. It should be prescribed where there is evidence to support its use. Side effects need to be understood by its users. It needs to be regulated like any other pharmaceutical item and prescribed by doctors, dispensed by pharmacists. This is the standard model... not rocket science! Currently there are many Australians self medicating, illegally, by using inhaled cannabis. They do this because they get a medical benefit. Some of these people are the strongest advocates for medicinal cannabis, whose lobbying to politicians brought us to where we are now on the issue. The bottom line is... there is more than enough evidence to support the use of medicinal cannabis in certain people to treat certain conditions. Much like we don't use a blood pressure medication for asthma, we don't use medicinal cannabis for blood pressure. Like all medications, there are potential side effects but we currently use drugs that are potentially more harmful than medicinal cannabis but with far fewer hoops to jump through. With a modicum of goodwill and general common sense, we can get to the proverbial level playing field where it is no easier or harder to prescribe cannabis than any other medicinal product.

""It's about trying to make a difference to individuals, their families and friends in incredibly difficult circumstances."" The trial for children with severe epilepsy, who do not respond to traditional medical approaches, will be first to start, Ms Skinner said. It will be conducted by doctors at the Randwick and Westmead childrens hospitals, while the government will also set up a Medical Cannabis Expert Panel under the state's Chief Medical Officer, Kerry Chant. ""For a long time this issue has been discussed, but what we have today is NSW marching forward,"" Mr Baird said on Sunday, announcing that the government would spend $9 million on the three trials. To procure the cannabis for the trials, the government will first attempt to negotiate an import arrangement with the federal government. ""We're asking for that to be done as quickly as possible,"" Mr Baird said. ""If we need to deal with the supply ourselves, we are ready to go in relation to that, but we need to decide whether it can be imported. I expect that, in coming weeks, to be resolved."" The policy was immediately welcomed by the NSW branch of the Australian Medical Association. ""This will allow sick people access to medicine that is being tested and examined for efficacy – potentially improving their lives in the short-term and providing evidence to help the wider population in the longer term,"" AMA NSW president Saxon Smith said. ""I'm glad the government is broadening its approach to the trials, allowing for more than just treatment of terminal illness,"" Dr Smith said. ""The move into paediatric epilepsy is a welcome one, as research on short and long-term side-effects is especially important in any medicine given to children."" The NSW government is also instructing police not to charge adults with terminal illness who use marijuana, or their carers. But Labor's Adam Searle said the government should move faster in providing pain relief for the terminally ill. ""We have passed the time for trials; the science is in, and we know that people are already running the risk of arrest by using cannabis for pain relief. People suffering from terminal illnesses need more pain relief options now, not in a few years."" Hundreds of people are expected to be included in the three trials. ""I have been absolutely clear this is not about the use of crude cannabis which does have serious potential ill-health effects,"" Ms Skinner said. ""This is about looking derivatives of cannabis that can be useful in treating these conditions."" Copyright © 2023","Dec 21, 2014 ...

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 3 years ago West Australian man Jim Plamondon claims to have found a loophole to legally import medicinal cannabis into Australia. The former Busselton resident said he used the Therapeutic Goods Administration Traveller's Exemption to bypass Australian bureaucracy, and claims to be the first Australian to have succeeded at the feat. Mr Plamandon said he successfully brought Thai-prescribed cannabis products into WA to treat his chronic pain on April 8. West Australian man Jim Plamondon says his success bringing medicinal cannabis to Australia under the TGA's Traveller's Exemption, opens the doors for Australians to source medicinal cannabis. overseas. As he landed at Perth Airport Mr Plamondon, who usually resides in Thailand, said he ticked the box on his arrival card stating he was bringing ""goods that may be prohibited or subject to restrictions"". When asked if he was carrying medicines he answered they had been prescribed by a Thai medical practitioner. He said he had ""no issues"" with customs officials when declaring the CBD oil he was carrying in his luggage and was waved through customs without having his bags examined. The TGA's Traveller's Exemption allows travellers and their carers to bring up to three months worth of prescribed therapeutic goods for medical treatment into the country which would otherwise be listed as non-controlled substances. The rules don't specify the country of origin of the prescription, but they do require travellers to have accessed the drug through a pharmacist. A spokesperson from the Australian Health Department confirmed that cannabis had been included in the exemption list in June 2017 and travellers bringing the drug into Australia under the above circumstances did not break federal regulations. They said the Department of Health kept no record of the number of importations through the exemption but they said it was ""unlikely"" for Mr Plamondon to be the first citizen to do so. Under current federal and state legislation, patients suffering from severe health conditions can legally access prescription-based medicinal cannabis in Australia. Gaining access to the medication, however, can take up to several months. It requires patients to get a prescription issued by a TGA and Western Australia Department of Health authorised specialist and, since the drugs are not included within the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), they can come with a significant pricetag. Mr Plamondon, who works as a marketing vice-president for the Thailand-based cannabis advocacy group Thai Cannabis Corporation, said despite efforts by the Australian government to streamline the application process, only 1 per cent of the country's 3.24 million chronic pain sufferers were predicted to get access to the drug in 2019. However, he said his success in legally importing cannabis opened the doors for Australian patients to bypass Australian prescription rules and outsource medicinal cannabis from countries such as Thailand. ""If they suffer from any of the 38 medical conditions for which Thailand's doctors can prescribe cannabis - including chronic pain - then they can visit Thailand and bring home a three-month supply of Thai-prescribed and Thai-legal medical cannabis declaring it to Australian customs and claiming it under the Traveller's Exemption as I did,"" he said. ""Do this 'Thailand twist' every three months and you can have medical cannabis year-round without battling the Australian government's broken medical cannabis."" Although the recreational use of cannabis in Thailand remains illegal, recent Thai legislation changes allow for registered patients to posses certain amounts of cannabis if they have a prescription from a licensed doctor, dentist or traditional medical practitioner. Thai practitioners are allowed to prescribe medicinal cannabis to treat 38 medical conditions, including some of those endorsed by the TGA such as epilepsy, chronic pain and cancer. Other conditions listed within Thai medicinal cannabis regulations include migraines, menstrual cramps, concussion and ADHD. A passionate cannabis advocate, Mr Plamondon is now urging the government to cut the red tape surrounding the drug and to include GPs to the list of accredited practitioners who can prescribe it. ""It's time for Australia's government to give Australian battlers a fair go at medical cannabis by making cannabis as easy for family GPs to prescribe as codeine, and as easy for pharmacists to supply,"" he said. ""Until then the only legal hope for millions of Australian chronic pain patients is the 'Thailand twist'."" Copyright © 2023","Apr 21, 2019 ...

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 7 years ago The Australian Medical Association of Queensland has urged caution following confirmation of a medicinal cannabis trial in the state. AMAQ president Chris Zappala said he welcomed the trial, which Health Minister Cameron Dick revealed would likely be held at Brisbane's Lady Cilento Children's Hospital. Queensland's medicinal cannabis trial will likely be held at the Lady Cilento Children's Hospital. The move was met with approval by Queensland Council of Civil Liberties president Michael Cope on Tuesday, but he said it could have gone ""a lot further and a lot quicker"" and said a trial was not necessary. Dr Zappala urged more caution, saying medicinal cannabis, like any drug, could come with risks. ""The recreational use (of cannabis) has created inappropriate laissez-faire attitude with regards to how this might go, and that's one of the problems,"" he said. Dr Zappala said the trial was needed to determine the appropriate dosing and the right formulation of the medicinal cannabis. ""The key point is that we need to make sure we submit medicinal marijuana to the same rigorous testing, peer review and that it meets the same standards of risk benefit that we expect of all our medications,"" he said. ""It's only then that we can as a community and as a profession of doctors say 'yes, we think this is a good thing' and actively recommend it to patients, because that's obviously a very different thing to someone on their own deciding they're going to go off and try it."" Dr Zappala said there was a view that doctors were not open to new ideas and opportunities. ""That's just not true at all,"" he said. ""But what we do want to see is appropriate scientific understanding, because we need to understand not just the potential benefits but also the risks. ""We know, for example, that marijuana can contribute to mental illness and the long-term effects of prescribing a person marijuana are not known and that needs to be known, particularly if we're talking about kids who might wind up on marijuana of some form for years during their stage of development."" Dr Zappala said it was still unclear whether there was a ""completely benign formulation"" of cannabis. ""Obviously, you can smoke it and get a high, but to suggest you can put it in an oil form (and) all of a sudden the bad effects just drop away and there's no problem, well, we don't know that and that's one of the reasons we have to have a trial and have to measure the risks against the benefits,"" he said. Dr Zappala said all medicinal cannabis use needed to be regulated and strictly by prescription only. ""This notion that people might be able to grow it for medicinal purposes and that's going to be manageable and controllable, that just doesn't make good sense to us,"" he said. ""Because that's obviously still open to potential abuse, so although I deeply sympathise with people who have intractable pain or recalcitrant epilepsy, those sorts of things, as a doctor you're always very, very worried about the potential harm you might cause. ""That's what we need to be very aware of before we actually write a script about this stuff."" Copyright © 2023","Oct 21, 2015 ...

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 3 years ago The legalisation of recreational cannabis in the ACT would be a “micro-experiment” that could test the theories of both sides of politics and potentially pave the way for further decriminalisation, a leading researcher said. While the Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics at Sydney University does not have a position on recreational cannabis use, academic director Professor Iain McGregor said the new ACT law would provide researchers with plenty of material. “Are there going to be more arrests for driving under the influence, are the number of acute hospital admissions [going to rise] or is everything going to be exactly the same, and what are the implications?” he said. “It might help pave the way for broader decriminalisation.” His comments come after ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr said the federal government should focus on organised crime drug trade rather than the territory’s cannabis legalisation. The laws, passed on Wednesday and coming into effect on January 31, would make possessing 50 grams of cannabis or growing two plants legal. On Thursday Attorney-General Christian Porter said he would consider what action if any the Commonwealth government should take with the ACT laws. Mr Barr said it would be a “massive overreaction” for the federal government to intervene. “I presume none of them are arguing that recreational users should find themselves behind bars for two years which is what the Commonwealth Criminal Code allows for,” he told the Canberra Times. Jason Jordan, director of Medical Cannabis Research Australia, said the Commonwealth and territory split on the issue was going to “cause even more confusion” for people who self-medicate with cannabis. Mr Jordan, a patient advocate who takes medicinal cannabis to treat his multiple sclerosis, said one positive of the change was that it would help to reduce stigma with medical professionals and hopefully improve the rate of people accessing medical cannabis properly. “Normalising cannabis is an important part of what we do,” he said. “I can’t help but think that [legalising recreational use] helps with re-normalisation.” Chief executive of medical cannabis company Greenfield MC Nicholas Hanna said he also welcomed any law that reduces stigma surrounding cannabis. “We expect that many people who will benefit from this law will be persons who suffer from various medical conditions that are self medicating using cannabis,” he said.

By Hamish Hastie Cannabis plants at Little Green Pharma's WA facility.Credit:Marta Pascual Juanola In just 16 months medical cannabis outfit Little Green Pharma managed to jump every regulatory hurdle and beat out a wave of bigger companies wanting a slice of the burgeoning medicinal cannabis industry. The WA-based company started on a park bench in early 2017, when managing director Fleta Solomon met with a retiring scientist to discuss how a technology he created, to improve the delivery of active ingredients to the body, could be used in the emerging medical cannabis sector. “We shared a vision to not only help thousands of people across the globe with WA-grown cannabinoid medicines, but in the way cannabinoid therapies could be delivered,” Ms Solomon said. After that conversation, Ms Solomon hit the pavement looking for cash; first securing backing from some friends, then eventually banks. The company has since secured more than 20 different licenses and permits from state and federal authorities to become the first in Australia to successfully cultivate and manufacture its own medicinal cannabis. Last week, in a first for the company, it invited this masthead to tour their top-secret grow facility in WA’s South West. What became immediately apparent is how serious the company took security of the facility and anonymity of its staff. Not wanting to jeopardise any of its hard-fought licenses, there were military-style precautions to be adhered to. We met Ms Solomon at a pre-arranged location, signed non-disclosure agreements, were handed blindfolds and told to turn our phones off. Little Green Pharma managing director Fleta Solomon.Credit:Marta Pascual Juanola We were then driven blindly on a winding route before arriving at the facility, which was unremarkable apart from an imposing fence and fake business name on the front. Even through the first few doors we couldn’t spot anything unusual. It wasn’t until after we donned our hair nets, lab coats and shoe covers that the uniqueness of the facility became apparent. It took a few seconds for our eyes to adjust, but when they did we found ourselves surrounded by a sea of bright green cannabis plants sprouting from huge pots, soaking up the light beaming from rows of halogen globes above. I was expecting to be overwhelmed by the musky smell that often washes over music festivals – instead, it resembled the grassy, fertiliser-mixed scent of a nursery. The walls were covered in foil insulation and the space was small but every inch of it was being used. The path between the plants was tight but big enough that the growers, dressed in green hospital-style outfits, were able to manoeuvre between them to inspect and cut leaves to improve airflow. The next room was awash with yellow light and even more cramped, with the plants further along their growing journey. The rooms are clinical and every aspect from temperature to air flow is meticulously controlled in order to stop crop destruction. Pipes run up and down the rows feeding the plants a precise fertiliser mixture and we were told they had regimented sleep times where the lights are switched off. On our visit the plants, which the company lovingly refers to as its 'babies', were only a few weeks from harvest. Once the plants reach maturity they will be transported to the company’s manufacturing facility, another top secret location in Perth, where different types of cannabinoids will be extracted, turned into varying strengths and mixes of medical-grade oil, packaged, and eventually sold to approved patients. Ms Solomon is confident in the potential of the industry, which Little Green Pharma has experienced. In just a year of manufacturing those 'babies' have made their way into medicine for more than 700 patients. The plants were nearing harvest.Credit:Marta Pascual Juanola According to patient figures from the Therapeutic Goods Administration, from January 2017 to June 2019 more than 9200 medical cannabis access approvals had been issued. More than 6500 of those were issued this year alone. A recent prediction from industry lobbyists Prohibition Partners was the Asian market could be worth $8.5 billion in just five years, buoyed by enthusiastic patients and businesses keen to meet demand. The ASX has about 30 listed companies, collectively worth about $1.6 billion. According to research firm Mordor Intelligence the global cannabis market, which includes medical and recreational, will jump from $21.6 billion in 2018 to $133 billion by 2024. Even traditionally conservative organisations such as the Australian Medical Association have backed further investigation into its medical properties. AMA president Tony Bartone said the association wanted to see greater investment in education and training for doctors on medical cannabis and supported moves to make access processes quicker. “Therapeutic cannabinoids that are deemed safe and effective should be made available to patients for whom existing medications are not as effective,” he said. Unlike lots of other cashed-up competitors, Little Green Pharma, which has remained a private company, went small first and partnered well. Ms Solomon claimed this was one of the reasons they were able to begin operating so quickly. “We were able to gain first mover advantage not only due to our ‘proof of concept’ business model, but because we partnered with an existing 'good manufacturing practice' manufacturer with an existing narcotic licence,” she said. “It was about proving we had all the relevant licences and processes from seed to sale. “This has been the hardest thing to navigate. It was literally an unpaved road that we had to that we had to create ourselves. “It was exciting, challenging, time consuming and quite costly. But now that we've done it, we have a fully operational integrated supply chain from importing seed genetics, to cultivating, manufacturing, packaging and distribution. Growers removing leaves to improve airflow between the plants.Credit:Marta Pascual Juanola “We have proven our entire supply chain and have revenue now from patient sales so we have significantly de-risked the business.” This revenue has given the company confidence to expand its operations to meet Australian demand but also venture into Europe, whose industry is also in its infancy and has equally strict cultivation and manufacturing standards. It also wants to ramp up R&D of different delivery methods and products but to do that it will need money and a public float of the company is being explored. “Being a private company has its advantages – we’ve been able to act swiftly and remain nimble,” Ms Solomon said. “We are actively exploring the European markets to distribute our medicines. Germany is a huge market as they've had 180,000 prescriptions for cannabinoid medicines, which have been reimbursed. “However, as we move to fund clinical research and expansion projects, we need to explore all avenues for raising capital, including a public listing.” Whatever path the company chooses Ms Solomon is confident they won’t have trouble raising cash. “It's not something that you really have to sell, everybody just gets it,” she said. “The social impact this business can have is incredible. The patient stories are very real.” Last week Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt announced changes to the sector that would simplify administration, remove red tape, simplify patient access and prioritise ‘major’ cannabis projects. The government has also agreed in principle to adopt all 26 recommendations of a recent review of the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967, which will have ramifications for the medical cannabis sector. The news was welcomed by the industry worried that Australia would miss its chance to supply the rest of the world with cannabis. ""The priority given to industry participants who are investing more heavily will encourage legitimate players to continue that investment, which will ultimately benefit patients,” Medical Cannabis Industry Association chair Peter Crock said. Canadian and American giants such as Canopy Growth Corporation have had more than a decade to grow their businesses and have the jump on exports. Ms Solomon warned there was only a small window of opportunity for Australia to make a global mark in the sector.  Credit:Marta Pascual Juanola Another WA company AusCann recently celebrated the first ever delivery of cannabis resin from a Canadian supplier MediPharm Labs. Ms Solomon said there was only a small window of opportunity for Australia to carve out its spot and regulators needed to remove barriers quickly. “Australia has an opportunity to supply international markets with premium-grade medicinal cannabis products,” she said. “We are relying on the government and regulators to support local expansion for the export market, because other jurisdictions will quickly catch up. “We are thankful to the government for the high quality products we produce but we do wish the long administrative waiting times could be improved so Australia as an industry could flourish.” A Department of Health spokesman confirmed the Office of Drug Control had received 250 applications for licences to cultivate, produce and manufacture medicinal cannabis received to date. But only 70 licences had been granted and 30 permits had been issued allowing work to begin. With hundreds of licences set to be granted over the next few years Ms Solomon predicted cannabis would eventually become a commodity. The company is looking to differentiate itself in other ways and the conversation Ms Solomon had with the retiring scientist in 2017 is driving that innovation quest. “In five years from now there is a good possibility that cannabis will just be a commodity, and the need to differentiate yourself becomes very real,” she said. “The Canadians are focusing largely on the recreational side since cannabis was legalised and their focus on the edible market is consuming them. “Our vision however, and how we're different is we are pharmaceutical driven and will focus on optimising how cannabinoid medicines are delivered into the human body. “In the next few years our expertise will focus on the manufacturing and pharmaceutical side. “We're going to be exploring optimal delivery systems from patches through to suppositories and sprays to help solve real patient issues. “One day, we may even be able to explore at a DNA level, and look at personalised medicine for cannabinoid therapies.” Copyright © 2023","Aug 9, 2019 ...

This was published 4 years ago An Australian company is testing whether medicinal cannabis product could be used to treat medical conditions in family pets. After a successful trial of cannabis-based medicine to help treat conditions in dogs, CannPal is now expanding its testing to cats. CannPal founder and Canberran for more than two decades Layton Mills is helping to develop cannabis-based treatments for pets. The company's managing director Layton Mills, who was previously based in Canberra, said the products could be used to treat a range of illnesses. ""For dogs, we've been able to treat conditions like osteoarthritis and hip dysplaysia and skin health and other areas like epilepsy and behavioural issues,"" Mr Mills said. ""When we talk about what can be treated, at the moment the sky is the limit as we're learning more about the plant. ""No one has done this in Australia before."" CannPal recently announced it would work with Eurofins Animal Health to develop pain treatments using cannabis products for cats, with approvals being carried out. The first trial involved 11 dogs; eight were given active compounds containing cannabinoids while the other three were given placebos. Mr Mills said no adverse effects had been recorded in the initial trial. ""Dogs are a lot easier to develop a drug for than cats because cats internal systems are known for being very finicky,"" he said. ""We found that we have a good safety profile with the formulation and now we're able to expand."" Medicinal cannabis for human consumption is already legal in Australia, but patients looking to use it have to go through several approval processes with the Therapeutic Goods Administration, federal and state governments. Among the conditions treated in humans are epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain and chemotherapy-induced nausea. It isn't only the company that's excited by the prospect of cannabis-based medicine for pets. The Australian Veterinary Association said research in the area represented a lot of potential. Veterinary association president Paula Parker said the medicine could provide many benefits once it had been fully tested. ""We're seeing pets live longer and as a result we're seeing more geriatric diseases in pets like osteoarthritic diseases or cancer,"" Dr Parker said. ""There's a lot of potential for treatment using effective compounds and the right dosages."" It's estimated 60 per cent dogs between seven and 11 will develop arthritis and one in two will form some kind of cancer. In cats, 61 per cent of those over the age of six have arthritis in at least one joint. ""There's a recent trend of the humanisation of pets, where they are treated as good, if not better, than children,"" Mr Mills said. ""Pets are being treated a lot better and getting better medical care and are living longer, but a negative result from this is they're developing a lot of age-related issues."" Dr Parker said little was known about the effective of cannabis-derived medicine's effect on pets due to cannabis being illegal in Australia, and little research had been done in the area. She was looking forward to further research in Australia, and findings coming from overseas. ""What our colleagues in the US and Canada have found is as cannabis has become legalised and its becoming more common in homes there, we're seeing an increase in dogs and cats treated for toxicity,"" Dr Parker said. ""We're seeing more edible cannabis products, and with pets being scavengers, they can go after the edible products and can become intoxicated quite easily."" Since trials began of testing cannabis-derived products to treat conditions in dogs, Mr Mills said he had been inundated with correspondence from pet owners across the country. CannPal's founder said the next step in the process was getting the drugs approved and distributed only through registered vet specialists. While the trial with dogs was labelled a success, the upcoming one involving cats would be treated carefully. ""Pending the next six to 12 months of the studies going well, we'll have a really good idea of the success rate of the drug and we'll have a good idea of if the product is going to be approved,"" Mr Mills said.

Recent changes at a federal level permit legally-grown cannabis for medicinal cannabis products, but the drug remains a prohibited substance. The Therapeutic Goods Administration is considering downgrading it to a ""controlled substance"" class, which will place it alongside morphine. Dr Walker said he was hopeful the government could fast track approval to help those suffering with epilepsy, cancer and chronic pain, but said it could be up to 18 months before prescriptions start to be filled. ""This is a proper effective way of delivering cannabis through the nose,"" Dr Walker said. ""The nasal delivery makes it quite user-friendly, especially for little children."" The NSW government is about to embark on its third - and biggest - clinical trial involving 330 cancer sufferers. Previously in NSW, there have been trials involving the terminally ill and children with severe epilepsy. In Victoria, a small group of children with severe epilepsy are involved in a separate clinical trial. As for the efficacy of the treatment, Dr Walker pointed to two significant studies, of 137 and more than 220 respectively, which showed how epilepsy sufferers could benefit from medical cannabis. ""They have shown that there's anything from a 36 to 54 per cent reduction in seizure frequency,"" he said. But people won't be getting high from using the treatment, as the medicine does not interact with brain receptors in the same way as illicit cannabis. ""The important thing is that we've got to get the message out that medical cannabis has nothing to do with people smoking stuff,"" Dr Walker said. MGC will combine SipNose's system, which enables direct nose-to-brain delivery, with the cannabinoid compounds they produce. AAP Copyright © 2023","Mar 3, 2016 ...

Managing director Fleta Solomon says her company’s treatments are governed by strict advertising laws, so it limits what her staff can say. Despite this, she says the general public’s interest speaks volumes. “We almost have like a call centre to literally just take inquiries. We’d never say cannabis is or isn’t right for them, but we point them [patients] in the right direction. It’s about holding their hand and looking at how can they best access a doctor?” Little Green Pharma listed on the ASX in February 2020 just before the COVID pandemic hit, with a simple pitch to investors: to take quality medicinal cannabis products to Australia and the world. Little Green Pharma founder-CEO Fleta Solomon moved to Switzerland just before COVID-19 took hold.Credit:   The company has a Western Australian manufacturing facility, exports its oils and makes them available locally under the Therapeutic Goods Administration’s (TGA) special access scheme. Medicinal cannabis products can come in the form of oils, pills, nasal sprays and other formations and can be used to treat conditions such as chronic pain, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and chemotherapy-related side effects, though access is strictly limited. The products remain tightly regulated in the Australian market but that hasn’t stopped countless operators from trying their luck. At the moment, patients are able to access cannabis oil and other products if their doctors apply for prescriptions under the special access scheme for cases where there are no other treatment options. Licensed operators are also able to grow cannabis and export products offshore. Investors have been backing Australia’s nascent pot stocks for the past five years hopeful that entrepreneurs will be able to convert their crops into cash. There’s evidence for their high hopes. Americans are set to spend $US23 billion ($30 billion) a year on legal cannabis by 2025, according to projections from business insights firm Statista. Ibisworld believes the Australian market could reach $575 million by 2025. But the amount of capital invested in these companies currently dwarfs the revenues coming in. The 20 biggest ASX-listed companies with an exposure to cannabis have a combined market capitalisation of more than $2 billion. According to Ibisworld, the sector’s producers are expected to generate $32 million in revenues this year. Little Green Pharma is also somewhat of a novelty in the colourful, multibillion-dollar world of Aussie cannabis - a company not only breaking even, but eking out a profit in the first half of 2021. Solomon acknowledges there’s still a big hill to climb before the sector pays for itself, but argues the investors now exposed to these companies are here for long-term growth. “Now that the initial hype is gone, we’re getting to the next stage investors who actually want to see a return,” she says. The path forward  A large cohort of Australia’s medicinal cannabis companies were founded with the express purpose of creating treatments for patients who have run out of other approved options. The sector encompasses a range of businesses involved in the manufacture, distribution and export of cannabis flowers and oils as well as R&D-focused biotechs hoping drugs including elements of the plant will prove effective at fighting everything from chronic pain to mental health conditions. Founders and investors in the space are often driven by finding solutions for patients who haven’t found any other options to treat pain, seizure or other health issues. Cann Group chief executive Peter Crock  The office of drug control oversees production licences while the TGA regulates access to products via the special access scheme. Patients are able to access products via a doctor’s prescription in cases where there are no other available treatments. And the past 12 months have been kind to the sector. At the end of last year, the TGA made a landmark decision to reclassify products that contain low-dose cannabidiol, or CBD, so that they can be sold over the counter in Australian pharmacies without a prescription. It was significant validation for the sector, and big consumer names were on board. In February, unlisted firm Cannatrek announced it was partnering with Chemist Warehouse to supply pharmacy products to consumers. Chemist Warehouse chairman and co-founder Jack Gance said the pharmacy chain was “delighted to be able to be leaders in this area” to bring cannabis products to consumers without need for a prescription. Cannatrek boss Tommy Huppert admits that while the opportunity for these products is huge, it may be at least a year before these products are registered with the TGA to come to market. No products were ready to be registered when the regulator agreed to the rule change last year, and companies are now working to bring products, and their evidence of effectiveness, to the regulator. “It is quite a formidable pathway being presented,” he said. The evidence hurdles The other challenge for the sector is the question of evidence that cannabis actually works to solve pain and other ailments. Earlier this month, the Faculty of Pain Medicine at the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists warned doctors to think hard before prescribing cannabis to patients for non-cancer treatment and outside of clinical trials, claiming there is not enough evidence that it helps with chronic pain. In its own advice to patients, the TGA advises Australians “there have been very few well-designed clinical trials using medicinal cannabis, so there is limited evidence on its success in treating different medical conditions, or on effective forms and dosages”. Outside of treatment for epilepsy, cancer and palliative care, more work needs to be done, the regulator said. Some of the earliest movers in the medicinal cannabis space say they want additional clinical evidence more than anyone. “That’s exactly what we are pushing for,” managing director of Cann Group, Peter Crock, says. Cann was the first Australian company to be licensed to cultivate medicinal cannabis under the office of drug control rules. Crock says it’s critical that the sector focuses on the long game, which includes building evidence to get medicinal cannabis products recognised as registered medicines and give doctors the confidence to prescribe. “It’s understood this isn’t going to be an overnight thing. It’s more important to do it correctly, and not foot-fault on the way through, than to rush through and blow yourself up.” Cann is forecasting revenues of between $8 million and $10 million this financial year, after it exports cannabis product to German and UK partners later this year. A core part of its expansion strategy is a cultivation and processing facility in Mildura, for which the company secured $50 million in debt financing from National Australia Bank last year to help build. ‘Delivering on revenue is the number one thing they are looking for us to do.’ While the company is hoping to grow revenues substantially in coming years, it’s also running at a half-year after tax loss of $9.4 million - $1 million more than the same time last year. Crock says his investors seem happy with the way the company is investing in Australia, but the business won’t forecast its path to profitability or when that facility might pay for itself. “I think the support we are getting [from investors] is showing confidence that we are [proceeding] in the right manner. Delivering on revenue is the number one thing they are looking for us to do.” The long-term payoff  Pot stocks have long been a passion project for retail investors, who have seen both a long-term opportunity and the chance to buy in and out of small cap stocks as they chase short-term wins. Investor Nathaniel Lee has positions in five ASX-listed cannabis companies, including Cann and Little Green Pharma. He says he’s bought in and out of the sector over the past five years and is under no illusions that companies will make big profits in the next few years. Despite this, he sees long-term opportunity in the sector. “What is good about it at the moment is lots of companies have been through that new idea phase, now they are consolidating,” he says. Given that the Australian market is only a few years into researching cannabis-based products, there’s huge opportunity in the commercialisation phase for the sector which hasn’t even really begun. “I just see it as a huge market from then on,” he says. Entrepreneurs in the sector who have successfully built healthcare businesses in the past say local companies face barriers because they are not yet registered medicines. “The biggest barrier is drug filing, a pathway that unlocks enormous potential but can only beachieved through clinical validation,” says Medlab founder Sean Hall. “[It’s] a pathway ‘pot stocks’ are generally not taking. Drug filing involves creating a validated evidence package including longitudinal data-approved manufacturing protocols.” Hall, who sold his BioCeuticals brand to Blackmores in 2012, now runs Medlab, which is focused on research and development of registered medicines in hopes of taking these global. Solomon agrees it will be a couple of years before patients will be able to go into a chemist and see CBD oil on the shelves, but this doesn’t mean the sector isn’t succeeding. “The costs associated with this industry are really high, the regulatory compliance costs are huge. And you really need to have sales at scale,” she says. “I don’t see that as an unfair thing, it’s just the industry we’re in. It’s not different from [any] other drug that comes to market.” Start the day with major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion from our leading business journalists delivered to your inbox.

This was published 3 years ago Shareholders in many of the cannabis companies to have listed on the Australian sharemarket in recent years are licking their wounds as the initial euphoria surrounding medical cannabis gives way to disappointment. Cannabis has been one of the hottest sectors of the market, after rapid growth in consumption of medicinal cannabis and legalisation of its recreational use in some parts of the world. Share price falls of cannabis stocks may prove temporary as global demand for the plant and its medical uses increases.  The local industry started to gather steam after the government legalised patient access to Australian-grown and manufactured medicinal cannabis in 2016. In 2018, the sector received a further boost when Australia lifted legal restrictions on the export of medical cannabis.  That sent share prices sky high as day traders and short-term investors looked to cash in on the action. Dozen of cannabis companies – from cultivators to those developing medical cannabis – raised capital by conducting initial public offerings on the Australian Securities Exchange. Their shares initially made stellar gains for those who invested. However, the share prices of most of the companies in the sector have since dived. Many do not produce any revenue, let alone make profits or pay dividends to shareholders. Even so-called high-quality operators, such as AusCann Group, have been caught up in the sell-off, with its share price falling by more than 40 per cent since the start of the year, despite the Australian sharemarket overall lifting by about 20 per cent over the same period. After trading at more than $1.50 in the first half of 2018, its shares are now changing hands at about 40¢ – a fall of more than 75 per cent. AusCann is developing a cannabis-based pill for chronic pain control, potentially a huge market given that the opiates used to control pain today are addictive and can induce respiratory failure. A factor in the demise of cannabis companies is that shares in some of the most popular pot stocks have come out of  ""escrow"" – a period in which the original investors are not allowed to sell their shares – in the first half of this year. When the two-year escrow period for AusCann ended earlier this year, for example, large parcels of shares were sold, contributing to downward pressure on price. Developing medical products requires huge investments in clinical trials that can take many years. Stewart Washer, one of the original founders of AusCann who no longer has a role with the company but remains a shareholder, says its prospects remain good as ""medical cannabis has proven itself to be a real sector"". Dr Washer says AusCann is not a ""big risk [for investors] as it is making a hard capsule pill and we know that doctors and patients want the pills"". AusCann made its debut on the ASX in early February 2017, with an issue price of 20¢ a share. Technically, it was a ""reverse takeover"" of another company that was already listed. Even with the share price at about 40¢,  those who bought at the issue price have doubled their money in two years. ""When there is a mania for a particular sector, it usually relates to the potential for extraordinary growth,  but there's still very restrictive requirements for medical cannabis,"" says Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. 'They are speculative [stocks] and without further regulatory relaxation there will be a number of these companies that will not survive,"" McCarthy says. Richard Ivers, portfolio manager at the Prime Value Emerging Opportunities Fund, which specialises in ""micro"" capitalised Australian-listed shares, does not hold cannabis stocks. ""There's a lot of speculative [cannabis] stocks out there and it is hard for a fund for retail investors, where capital preservation comes first, to invest in these companies,"" Iver says.

Ms James, 27, used to work full time, ride horses and go to university, but in 2013 that all came crashing down. Francesca James, 27, at the Cannabis Access Clinic in Subiaco.Credit: Hamish Hastie What first started as a dull pain in her shoulders eventually spread throughout her body until it got so bad she was sometimes forced to sit in a wheelchair. She was diagnosed with chronic pain from psoriatic arthritis and was on a cocktail of pain-relieving drugs. “The pain was like the feeling you get after you’ve finished the hardest workout you’ve ever done, but everywhere and everyday,” Ms James said. “I went from being a full-time student and working full-time to being bed-ridden and in a wheelchair. “The medication they put me on straight away made me worse. I was getting gut problems and stuff that I hadn’t gotten before because of it. I was getting no sleep and got up to 95 kg. “I was being prescribed a cocktail of medications. Because of the opiates I got restless leg syndrome and because of that I got prescribed something to counteract that and then I was prescribed something else to counteract the side effects of the other drug.” Eventually Ms James had enough of prescription medication and in her desperation sourced cannabis for pain relief on the black market. “After I started using it it helped with my inflammation and I came off a lot of medications, I found the THC (an active chemical compound in marijuana) helps my sleep and pain significantly,” she said. Ms James’ story is not unique and with growing public and regulatory acceptance of cannabis as a medicine doctors and businesses are finding new markets. The Cannabis Access Clinic in Subiaco aims to streamline the access to medicinal cannabis with health professionals proficient in the area. In WA medicinal cannabis products are considered unapproved controlled drugs and can only be prescribed with approval from the WA Department of Health and federal Therapeutic Goods Administration. The drugs are not smoked, but rather come in oil and spray forms. As of the end of November the Therapeutic Goods Administration had approved a total of 2339 applications for medicinal cannabis. Dr Berenice Blakemore has been a GP for 18 years and started seeing the Cannabis Access Clinic’s first patients on Wednesday. She said in her time as a GP she’d had countless patients inquiring about medicinal cannabis to treat their chronic pain symptoms and this clinic would be able to do it in a safe and transparent way. “I’ve definitely had patients who have decided to try cannabis and source it from wherever but they don’t know what they’re getting they don’t know how pure the product is, and it's expensive and still illegal,” Dr Blakemore said. “Through us the patient is prescribed a guaranteed product, it’s pure and unadulterated which is different from maybe accessing supplies from somewhere else. “It will become a natural process, you prescribe it, you tell them about possible side effects, outline the definite no-no’s like driving and pregnancy.” The clinic, which already has three locations on the east coast, charges an out-of-pocket $200 fee for an initial consultation and only takes patients from referrals. Dr Blakemore was careful to point out the clinic would not be dispensing any medicinal cannabis and there was still a rigorous process a patient needed to go through. “GPs will refer suitable patients to us who have exhausted all their pain-relieving options and they come in for an initial consult,” she said. “We go through the GP paperwork with them and what their expectations are and once they’ve had that initial consult a request for approval from the TGA is sent out and they usually get back to us within two weeks.” Department of Health WA advice to GPs states there is still limited evidence of variable quality that supports the use of medicinal cannabis in selected conditions, but it is expanding. An Australian Medical Association WA spokesman said they weren’t concerned with the clinic but reiterated the association’s position on medicinal cannabis that is had to be implemented in the health system slowly. For Ms James the clinic couldn’t have come quick enough. “It’s really exciting,"" she said. ""I’m sick of the stigma, I’m sick of the stereotyping and I don’t want to have to deal with criminals anymore to relieve my pain.” Copyright © 2023","Dec 12, 2018 ...

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 8 years ago Medical marijuana would be grown under licence from the federal government under a legalisation plan to be introduced to parliament next week by three MPs from the major parties and Greens. Under the bill, a new regulator separate from the Therapeutic Goods Administration would oversee the growing and supply of medical marijuana and determine the conditions for which it could be prescribed. The bill will be jointly backed by three MPs from a cross-party working group on drug policy: Green Richard Di Natale; Labor's Melissa Parke and Victorian Liberal Sharman Stone. ""Let's be grown up about this,"" said Ms Stone. ""We should allow those currently suffering cruel deaths to have access to medicinal cannabis. ""It isn't new. It isn't innovative. It's just Australia catching up."" The Senate private member's bill will not compel states to legalise medicinal marijuana. But it aims to solve the contentious issue of how it can be supplied and create a federal model that states can adopt through mirror legislation. ""We should have consistent regulation throughout the country as the PBS is under federal jurisdiction,"" Ms Stone said.   The proposed regulator would be staffed by experts relating to every aspect of growing and dispensing marijuana, from horticulturalists to pharmacologists. ""We've got to take the issue out of the hands of politicians,"" said medical doctor Mr Di Natale. ""We tried to come up with a model that reflected some of the best international models for delivering medical cannabis."" Ms Stone dismissed further clinical trials as ""time wasting"" and pointed to evidence about the effectiveness of medical marijuana from countries such as Canada and Israel. The MPs will brief their colleagues on the plan on Wednesday and have expressed confidence they can move it through the parliament. ""Momentum is everything and it's building,"" Dr Di Natale said. Medical marijuana advocates took heart from a letter from the Prime Minister Tony Abbott to talkback host Alan Jones earlier this year in which he expressed support for decriminalisation. ""I have no problem with the medical use of cannabis,"" Mr Abbott wrote. The Prime Minister's office has previously said decriminalisation was a matter for the states but referred questions about the bill to Health Minister Peter Dutton, whose office did not respond to questions. The Opposition Leader, Bill Shorten, who is yet to see the plan, said while medical marijuana provided relief for the ill its safety and effectiveness needed further study. ""Labor certainly supports jurisdictions that want to hold clinical trials,"" he said. Specially-grown medicinal strains can control or eliminate the drug's psychoactive component, THC and can be distributed as a tincture, or pharmaceutical extract.

Little Green Pharma managing director Fleta Solomon welcomed the changes.

""We applaud the WA Health Minister [Roger Cook] for implementing this streamlined policy and are confident it will make a huge difference to WA patients, who have previously been disadvantaged by the state's time consuming and costly access process,"" she said. “When considering many using medicinal cannabis products have serious illnesses and are sometimes financially strained, the previous access regime unnecessarily added a number of months and additional costs to the process."" From November 2016 until August 2019, WA doctors issued 876 approvals to for medicinal cannabis prescriptions. Medicinal cannabis products, which remain at stubbornly high prices, remain classified as controlled drugs throughout Australia and do not attract federal subsidies. The Department of Health reviewed three years of prescribing data in the lead-up to its decision. WA Health Minister Roger Cook said the new changes brought WA closer into line with other states and territories. “Whilst the listing of medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is the responsibility of the federal government, it is important for the Commonwealth to have a flexible system that expedites affordable access to new and emerging healthcare treatments,” he said. The Global Cannabis Report, released on Monday, found Australia was at the cusp of a cannabis revolution but still lagged behind the US and Canada, both of which had legalised the drug for both medical and recreational use in some states several years ago. Canada last year legalised the drug for recreational use nationwide, allowing adults 18 years or older to possess up to 30 grams of cannabis and buy it from licensed retailers. ""Oceania could become very attractive to investors in the near future as Australia boasts an optimum climate for growing some strains of cannabis that are expensive to produce in more established markets such as Canada,"" the Global Cannabis Report authors said. ""Furthermore, recent and anticipated changes to the law will enable the region to capitalise on strong growth within the industry. ""However, the region as a whole is highly conservative, and cannabis is illegal for medical and recreational use across most of the territories and islands."" According to the report, the US has lodged 8859 cannabis-related trademark applications with the World International Property Organisation, while Canada made 6640 applications.

This was published 7 years ago Victoria is set to become the first state in Australia to legalise marijuana cultivation to treat serious medical conditions including cancer, multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy and chronic pain. But the push - underpinned by a landmark report by the Victorian Law Reform Commission - hinges on the agreement of the Turnbull government, which is a signatory to international rules covering the cultivation and manufacture of cannabis. Medicinal cannabis my soon be legalised in Australia.Credit: Max Mason Hubers As revealed in The Age last month, a landmark study by the commission recommends a strictly controlled licensing scheme to produce medicinal cannabis, similar to the system for growing poppies. Under the report's 42 recommendations - almost all of which will be adopted in full by the Andrews government - licensed cultivators and manufacturers will be able to produce a range of cannabis products, including oils, tinctures, capsules, sprays and vaporisable liquids. These products will be sold at pharmacies, but only when authorised by a specialist doctor in a manner similar to the methadone program. But the report stressed medical marijuana will not be legally available in a smokable form. The commission's chairman, Philip Cummins, said the recommendations had been driven by compassion for those dealing with debilitating conditions who have no effective medical relief. The government will begin a cultivation trial at a Victorian research facility. An independent medical advisory committee will also be set up to provide advice about expanding eligibility to further patient groups. An office of Medicinal Cannabis will be established inside the Department of Health and Human Services to oversee the manufacture, dispensing and clinical aspects of the framework. Premier Daniel Andrews said it was one of his proudest days in politics. ""I've seen first hand how medicinal cannabis can change people's lives,"" he said. ""This landmark reform means Victorian families will no longer have to decide between breaking the law and watching their child suffer."" The report follows a pledge by Mr Andrews before the 2014 election to legalise medicinal cannabis, although he has stressed he does not support legalising marijuana for recreational use, or allowing it to be smoked to relieve medical conditions. The decision also follows concerns about the quality of illegally-sourced medical cannabis oil. Victoria is participating in a trial being undertaken in NSW. But specialist commissioner Ian Freckelton said the commission formed the view it was not appropriate to wait until the trial was completed. ""We were satisfied on the basis of those whom we met, many of whom had utilised medicinal cannabis to their advantage, and on the basis of research evidence, that it is an appropriate time for this modest step to be taken to alleviate suffering,"" he said. Dr Freckelton also said the plan to cultivate medicinal cannabis in Victoria would need federal government support, although it will not require federal legislation. ""The Commonwealth is the signatory to an important international convention in relation to narcotic drugs and so it is fundamental that Australia, including Victoria, comply with its international obligations in that regard,"" Dr Freckelton said. The commission has also flagged small changes to traffic laws to potentially allow people who have been legally prescribed medicinal cannabis to legally drive with the drug in their system. The decision to introduce a cultivation scheme follows high profile campaigns by several Victorian families using cannabis oil to treat chronically ill children, often in cases where legal medicines have not worked.

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 8 years ago  Almost two-thirds of Australians support the legalisation of cannabis for medicinal purposes, according to a new poll which coincides with a renewed push to relax the laws. A ReachTel survey of more than 3400 Australians shows that the majority back medicinal marijuana, with support highest among 51 to 65-year-olds. It comes as NSW Premier Mike Baird indicated on Wednesday that he supported the use of medical marijuana, despite having concerns about its supply and regulation. Earlier this month Cassie Batten, a pregnant mother from Mernda, was questioned by police after admitting to using cannabis oil to treat her disabled three-year-old, who has epilepsy and suffers from profound seizures. But it is unlikely that there will be any legislative change in Victorian in the near future, with both the Napthine government and Opposition saying they have no plans to legalise the drug. A spokesman for Victorian Health Minister David Davis said there needed to be a strong body of scientific research that proved marijuana was more effective than other drugs in order for it to gain approval for medical use. “Current evidence available strongly suggests that the balance of harms and risks does not support the use of cannabis for medicinal or recreational purposes ... The use of cannabis for medical or recreational purposes is illegal in Victoria and other states because evidence shows it causes harm to both cannabis users and the broader community.” An opposition spokesman said: ""Victorian Labor supports the use of pharmaceutical products that are approved and regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and we have no plans to amend Victoria’s drugs laws to decriminalise marijuana."" According to the survey, almost 80 per cent of Greens voters were in favour of medicinal cannabis compared to 69.9 per cent of Labor voters and 56.6 per cent of Coalition voters. Victoria Police released a statement on Monday saying its investigation into Ms Batten and her partner Rhett Wallace was an “enormously unfortunate situation” and they understood the challenging circumstances the couple faced. “Victoria Police fully recognises that there is a legitimate debate that needs to be had on the use of cannabis in medical circumstances. But this is a matter for parliaments to resolve for the good of the communities they represent.” Federal Liberal MP Sharman Stone, Labor member Melissa Parke and Greens senator Richard Di Natale wrote to Dr Napthine this week to express concern about the couple's treatment. The Australian Medical Association, Victoria, called for clinical trials on the medicinal use of cannabis in order to establish its potential and to determine guidelines around any future therapeutic uses. President Tony Bartone said there was growing evidence cannabis was an effective treatment for a range of symptoms. He said cannabis appeared to have medicinal uses for controlling muscle spasticity, some types of chronic pain, some kinds of nausea and as an appetite stimulant in patients with weight loss due to cancer or HIV. ""If deemed safe and effective, medicinal cannabis should be made available to patients for whom existing medications are not as effective,’’ he said.   Copyright © 2023","Jul 23, 2014 ...

Queensland is perfectly positioned to take advantage of a growing legal cannabis industry due to the legalisation of its medicinal use, the state government says. The ideal growing region for cannabis, the paper states, was within 35 degrees of the equator, which took in all of Queensland. ""With the use of medicinal cannabis increasing worldwide, the medicinal cannabis market could represent new opportunities for the Queensland agriculture industry,"" it says. ""Queensland's experience in growing industrial hemp may provide valuable lessons in the future."" The paper states Queensland's existing industrial hemp industry consisted of eight ""tightly regulated"" licensed growers, with more than 64 hectares of crop under cultivation. With the legalisation of medicinal cannabis, the state government saw an opportunity for the legal cannabis industry to grow. And it could reap the state millions in revenue. ""Australia has proven experience in growing medicinal products,"" the paper says. ""For example, Tasmania is licensed to grow poppies for the commercial production of alkaloid-based pharmaceuticals and is the largest producer of lawfully manufactured narcotic material in the world. ""Tasmania's poppy industry is now worth about $290 million, with around 23,000 hectares of crop grown by 850 farmers."" Medicinal cannabis was one of the United States' fastest-growing markets, the paper states, with its value increasing from $1.5 billion in 2013 to $2.7 billion in 2014. ""Some estimates suggest that the US market will be worth $25 billion by 2020,"" it says. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced on Monday that legislation to allow the use of medicinal cannabis would be introduced to Queensland Parliament in April, following a month of consultation.  Ms Palaszczuk said the legislation would be the ""most progressive"" in Australia. For independent news coverage, be sure to follow our Facebook feed. Copyright © 2023","Feb 29, 2016 ...

First, there was winemaking, helped along by degrees in molecular biology and microbiology. Then came speechwriting for her father, Mal Washer, former Federal MP in Western Australia. Eventually, she worked as a lawyer. But none of Darby's careers catches people's attention as much as her current role. Darby is now the managing director of AusCann, one of Australia's biggest medical cannabis companies. Managing Director of AusCann Elaine Darby says it was hard to turn her back on the scientific evidence supporting medical cannabis. ""If you'd told me two years ago I'd have been involved with cannabis, I'd have been really surprised,"" she says. ""You do get a weird response from some people."" When Darby learned about the industry, initially from her father (also a doctor and the former chairman of AusCann), she was sceptical. Elaine Darby and her father Dr Mal Washer.Credit: TREVOR COLLENS ""When [my father] told me to look into medical cannabis I thought it was probably just an excuse for people to get high,"" she says. That was until Darby looked at the clinical data and saw the kind of results people were getting for chronic conditions like nerve pain. ""I was astounded,"" she says. The ""eye opener"" drew her to want to help educate the medical community about medical cannabis and become involved in the production of high-quality, safe medications. In Australia, the legal situation for medical cannabis sales is complex, and varies from state to state. But what is clear is that career wise, there are (very legal) jobs to be had. ""In our firm our medical liaison managers play a very key role. These individuals go and educate doctors about medical cannabis,"" she says. ""Doctors generally are really keen to know. If there were [people] outside of companies doing that education, that would be good too,"" she says. There are also opportunities for clinical studies and scientific research into medical cannabis. ""The University of Sydney received [in 2015] almost $34 million from the Lambert family to do research in this area,"" Darby says. ""So there's a real need for good researchers to work [in the field]."" Then, of course, there will be production roles in growing, extraction techniques for manufacturing medical cannabis into a final pharmaceutical form, and flow on industries to provide equipment, lighting or greenhouses. The entire process is very highly regulated, not the least by the federally-controlled Office of Drug Control. One person who knows where this is all headed, not the least in terms of jobs, is Dr Danial Schecter. The Canadian is AusCann's chief medical officer and has trained its medical liaison officers, among other tasks. Schecter has been studying medical cannabis since his student days, and the clinic he opened in 2004, which specialises in cannabis-based medicine, has received more than 35,000 patient referrals since. He says that job-wise, the liaison-based role of the ""cannabinoid educator"" has proven to valuable link between patients, doctors and pharmacists. ""This is a role whereby someone is trained in various aspects of cannabinoid medicine and helps the patient to use cannabis in the best manner possible. This includes choosing the appropriate strain or formulation of cannabis, the best method of administration and help with dosing, titrating [measuring and adjusting] and monitoring,"" he says. It's a job that, while not necessarily seen yet in Australia, may be here in the future as the medical cannabis market develops. ""Cannabis is different from most other medications; it requires more effort by the patient and more coaching as they have to self-titrate their medication,"" Schecter says.

Cannabis is the hot new beauty ingredientCredit: Shutterstop A lot of this has to do with the legalisation of cannabis in anumber of states in the US: nine to be exact States - Alaska, California (the first state to do so in 1996), Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington have legalised cannabis’s recreational use and a further 29 states have legalised it for medical use. In Australia, recreational use of marijuana remains illegal across all federal, state, and territories. While Victoria was the first state in Australia to introduce legislation to legalise medicinal cannabis in early 2017 and the other states and territories and then followed suit. Co-founder of Cult Beauty, Alexia Inge told Harper’s Bazaar late last year that, “The legalisation of Marijuana [in multiple American states] has led to a flurry of research on the effects it has on the human body. It’s widely celebrated for its medicinal properties, but one of the unexpected side effects was the discovery of how amazingly calming and anti-inflammatory certain cannabinoids are on the skin”. Armed with this knowledge, the brand has launched some cannabis-based products including MGC Derma, with its cult CBD Herbal Repair Cream that helps to calm and soothe irritated skin and Marley Natural. (This comes hot on the heals of Malin+Goetz’s flirtation with the whole cannabis theme with their highly sought- after Cannabis EDP and The Escentric Molecules Escentric 04 with a dedicated cannabis note which both launched last year.) So, what are the benefits of cannabis-infused skin care? The central ingredient is CBD, that stands for cannabidiol, which is found in hemp plants and has no psychoactive or intoxicating effects but lots of health benefits including helping to reduce pain and inflammation. Holland and Barrett were trailblazers in the UK as the first high-street stockists’ of CBD oil; Gwyneth Paltrow is also a fan. She swears by CBD oil, telling Beauty website, Into The Gloss, in January this year, “If I have a particularly stressful time, someone gave me some CBD oil in a little drop. It doesn't make you stoned or anything, just a little relaxed.” So, apart from all the hype, CBD-based skin care does have bona fide anti- inflammatory properties and can be used an alternative for those suffering from eczema, psoriasis and acne. But, it is a controversial topic and not everyone is convinced, like London dermatologist Dr Frances Prenna, who says, “I think it is a bit of a hype. It is a great ingredient, but no more special than a lot of other emollient and anti-inflammatory ingredients like ginger, for instance.” While hemp-based products are having a moment, they have actually been around in The Body Shop’s best-selling Hemp range for decades. So is this all just a re- branding exercise? Legality issues are still in play as far as CBD skin care is concerned. Funnily enough, the UK is the world’s largest exporter of legal cannabis used in overseas medical products; while usage is not legal on home turf where UK law classifies it as a “Class B drug that is ‘illegal to possess in any form’.” Confused yet? The situation on CBD oil is quite unclear here too. I guess the proof will be in the pudding (or the cookie). In the meantime we have two cannabis-inspired products to try: The Body Shop Hemp Heavy Duty Lip is chock full of hemp seed oil and acts to soothe and hydrate parched lips.

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 8 years ago Lucy Haslam, the mother of the late medical marijuana campaigner, Dan, has criticised the state government for moving too slowly to provide the drug to the ill. Ms Haslam, whose son died in February five years after being diagnosed with cancer, testified before a federal Senate inquiry held at the NSW Parliament on Tuesday. ""We cannot afford to wait for the results of clinical trials,"" Ms Haslam said. ""Don't dismiss the urgent need of people now. ""If someone with a terminal illness says that their pain is less ... what are we worried about? The long-term side effects of using medicinal cannabis are completely irrelevant to that person."" The inquiry was held to discuss a federal bill, sponsored by Greens Senator Richard Di Natale, and with support from major party MPs, that would have the federal government license businesses to grow and import medical marijuana. The process would be overseen by the Office of Medicinal Cannabis, an independent regulator that would determine the conditions for which doctors could prescribe the drug. Mr Baird credited meeting Mr Haslam with changing his view on medical cannabis, which led to the government announcing a clinical trial.  ""Mike Baird knows I'm not very positive about how things are going,"" Ms Haslam later told Fairfax. ""Things are not going as well as he thinks."" ""I think [sufferers] need to have access to a [medicinal marijuana] supply. We're looking at years down the track [with the current clinical trial]."" Ms Haslam said the Premier had agreed to meet her to discuss the issue and praised him for showing ""initiative"". NSW trials, for childhood sufferers of intractable epilepsy and chemotherapy-related nausea are being planned and if successful could lead to legalisation of cannabis for medical purposes. Pediatric epilepsy patients will be first enrolled in 2016. Senator Di Natale said he hoped the federal bill would be introduced to Parliament by the middle of the year. ""For many people who need it right now potential unknown side effects [of marijuana] have to be offset against the known side effects of the other drugs they take,"" he said. Senator Di Natale, a medical doctor, said the risks of medicinal marijuana use by adults had been overstated and could be further lowered by strains grown in a legal environment. Ms Haslam testified that medical marijuana was best used after alternative treatment had been exhausted. She said her son had turned to it after chronic nausea from chemotherapy and after painful withdrawal and other side effects from opiate pain killers. Liberal MPs Sharman Stone and Warren Entsch have spoken publicly in favour of the bill. The Herald understands federal cabinet ministers have privately expressed support. Opposition Leader Luke Foley has called for urgent law changes to legalise medical marijuana on compassionate grounds. But the NSW branch of the Australian Medical Association has said trials are necessary, especially for treating children with medical marijuana.  The government has given police powers to decline to charge terminally ill patients in possession of 15 grams of cannabis or less. Copyright © 2023","Mar 31, 2015 ...

Considering legislation: Premier Mike Baird.Credit: Alex Ellinghausen  ''The Premier was sympathetic and agreed the time has come to address this issue and he supported my bid to work up a private member's bill,'' Mr Anderson said.  ''However, he joined with me in expressing grave concerns about the supply and the prescription of cannabis and the challenge in addressing those issues.''  He added: ''The Premier said that the issue of supply and prescription could not be avoided and indicated that if I could solve the supply and prescription issue through a tightly controlled and regulated process, then and only then would he support my efforts.''  On Thursday, Mr Baird said the government ''will give careful consideration to Mr Anderson's bill, and I have nothing but sympathy for the Haslam family as they struggle with their son's illness''.  A spokesman for Mr Baird said the matter would not be the subject of a conscience vote for Liberal MPs, as is often the case for social issues. This means the bill would require the support of the government to pass the lower house.  Greens MP John Kaye welcomed the Premier's support and said he was willing to delay his own proposed bill to give Mr Anderson time to develop his legislation.  ''Although we are not there yet, it is a big step forward from where we were a month ago,'' he said.  Mr Haslam's mother, Lucy, told the Northern Daily Leader the proposed bill was a ''significant breakthrough''. ''It gives us great hope that our politicians are sensing the changing attitudes of the Australian people,'' she said.  Last year, an upper house inquiry chaired by Nationals MP Sarah Mitchell recommended that a ''complete defence'' against arrest and prosecution be introduced for the ''authorised medical use of cannabis by patients with terminal illness and those who have moved from HIV infection to AIDS''.  However, the recommendation was rejected by Health Minister Jillian Skinner in the government's response.  Mr Anderson said the upper house inquiry did not address the supply issue and that he would work with Ms Mitchell and Nationals MP Trevor Khan ''to find those solutions''.

The Andrews Government is preparing to announce a cannabis 'cultivation trial' in Victoria.Credit: MCT In an Australian first, the Andrews government is preparing to announce a cannabis ""cultivation trial"", potentially clearing the way for a state-based medicinal cannabis oil industry. The controversial move follows a promise by Daniel Andrews before the November 2014 election to legalise cannabis oil for use in exceptional circumstances to treat conditions such as cancer, Dravet Syndrome, HIV/AIDS, glaucoma and Parkinson's disease. Premier Daniel Andrews.Credit: Emma Morgan Fairfax Media can reveal a landmark report by the Victorian Law Reform Commission - with recommendations to clear complex legal, medical, regulatory and jurisdictional hurdles - will be considered by cabinet in the next couple of days. Victoria does not have the power to allow cannabis to be imported. Although the secretary of the federal health department can make exceptions, the approval process for imports is seen as so strict, the commission does not believe the government could guarantee supply or quality on a long-term basis. That means Victoria would be forced to grow its own cannabis, most likely through a strictly controlled licensing scheme similar to Tasmania's system for cultivating alkaloid poppies. Before the 2014 election Mr Andrews said he did not want parents to be forced to choose between breaking the law and watching children suffer. But he stressed he did not support legalising marijuana for recreational use, or allowing it to be smoked to relieve medical conditions. A spokeswoman for Health Minister Jill Hennessy said the commission had provided a ""very comprehensive report"". ""The government is preparing a detailed response and we will have more to say soon,"" she said. ""The government has been clear from the outset that we are committed to legalising medicinal cannabis in exceptional circumstances, and we are getting on with delivering on our commitment to do so."" Under the most likely approach, potential growers will apply to the secretary of the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning for a licence. The application and employees and associates would also be referred to the the police commissioner for vetting. Growers would be subject to regular government inspections. In an earlier discussion paper, the commission canvassed what it called ""state controlled cultivation"", where the Victorian government would be directly responsible for growing growing cannabis for medicinal purposes, giving it the greatest control over the quality and quality. The looming decision, which is likely to be controversial, follows high profile campaigns by several Victorian families using cannabis oil to treat chronically ill children, often in cases where legal medicines have not worked. It also follows a police raid in May on Carrum Downs couple Matthew and Elizabeth Pallett. The couple were charged with possession, cultivation and trafficking offences, having openly provided cannabis-based tinctures, chocolates and butters to dozens of clients suffering from medical conditions ranging from multiple sclerosis, cancer, epilepsy and Crohn's disease. Concerns have also emerged about the quality of illegally-sourced medical cannabis oil. The Age reported last year that forensic testing of medical marijuana revealed dramatic variations in the contents of the product, which is often spruiked over the internet by unregulated producers who make bold claims about the benefits.

This was published 3 years ago In the first study of its kind, Australian researchers have found medical cannabis can potentially help treat cannabis addiction. The research, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, found that an oral cannabis spray called nabiximols combined with cognitive behavioural therapy helped reduce the number of days people with a cannabis addiction smoked the illicit drug by about 40 per cent. Australian research has found medical cannabis drug nabiximols can help treat cannabis dependence.Credit: GWPharma Lead author Conjoint Professor Nicholas Lintzeris from the University of Sydney said the randomised 12-week trial of 128 patients who had previously tried and failed to reduce their cannabis usage showed ""pretty significant"" results. Professor Lintzeris, who is also the director of drug and alcohol services, South East Sydney Local Health District said across the whole study the people in the nabiximols group had 40 per cent fewer cannabis use days compared to those in the placebo group. ""The majority of people in the nabiximols group either stopped using or dramatically reduced their use, maybe down to two, three, four days a month, whereas in the placebo arm, we found many people continued to use most days - four, five, six days out of seven,"" he said. The results were even starker when the researchers looked just at the proportion of people who were able to reduce their cannabis usage by 50 per cent or more. ""Almost over twice as many people had made that change in the nabiximols arm, so there was quite a significant difference between the groups,"" Professor Lintzeris said. Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug in Australia, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. Professor Lintzeris said cannabis dependence was ""quite common"" so this research was significant as it was the first time researchers had linked medication with counselling to help reduce cannabis dependence. Professor Michael Farrell, from the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, said the study was an ""important contribution"" to development of cannabis dependence treatment and it deserves further research. ""The findings are positive but modest,"" he said. ""We’re not looking at some radical effect, but it does provide an important conceptual discussion of ways we might consider this type of treatment into the future."" Professor Farrell and Professor Lintzeris both pointed out the cost of nabiximols - licenced in Australia for the treatment of multiple sclerosis at the cost of about $745 for six to eight weeks of treatment, according to MS Australia - was one drawback of the potential treatment. ""I think it needs more research before it would be automatically translated into practice, but it doesn’t mean that other possibly more affordable forms of this type of medication might be developed,"" Professor Farrell said. One aspect of the research not published in the JAMA paper, was that when the researchers looked at the data 12 weeks after participants stopped taking nabiximols, most of the changes the participants made had persisted. ""What was really encouraging was that we were actually able to demonstrate that most patients used the medication for a short period of time ... and then they were able to make those changes in their lives, come off the medication and not relapse,"" Professor Lintzeris said. ""That was really encouraging because I think that means we’ve got a viable treatment model."" Professor Lintzeris said more research needs to be done, but these results showed promise. ""We’re not saying let's start rolling it out at every general practice across Australia yet, but we're certainly going to be doing more clinical work and more research,"" he said.

""It's my understanding that there is evidence supporting the benefits of cannabis extracts in the treatment of a range of conditions but the evidence still needs to be of sufficient scientific quality to definitively answer questions about efficacy and safety,"" he said. ""I'm aware that there are already acknowledged pharmaceutical versions of cannabis derivatives, including an oral spray form that could offer medical benefits without the risks of smoking cannabis.""  Labor leader Mark McGowan said the public expected a more mature debate from their health minister on the issue.

Uniting Church general secretary Rosemary Hudson Miller said the group supported legalising cannabis for medicinal use, as long as it was prescribed by doctors under direct supervision. ""More than 20 American states, as well as many countries, including Canada, Israel, the Netherlands and Switzerland, allow the medicinal use of cannabis,"" she said. ""This was an emotional conversation, as some members of the meeting shared their personal experiences of the inadequacy of the current practice of using morphine for pain management, and the side effects of nausea and vomiting, for sufferers of chronic and terminal pain.

This was published 8 years ago In the late 1980s I spent most of my time on Ward C4 of the Prince of Wales Children’s Hospital in Randwick, Sydney. I was writing my doctorate on the psychological impact of a diagnosis and treatment of cancer on adolescents. Occasionally, some of the teenagers on the oncology ward used marijuana, often without the knowledge or permission of their treating doctors, to help with their chemotherapy-induced nausea. It was clear from discussions, that while for some it was effective – there were others for whom it seemed not to have worked as well or at all. At the time, I assumed the capricious results were due to the variable quality of street-grade cannabis.  Over the years, my benign view of cannabis began to change. Having moved away from psychosocial oncology into clinical practice as a general adolescent psychologist, it was apparent that adolescent use of cannabis was linked to a range of serious developmental and social problems. Putting aside the health concerns - notably the carcinogens and the recent claim made by one senior US physician that one cannabis joint is the equivalent of smoking 18 cigarettes - what I observed was a clear association to further drug use, lack of motivation, depression, anxiety, paranoia and psychosis. Hundreds of families with whom I have worked over the years will testify to the fact that the smoking of cannabis can and does profoundly compromise the developmental tasks of adolescence.  The medical use of cannabis was outlawed in Australia five decades ago, in an era when scientific knowledge was still embryonic. But times have changed and once again my view has had to change. Even a cursory scan of the medical literature suggests that cannabis has genuine medicinal utility, which seems to have been disregarded, with research attention in the main being directed towards the risks I observed with recreational use - rather than the benefits of its medicinal use.  A number of prestigious bodies have reviewed the evidence and all have supported its use. The American Medical Association conducted a review in 2009 and recommended rescheduling cannabinoid-based medicines to allow their legal prescription in the United States. In May 2013, a tri-partisan NSW parliamentary committee recommended making medicinal cannabis available for selected conditions. The NSW Report stated that: “…on the present medical evidence, cannabis based treatments will only be appropriate for a small number of people in specific circumstances, and under the supervision of medical practitioners with suitable expertise.” A few weeks ago, New York became the 23rd US state to allow medical marijuana in some form. Governor Andrew Cuomo  signed into legislation what he described as one of the safest, most tightly regulated medical marijuana programs in the US known as the Compassionate Care Act, which permits medical doctors to prescribe marijuana in a non-smokable form to patients with serious ailments that are recognised by the state of New York on a predefined but flexible list of conditions. To appease the anxieties of mental health professionals and law enforcement agencies, the Act includes criminal penalties in case of fraud, as well as a ""fail-safe"" mechanism allowing the Governor to ""suspend the program at any time on recommendation of either the State Police Superintendent or the Commissioner of Health if there is a risk to the public health or public safety.""  In trying to introduce something akin to the Compassionate Care Act, it seems the Victorian Premier Denis Napthine would face little opposition with almost two-thirds of Australians supporting the legalisation of cannabis for medicinal use, according to recent polls.  Last week, however, a spokesman for the state Health Minister David Davis said that for cannabis to gain approval for medical use there needed to be a strong body of scientific research that proved marijuana was more effective than other drugs. ‘‘Current evidence available strongly suggests that the balance of harms and risks does not support the use of cannabis for medicinal or recreational purposes ...’’ But the problem is that, even if Dr Napthine and other state premiers were inclined to follow New York’s lead, the proposal faces multiple obstacles. The risks associated with long-term medicinal use are less well understood, particularly the danger of dependence and any heightened risk of cardiovascular disease, so more research is needed. In addition, nothing can really happen until the Commonwealth acts to license growers, as it has done with poppies in Tasmania, so that the purity and quality of medical cannabis is assured. Second, it needs to get the Therapeutic Goods Administration to fast-track the reclassification of cannabis from illegal to being highly controlled.  Even a cursory scan of the medical literature suggests that cannabis has genuine medicinal utility, which seems to have been disregarded. Anyone who has listened to Fairfax radio talkback callers must recognise that the unauthorised use of cannabis as a medicine in Australia is extensive, suggesting substantial demand, but this use is neither supervised nor regulated. The hands of the Premiers are effectively tied, the ball is in the court of the federal Health Minister who needs to pay attention to the tsunami of common sense that seems to be sweeping the US and act.

At its annual meeting at the weekend, the WA church's synod voted in favour of changes to state law so doctors could prescribe medicinal cannabis, which would be administered under supervision. The push to legalise medical marijuana in WA is gaining momentum. Medical cannabis has a high proportion of cannabidiol, which has a range of medical benefits and a low proportion of the intoxicating tetrahydrocannabinol. Uniting Church WA acting general secretary Rosemary Hudson Miller said some attendees to the meeting shared personal experiences, describing how loved ones with chronic or terminal illnesses had found morphine inadequate for managing pain and suffered side effects such as nausea and vomiting. ""The current laws mean that family and friends choose, at some personal risk, to provide cannabis to relieve symptoms and pain, rather than watch the agony of suffering,"" she said. It was the second time the topic was raised with the government at the weekend - about 250 people called for the legalisation of medical cannabis at a rally in Perth's city centre on Sunday. Health Minister Kim Hames said there was evidence that cannabis and its extracts were beneficial in treating a range of conditions, but more research was needed. At the Labor state conference in July, Opposition leader Mark McGowan spoke about the benefits of medical cannabis for the chronically ill or dying, but stressed he was against the recreational use of marijuana. - AAP Copyright © 2023","Sep 15, 2014 ...

This was published 7 years ago Medicinal cannabis supporters are pushing forward with plans to establish a dispensary in the ACT, similar to those found in some states of the United States where the drug is freely sold from shopfronts. Launching advocacy group The Med Shed at the Hellenic Club in Woden on Sunday afternoon, group co-ordinator Matthew Holmes said a large number of pain, nausea and seizure sufferers were forced to break the law to seek relief. Despite overseas evidence of the drug's effectiveness, the medical community in Australia remained slow to accept it as a viable treatment option. Laura Bryant spoke to the group about her illness and what cannabis oil had done for her. Credit: Melissa Adams By establishing the group they wanted to take advantage of the October ACT election to pressure candidates and parties to change the law and make cannabis use legal for medical purposes in the ACT. In February the Senate passed changes to the Narcotic Drugs Act that will allow cannabis to be grown legally for the first time in decades. A national body will be established that can issue licences to growers and regulate local crops of medicinal marijuana, however possession and use remain illegal. Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley said in February that the Department of Health and the Therapeutic Goods Administration were well advanced with plans to help lower barriers that prevented cannabis access for those with a genuine medical need. But Mr Holmes said the changes were not happening fast enough, and called on ACT Justice Minister Shane Rattenbury, a supporter of medicinal cannabis use, to provide an amnesty from prosecution for those currently using the drug. ""We do think Canada has the best arrangement (for providing cannabis to patients) and we'd like the Assembly to take us to a similar model,"" Mr Holmes said. ""However, if that doesn't come about in the one-to-two-year timeframe we will take matters into our own hands and we do have the support to open a dispensary."" Twenty-one-year-old chronic pain sufferer and cannabis oil user Laura Bryant told the group that she wanted to see the dispensary opened by 2017. Ms Bryant said since deciding to go public with her own story through The Canberra Times last year she had been overwhelmed with people wanting more information and to get help. ""Eighteen months ago I would have to crawl the 12 steps from my bedroom to the toilet some days. I'm now studying nursing and paramedicine, I've moved out of home, things that no one thought I would ever be able to do. But I live in constant fear of being arrested,"" she said. Laura's mother Bernadette Bryant, who had spent years acting as her daughter's primary carer, said the group wanted to offer legal, medical and moral support to those with a need for access to cannabis. ""My life's plans never included watching my husband roll a joint for my daughter ... but this drug was life-saving and has given our family our lives back,"" she said. Mrs Bryant said the group was organising a petition to be presented to the Legislative Assembly, seeking advocates and support from across the community to attend public events. Mr Holmes said the group was also planning to establish a centre where those in need could visit once a week to meet qualified doctors and seek advice on whether cannabis might be a suitable treatment for their condition.

""By supporting and participating in these important trials with NSW, we can help the evidence building around medicinal cannabis."" Ms Hennessy said in some cases, parents were forced to choose between breaking the law and watching their child suffer. ""It is vital that we look at this issue thoroughly so that we can ensure a safe and secure supply of medicinal cannabis,"" she said. NSW Premier Mike Baird announced the three trials last December, which are expected to cost $9 million and include hundreds of people. It is understood Mr Baird discussed the trials at a meeting of state leaders in Canberra on Thursday. A spokesman for Mr Baird said NSW was ""open to extending the trial to participants in other jurisdictions"". The trial for children with severe epilepsy, who have not responded to traditional medicine, is expected to start first in NSW. It would be followed by trials for adults with terminal illness and people with nausea induced by chemotherapy. The NSW government is also instructing police not to charge adults with terminal illness who use marijuana, or their carers. It is examining options to import cannabis for the trial, or have it grown under controlled conditions by contract from the government. Health Minister Jillian Skinner has previously said the trials would not involve the use of crude cannabis which has ""serious potential ill-health effects… this is about looking at derivatives of cannabis that can be useful in treating these conditions"". A NSW Health spokeswoman said it had identified several research groups that could conduct clinical research in two areas: chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting that is resistant to standard treatment, and symptom control in palliative care. The Sydney Children's Hospital Network is working to establish the epilepsy trial. South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill​ said his state supported the NSW trials and ""looks forward to considering the results"". The office of Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk did not respond to request for comment. ​Ms Hennessy said the Victorian government has already commenced work to legalise medicinal cannabis for use in exceptional circumstances in Victoria.  It has also asked the Victorian Law Reform Commission for advice by the end of August on how the law can be changed to legalise and regulate the use of medical cannabis so it can be used to treat people with terminal or life-threatening conditions.

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 9 years ago Several recent issues have injected new life into the Australian debate about the legalisation of cannabis  for medical purposes. In December the Medical Journal of Australia published a paper calling for legal reforms to permit the medical prescribing of cannabis for certain patients. “A civilised and compassionate country that supports evidence-based medicine and policy should acknowledge that medicinal cannabis is acceptably effective and safe, and probably also cost-effective”, the authors wrote. Netherlands, Israel, Canada and Spain have  decriminalised cannabis for medical purposes, along with 20 US states. This paper followed a report last May  from a NSW cross-party parliamentary committee which unanimously recommended allowing the medical use of cannabis by patients who are terminally ill and who have AIDS.  Growing and using cannabis is  illegal in Australia. Its medical use was banned about 50 years ago when scientific knowledge about its efficacy was meagre. Now there is considerable evidence of its efficacy in providing pain relief, appetite stimulation, controlling chemotherapy-induced nausea, and alleviating symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis and some other neurological conditions causing spasticity. The unauthorised use of cannabis as a medicine in Australia is widespread, suggesting significant demand, but this use is neither supervised nor regulated and many patients in need struggle to find a suitable source. People with cancer have gone to jail for growing marijuana for their own use. In failing to address this need Australia is lagging behind a number of countries which have decriminalised cannabis for medical purposes, including the Netherlands, Israel, Canada and Spain. In the US 20 states have done likewise. Public support in Australia for the medical use of cannabis is high; a survey conducted by the Commonwealth Department of Health found 69 per cent of the public supported the use of medical cannabis and 75 per cent supported more research into the medical potential of the drug. There is, of course, a case to be made against legalisation, even if only for medical use. There is some evidence of a link between cannabis use and psychiatric disorders, there is the possibility of addiction and dependence, and there are concerns about public and workplace safety. Interestingly, traffic fatalities have decreased slightly in those American states with medical cannabis programs. Those who are concerned about drug diversion and increasing the availability of a recreational drug argue that  access to  synthetic cannabinoid drugs makes legalising cannabis for medical reasons unnecessary. The potential drawbacks can be minimised or overcome by measures including the close medical supervision of patients, the creation of appropriate dispensaries and the introduction of laws, policies and penalties that support patients but minimise public risks.  While for many in Australia the medical use of cannabis is a bridge too far, in the US both Colorado and Washington have recently legalised its recreational use. In the first month of sales in January, Colorado collected a total of $US3.5 million in taxes from sales for medical and recreational uses. The money is earmarked for youth prevention services, substance abuse treatment and public health. Business and public awareness are burgeoning. There are now more marijuana dispensaries in Denver than there are Starbucks, a fact that dismays senior officials at the US Drug Enforcement Administration, who believe that legalising cannabis is “reckless and irresponsible”. However, a number of other states are ready to act to decriminalise the drug, looking to these measures to help boost struggling government budgets by attracting tourism dollars and tax revenue. Australians should expect to hear more on this issue imminently. The legalisation of cannabis is shaping as a key issue in the rerun Senate election in Western Australia. Voting preference experts have identified Help End Marijuana Prohibition (HEMP), a micro party with 6000 members, as having the best chance of success among the minor party alliance. The HEMP party has abandoned preference deals it had with the WA Greens at the September election on the basis that the Greens backed out of a promise to host a drug summit in Canberra in return for preferences. Preference deal experts agree that of all the micro parties, HEMP is best placed to rise from obscurity and it has a chance of winning a Senate seat on April 5.

A cross-party senate group has recommended introducing a medicinal cannabis regulator that would oversee production and usage, as well as addressing the treaty.  Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley said the Abbott government was closely considering the senate inquiry's findings into the bill from Greens Leader Richard Di Natale to introduce a regulator. ""This government is incredibly sympathetic to the suffering of those Australians with debilitating chronic pain and illnesses and we want to ensure they get access to the most effective medical treatments available,"" Ms Ley said.

Senator Di Natale seized on Friday's news to renew the push for his bill to be passed. ""This issue is about getting medicine to people who need it, to ease pain and suffering, and we need to legislate a federal framework so the states can get on with rolling this out in a uniform way,"" he said.

Her supply of cannabis oil she received legally while living in Sydney ran out two days ago and she is now back to using black market cannabis. She has called every doctor and clinic in Canberra she could think of but no one is able to help. The Legislative Assembly is currently debating Labor's bill that would see possession of small amounts - up to 50 grams - of cannabis legalised. The Greens want to add amendments to the bill that would see people who use black market cannabis medicinally, but not through a prescription, allowed to possess a larger quantity legally. People would have to be able to show they had a prescribed medical condition. Greens spokesperson for drug law reform Shane Rattenbury said the changes were needed because of the difficulties in accessing ACT's medicinal cannabis scheme. He also wants to see changes to federal laws which restrict patients' access to the scheme. Mr Rattenbury said the multiple layers of approval through both ACT Health and the TGA and difficulties finding an authorised doctor meant many patients simply gave up. “That’s why we’ll be seeking to increase the allowable amount for possession for people who use cannabis medicinally to recognise that people with a medical need may need to stockpile larger quantities than recreational users and the current avenues for accessing it under prescription are overly restrictive,"" he said. “We’re also proposing the establishment of an independent cannabis advisory council to provide expertise to government on new issues that are likely to emerge as these changes come into effect.""

""The medication was approved and yet there are still these enormous hurdles that need to be negotiated.""

He wants to see a focus on better access to regulated medicinal cannabis instead. ""I can understand the motivation behind it and I have some sympathy for that motivation, but it's a consequence of wider and broader failings with the scheme,"" Dr Caldicott said.

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 6 years ago Australians are the world's heaviest users of marijuana, sharing that honour with the citizens of New Zealand and the United States. It's a kind of a pot-equivalent of the ANZUS treaty. We seem to have a lot of experience with marijuana, so it surprises me that Australia has lagged behind other similar countries when it comes to so-called 'medical marijuana'. Catch-up we seem to be doing, though, with the ACT Government recently announcing a scheme for medical marijuana. The plan is to ""establish the ACT as a leader in the research and development of cannabis products … and develop a framework for the prescription, use and distribution of medicinal cannabis to those who need them on medical grounds"". The big problem is that medical researchers are not actually clear about who actually needs 'medical marijuana', and that many doctors are anxious about prescribing such products. Dr Steve Robson is the president of the Canberra branch of the AMA. Credit: Jamila Toderas Doctors are very used to prescribing medications supported by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (the PBS) for their patients, and detailed prescribing information is available to help determine choice and dose. Canada is a very similar country to Australia, and trials of 'medical marijuana' have been under way there for a couple of years now. Yet while Canadian doctors generally express cautious support for such use, they are reluctant to prescribe it. It is likely that much of this reluctance results from lack of research into 'medical marijuana', and a paucity of clear guidance. These are issues that the ACT Government wants to address, but how successful they will be I am rather sceptical about. This is because 'medical marijuana' is not a single product. Indeed, it is very difficult to study because there are up to 60 different active molecules that could have effects. No medical trial would involve giving a patient 60 different tablets and hoping for the best! Before a new medication can be approved for patient use, pharmaceutical companies have to provide detailed information about toxicity and safety. Data about the way a molecule is metabolised in the body in different patients, and potential interactions with other medications are all critical to ensure safe use. In Australia, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) assesses this information and approves the information about prescribing that is provided to doctors.  There are a number of reasons that 'medical marijuana' has not yet gone through such processes and trials. The fact that use has been illegal certainly proved a strong barrier, but also there would be little financial reward for a pharmaceutical company to pursue the trials as there would be no profitable patent at the end. Much of the drive for increasing access to medical marijuana has come with the advent of social media, which thrives on anecdotes. The thought that an easily-grown substance might be life-changing for sufferers of chronic pain, end-stage cancers, or terrible conditions such as childhood epilepsy is very enticing. Unfortunately, the evidence we have at the moment has not convinced many clinicians. In particular, trials in children need to balance short-term effectiveness with the risk of longer-term adverse effects on a child's developing brain. A thorough review of the available evidence for 'medical marijuana' was published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The review concluded that the evidence for many claims was weak, and that there was a risk of serious adverse effects. These findings worry doctors, who want to offer the best to the patients they care for. Community concerns typically centre around 'medical marijuana' trials becoming a Trojan horse, a politically-acceptable way for cannabis enthusiasts to get a 'foot in the door' for their favourite illicit drug to be legalised. This concern is not necessarily supported, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) reports showing that the legal status of cannabis does not seem to have any effect on community usage. It seems that lots of issues have to be sorted out before 'medical marijuana' goes mainstream.  Doctors are hungry to find effective new treatments for their patients. Medications such as opiates (morphine, for example) are obviously plant-derived and good manufacturing practice (GMP) frameworks are in place to minimise batch variation and thus improve patient safety. These established systems might inform development with 'medical marijuana'. Thalidomide provides an excellent example of how a drug can be introduced into use and cause unanticipated harms and misery. Doctors are always wary of these experiences, and join the community in expecting the highest standards of care. Our motto is, 'First do no harm'. That is the touchstone of medical practice. Hopefully, in time, we will know whether marijuana-derived pharmaceuticals actually benefit very vulnerable members of our community. If, and only if, the promise of 'medical marijuana' that enthusiasts claim is ultimately proven, then cannabinoids will take their place in the long list of proven therapies. Doctors will then prescribe them, and patients will benefit. Marijuana won't be an alternative medicine, it will just be medicine. In the meantime, don't expect too much to change.

This was published 2 years ago HIF has become the first major private health insurer to publicly declare support for medical cannabis and one of the first to offer rebates for the treatments under their extras policies.

Under HIF's changes, customers who subscribe to its pharmacy drugs extras scheme can claim a maximum rebate of $80 per script or $105 if they are prescribed products from WA medical cannabis producer Little Green Pharma. “As a member-based health fund, our community is the motivation for everything we do, soassisting members through treatment options that can dramatically improve quality of lifeacross different life stages is a key focus,"" HIF chief executive Justin James said. ""Supporting members with medical cannabis as a treatment option is another choice we are excited to provide to members.” Mr James said global research into medical cannabis was showing promise and he would support more research being undertaken in Australia. Last year the Grattan Institute warned the private health insurance sector was in a ""death spiral"" as younger people questioning the value of it dumped their policies. Post-COVID membership numbers have improved but less than half of Australians have private cover according to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. Private Healthcare Australia chief executive officer Dr Rachel David said HIF's announcement demonstrated the sector's nimbleness compared to the government when it came to emerging medications. ""Health funds are primarily focused on the needs of their members and we do have the history of responding more quickly to consumer concerns and demands than maybe the government can,"" she said.

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 5 years ago  When The Hydroponics Company - which trades under the ASX ticker: THC - announced that its former chairman, Alan Beasley, was attempting to purge the rest of the board, CBD's first reaction was that he might have been using a bit too much of the company’s product. Especially when we saw that this THC director owned less than 1 per cent of the company, which has risen four-fold since its ASX debut last May. THC is a medicinal cannabis player and Beasley’s interest dates back more than a decade. Beasley, the former BNP Paribas country head, ex Goldman Sachs executive - and Liberal Party operator - was clearly miffed with his removal as THC’s chairman last October. This was just months after the former investment banker did the heavy-lifting in getting the pot stock listed. He even attempted to time its float for April 20. For non pot-heads, it's a nod to the number 420 which has become a pop culture reference for marijuana. In the US, April 20 has become a much celebrated day to … inhale.But let’s be clear, his motives are pure. THC is a medicinal cannabis player and Beasley’s interest dates back more than a decade when he started researching the medicinal benefits of cannabis. And now, back to Beasley's scheme for THC domination. Illustration: John Shakespeare As Beasley’s fellow directors noted in THC’s release to the ASX on Tuesday, the shareholder meeting notice has been issued by Beasley in his capacity as a company director but “it was not authorised, and is not supported, by the company or the majority of directors of the company.” They also promise a “compete rebuttal of the various allegations and representations made” (we think they mean complete) in the coming days. But what were the heinous allegations that Beasley is using to justify the board purge and installation of two new directors of his choosing: Pharmacy industry executive, Lou Cattelan, and Gold Coast barrister Gary Radcliff. “I am concerned with THC’s governance and approach under the majority of the current board. It is my duty to ensure that THC, as a listed company, adheres to the highest level of corporate governance.” Uh huh.He also wants to ensure the company “consistently operates on the highest level of transparency” and makes “timely and balanced disclosure of all material information.”CBD attempted to get hold of Beasley for further clarification, given this notice has all the clout of a wet lettuce leaf.It may or may not be a coincidence that the man who replaced Beasley as THC chairman, Ian Mutton, served on the board of commercial property tiddler, Hudson Investment Group, untill August last year. Beasley is the managing director of Hudson. When banks are grumbling about the slow-growth world they find themselves in, you might think a 10 per cent growth in profit to a new record is pretty good. But at Macquarie Group, which revealed this outlook in a profit upgrade on Tuesday, its boss, Nic Moore, gave the outlook a tepid ""satisfactory"" rating. Morgan Stanley's Richard Wiles queried Moore on what it would take for the bank to get a little more excited about its earnings outlook. ""Nicholas, why are you describing the conditions in the quarter as satisfactory?"" After all, Shemara Wikramanayake's asset management business was raking in higher fees, its investment banking unit Macquarie Capital had a ""strong"" three months, and things also improved in its banking and financial services arm. ""What do we need to get for you to describe the conditions as better than satisfactory?"" asked Wiles, to laughter from other analysts. Moore played a straight bat. ""I think we all would agree it's satisfactory,"" he said, also getting a few laughs. Global sharemarkets may have been in meltdown, but don’t be surprised if there were a few chuckles across the ditch. Former Kiwi corporate hero, Xero, really chose the wrong day to make its ASX debut. The software group, which raised a furore across the ditch with its plans to decamp to the ASX, watched its stock drop as much as 5.5 per cent in early trading. The impending bloodbath may have got the better of Xero CEO, Rod Dury, who managed to break the ASX bell while ringing in the software group’s market debut in the morning. Didn’t anybody tell Dury that he gets to keep the rope anyway? It is a tradition that began in November 2013, when Matt Barrie bounced in to ASX headquarters to ring the ceremonial bell for Freelancer.com's listing. He rang it with such vigour that he broke the rope and was subsequently given it as a souvenir. Speaking of carnage, CBD is sure that it was the market turmoil that caused the precipitous drop in Magellan Financial’s share price. Surely it was nothing to with its announcement that its global stock guru, Hamish Douglass, was doing an about-face and splashing millions of its stock on Airlie - the home of local stock picking legends John Sevior and Matt Williams.

Her case was on Wednesday adjourned in the Beenleigh Magistrates Court until February 26, pending the outcome of a Supreme Court appeal that could have implications for her case. That appeal by Alex Dimitropoulos is against convictions for producing and possessing dangerous drugs and publishing or possessing instructions. Lynch, who is president of the Medicinal Users Association of Australia, pleaded not guilty to the charges against her during a previous court appearance. Lynch says she was nearly 30 years old when she first used cannabis after a back injury, weaning herself off an addictive prescription drug that had enabled her to sleep. Lynch suffers from a rare, painful and terminal auto-immune disease that led to her having her leg amputated, diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, insomnia and panic attacks. She tried unsuccessfully to get a prescription for medical cannabis in 2014. More recently doctors told her to go to a cannabis clinic where an initial consultation would cost more than $200. Ms Lynch said legal cannabis supply for medical conditions can cost $3500 a week, which was unaffordable for many. Lynch says she'll fight for legalisation so people who need the drug for medical reasons can grow their own or get it through co-operatives. She had letters from doctors saying she had been using cannabis successfully for years when she was arrested and taken to the police station in the back of a paddy wagon.

As the physical and mental stress take its toll, heavy medication is your final resort to cope, so your body shuts down in an exhausted heap, only for your brain to continue enduring sporadic spasms while your body desperately tries to regain its much-needed strength. Amalie and her devoted parents Renae and Frank. This nightmare is a tumultuous reality for four-year-old Perth girl Amalie Telo, who was born with the rare brain malformation disorder lissencephaly, literally translating to ""smooth brain"". This life-limiting condition has caused Amalie to have epilepsy, global development delays, cortical visual impairment and feeding difficulties, amongst other issues. She requires constant support from medical teams, allied health care, and most importantly, her devoted parents Renae and Frank. Amalie's family hopes medicinal cannabis may offer some kind of relief.Credit: Uriel Sinai It is highly unlikely she will ever be able to walk, speak, feed herself or independently care for herself for the remainder of her life. ""Infantile spasms"", a particular type of seizure that Amalie experiences, have resulted in regression of some of the few skills she has learnt. Medicinal cannabis may be her only foreseeable option to improve her quality of daily life. ""From day one of diagnosis she was put on an anti-epileptic medication and she has been on that one the entire time, but with dosage changes, different combinations, meds being added and taken away,"" Renae says. ""For a little period she was seizure-free but then developed them again."" Amalie experiences countless seizures each day of varying degrees. Renae suspects some are minor enough to go unnoticed, however others are so severe they require emergency drugs that knock her out for several hours at a time. Amalie experiences countless seizures each day of varying degree. ""It could be a 15-second drop seizure where she loses muscle tone and her head will fall and her limbs will drop, she might have short moments of eyes flickering. They can last anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes,"" Renae explains. ""Anything longer than a five-minute seizure, we have to give her what we call 'rescue medication' to help bring her out of the seizure. They're like a sedative so they slow everything down. She's non-mobile and non-verbal, so I have no idea how it affects her."" Perth mother Kylie* administers an oral capsule form of medicinal cannabis to her four-year-old son Joseph* who suffers from Dravet Syndrome, an extreme form of epilepsy. Prior to using this therapy he was having major seizures at least once every 10 days. ""When he seizes he goes into what they call a status seizure, which is anything over 20 minutes,"" she explains. ""The last seizure he had, he seized for seven hours. They have a whole protocol of drugs that they go through, but they ended up having to put him in a coma and put him in ICU on a ventilator to try to stop it. ""The first time he used medicinal marijuana he was 18 months old and went six months seizure-free. He started talking in sentences, and he started going from a fairly unsteady walk into a strong walk, and then started running."" Kylie says the drug needs to be regulated so its effectiveness can be accurately assessed. ""His quality of life has gotten a lot better, his communication has gotten better, he's able to tolerate things a lot more,"" she says. ""But it needs to be legalised so we know its consistency, so it's a pure drug, so we know there aren't any other chemicals in there and know it was processed the right way. It would take the fear out of that and it would take the fear out of getting in trouble about it."" Chief executive officer of the Epilepsy Association of WA, Suresh Rajan, says of the 24,500 West Australians with epilepsy, some 7500 have an uncontrolled type. He estimates 10 per cent of those illegally use marijuana in some form. ""Anecdotally, I have people who have gone from 300 seizures a day down to 200 or 300 days seizure free,"" Mr Rajan says. ""This is significant improvement."" Legislation allowing for medicinal cannabis in Australia was passed through Federal Parliament in February 2016. Under the new scheme, patients with a valid medical prescription can possess and use marijuana products manufactured from marijuana legally grown in Australia, provided the supply has been authorised under the Therapeutic Goods Act and relevant state laws. The next step is conducting clinical trials to determine which of the 48 different types of epilepsy it affects, which of the patent medications it can replace and what side effects can occur. According to Amalie's neurologist, she should take part in a trial when one comes to Perth. ""We'd love for it to happen,"" Renae says. ""It all depends on when it comes on board. We've been waiting for quite some time and trialling different medications and dosages, which have had no effect on the number of seizures or the length of seizures that she's having. ""Some of them can have extreme side effects like deadly rash, swelling of the face and lips, muscle weakness, kidney and liver disease, bone volume reduction, behavioural issues, and depression and suicidal thoughts. Those worry me because she can't tell me how she's feeling."" Renae says the benefits of medical marijuana could be life changing for Amalie and her family. ""It would be so much better. It would probably affect her sleep patterns, which in turn would mean I get a good night's sleep,"" she said. ""Since she was born I haven't had a full nights sleep – I'm constantly watching her on a video monitor and listening out for noises. ""We're not oblivious to the fact that medical marijuana may not be the answer, but if it does it would open up a whole new world of different possibilities for her so it's important to try.

This was published 7 years ago A Queensland father charged with supplying his sick daughter with cannabis oil was unlikely to get amnesty, despite the Premier citing the plight of children as a key motivator to sign the state up for a trial of medicinal cannabis. Annastascia Palaszczuk and Health Minister Cameron Dick confirmed on Sunday that Queensland would join New South Wales and Victoria in trialling cannabis oil on patients suffering epilepsy, end-of-life pain and chemotherapy-related nausea. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has announced medicinal cannabis trials will be conducted in Queensland.  Ms Palaszczuk said NSW Premier Mike Baird's announcement of the groundbreaking $9 million trial last December sparked an influx of pleas for a similar program here. ""When you hear the story from these families, when you hear what they are going through on a daily basis - young children with epilepsy, life-threatening seizures,"" she said. ""We as a community must ensure we do everything we can to ensure these children are not going through pain, and being a part of that trial is the first step in alleviating that pain."" Health Minister Cameron Dick said the trial was being led by New South Wales, but he envisioned the clinical work happening this year. ""I want to ensure the clinical work we do in Queensland complements what's happening in New South Wales and Victoria,"" he said. ""We will work on this very quickly and try to get it done as soon as possible, but I'll defer to experts in the area."" He said Queensland would contribute to the $9 million cost, but to what extent was being discussed. A Cairns father was arrested in January after allegedly supplying cannabis oil to his two-year-old daughter suffering neuroblastoma. She is being treated aggressively with chemotherapy in a Brisbane hospital and the father, who can't be named for legal reasons, said the oil alleviated the side-effects. He is facing charges of supplying dangerous drugs to a minor and possessing dangerous drugs, and is currently raising funds to pay for legal and living costs. The father'ss support team - whose comments he endorses - posted on his Facebook page that they welcomed the news, but said a trial could waste time. ""These trials have been done extensively in other countries and rather than making people wait years for the results of Australian trials, people should be given the right to choose their own treatment without fear of prosecution,"" read the post. ""So many people already know that medical cannabis can save lives and improve quality of life alongside conventional treatments. This is a wonderful start but this is far from adequate. ""People who choose to educate themselves and use medical cannabis products should be given amnesty from prosecution while these trials are conducted."" Ms Palaszczuk wouldn't say if the father would receive amnesty, but suggested others in future wouldn't face drug charges. ""My understanding is in New South Wales, those families that are participating will receive an exemption,"" she said. ""So we'll get the finer details of the legislative framework down over the next couple of weeks to months, but today is the first step."" Ms Palaszczuk and Mr Dick also received their annual flu shot on Sunday, with 135,000 doses of the newly updated vaccine.

This was published 8 years ago The only way to protect people from questionable black market marijuana is to regulate the supply of medicinal forms of the drug that can be prescribed to suitable people, doctors say. President of the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation and addiction medicine specialist Dr Alex Wodak said given it was impossible for people to know what they were getting when they purchased cannabis on the black market in Australia, the only solution was for the government to create a controlled ""white market"". Dr Alex Wodak will lead the pilot pill-testing program.Credit: Stefan Postles ""A safe source of medicines is really one of the fundamental tools of public health along with a safe water supply, a safe food supply and safe air to breathe,"" he said. ""In my view, medicinal cannabis should be regulated by the regulators just like penicillin and insulin are."" While governments could choose not to prosecute people for possessing and using black market cannabis for the treatment of medical illness, Dr Wodak said this would not do anything to protect people from snake oil salesmen or forms of the drug that are unsuitable for them.   He said the best way for governments to provide safe access was for the department of health to contract a company to produce high-grade botanical cannabis that is protected from contaminants. It could then be packaged like other medicines and prescribed to people for inhalation through a vaporiser.  ""The least worst way of taking leaf cannabis is by heating it to sub-combustible temperatures - that is, below the temperature at which the leaf burns - and inhaling the vapour, not the smoke. We have technology that allows that to happen,"" he said.  Dr Wodak said this would allow people to inhale a sufficient dose to reduce their symptoms to a tolerable level without getting unwanted side effects. Dr David Allsop, a research fellow in psychopharmacology and addiction medicine at the University of Sydney, said governments should take control of cannabis production, either by contracting a company to produce it or by importing it from countries like the Netherlands where it is available on prescription. He said there was enough scientific evidence to show that it was a useful treatment for people with rheumatoid arthritis, cancer and neuropathic pain - pain that stems from injuries to the nervous system. ""There's a whole range of things that cannabis is potentially useful for, even as an anxiety treatment in low doses,"" he said. ""There are clinical studies showing that it is beneficial to people with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). It alleviates nightmares, sleeplessness and recurrent flashbacks of traumatic events.""  While three pharmaceutical cannabis products have been developed, only one of them - Sativex - has been approved for use by the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia to treat multiple sclerosis. Some Australian cancer patients are also part of a global trial of Sativex to see if it relieves difficult-to-treat cancer pain, and it is being tested overseas on people with epilepsy.  Dr Wodak and Dr Allsop said it was extremely unlikely that Australian doctors would prescribe this drug to people who do not have multiple scleroris because it is a highly regulated ""schedule 8"" drug, putting it in the same category as opioids such as methadone.  They said until governments created a safe supply for prescription, the unreliable black market would continue to thrive.

Tasmanian Minister for Health Michael Ferguson told Fairfax Media that CBD is due to be classed as schedule 4 (prescription-only medicine) from June 1, 2015, and that there is currently only one application pending to grow and develop high-CBD hemp cultivars in the state.

Credit: Anthony Johnson Unlike the better-known Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), CBD has no psychotropic properties. Tasmania is collaborating with clinical trials under way in NSW to test the efficacy of the CBD-based treatments. Advocates tout it is as a potential treatment for conditions including epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory diseases.  The potential market is huge and Tasmania is ideally placed to be at the forefront of profiting from it, Ms Nicoletti said.  ""Tasmanian policymakers are behind the push, and the state's international reputation for being clean and green helps speak to quality assurance.""  Ms Nicoletti said Tasmania also had the advantage of having established material grade hemp and controlled pharmaceutical-grade opium production industries in the state, which meant there was a template for many of the new regulatory frameworks required.  Mr Ferguson has echoed Tasmanian Premier Will Hodgman, speaking out in support of allowing the development of a medicinal cannabis industry in the state.  ""The reclassification of cannabidiol to a different schedule has taken place away from political considerations.  This serves as a reminder of the ongoing need for the science-based approach that drives the way we regulate medicines in order to benefit from scientific advances and to keep people safe. The Tasmanian government is committed to a collaborative approach to clinical trials with other states and territories,"" he said.  The Cannabinoid Extracts Australia deal rounds out to three the roll-up of Cannabis company acquisitions that BBY executive director Adam Blumenthal has helped the Capital Mining board assemble. Once regulatory approvals are granted, Cannabinoid Extracts Australia expects to plant a crop in the second half of 2015, with initial annual production forecast at about 1000 kilos. Internationally, CBD typically sells for between $US50,000 to $US70,000 ($65,000 to $92,000) a kilo.  Capital Mining is expected to hold a shareholder meeting in about five weeks to take the new strategy and yet-to-be unveiled name change to a vote.  Mr Blumenthal said the Capital Mining board was excited to be at the forefront of developing the domestic medicinal cannabis industry.  Correction: An earlier version stated that CBD typically sells for between $US50 to $US70 ($65 to $92) a kilo, this has been corrected to read $US50,000 to $US70,000 ($65,000 to $92,000) a kilo.

This was published 1 year ago When the pain from his cancer got too great and the pain medication made him argumentative and fuzzy, Kevin Jocumsen told his wife he was planning to walk in front of a bus. His family intervened and just a few weeks later he was part of a clinical trial for a cannabis-derived treatment that would go on to completely change his quality of life. Kevin Jocumsen with wife Leeanne. Mr Jocumsen was diagnosed with prostate cancer 13 years ago and doctors believed they had tackled it with surgery, but it returned eight years later. This time the treatment only managed to keep the cancer at bay, and the 66-year-old was forced to go on strong pain medication on an ongoing basis. The meds kept the pain at bay, he said, but they also altered his personality. The first prescription left him vague and tired, while the second caused violent mood swings. “During that period, my mental health suffered, with depression and anxiety. With the pain that was associated with it, I wasn’t in a really good place,” he said. Professor Janet Hardy is conducting a major trial of pain treatments derived from cannabis.Credit: Mater His wife, Leeanne, said things reached their darkest point one day after several months of treatment and pain medication. “He came out and said ‘I’m done, I’m going to find a bus and walk in front of it’, and I realised things had got really bad,” she said. Mr Jocumsen’s family helped him through the following few days, and then they approached his doctor about alternatives. “I said, ‘we can’t keep using these medications, but without them, it’s not bearable, his emotions are all over the place’,” Leeanne said. Mr Jocumsen’s doctor was Professor Janet Hardy, Mater’s director of palliative and supportive care, who coincidentally was running a clinical trial of a cannabis-derived treatment for cancer sufferers. Cannabis-derived medications have received a lot of attention in recent years, with public support growing to make various extracts legal for use in a medical context. However there has not been a lot of actual medical research, until very recently, to confirm exactly what the benefits of cannabis extracts are. “CBD and THC are the most common cannabinoids, but we don’t know what combination to give them in, what dose to give them in,” Professor Hardy said. “No one has really carefully and objectively documented the adverse event profiles.” The professor had completed a successful pilot study of a treatment using CBD, and was now embarking on a full trial of the treatment, which she invited Mr Jocumsen to join. Although the study is now only just wrapping up and neither Professor Hardy nor Mr Jocumsen know whether he got the drug or the placebo, he appeared to respond well to the treatment. “Everything was doom and gloom before the treatment, I’d burst into tears all the time and it wouldn’t take much to upset me,” he said. “Once I was on the CBD treatment, it was like coming out of a deep dark place into the light.” Professor Hardy said that was consistent with how researchers were coming to understand how CBD in particular works. Rather than having a direct pain-killing effect, it improves overall mood, enabling patients to push through. She said she hoped her study and other work being done around the world could work out the best way to use cannabis products to help patients like Mr Jocumsen. “This won’t replace morphine, but we’re hoping it might be an ancillary drug that people could take along with their morphine to help them deal with their pain,” she said. Mr Jocumsen and his wife are now planning a series of trips around the country – pandemic allowing – which he said wouldn’t have been possible without the cannabis extract treatment. “We’re going to go around Australia in a caravan; we’re planning on six to eight months,” he said. “We thought we had this beaten and then the cancer came back, so we’re going to spend as much time enjoying ourselves as we can.” Copyright © 2023","Jul 27, 2021 ...

This was published 7 years ago The arrest of a pair of self-described suppliers of medical marijuana in Carrum Downs last month carried with it a certain irony. The arrests were made because the provision of cannabis for the treatment of disease is illegal in Australia. Yet with impressive speed, this country is becoming a key jurisdiction in a burgeoning industry that is estimated to top $14 billion a year in the US by 2020, and reach $US500 billion a year globally once fully mature.

The head grower at British Columbia facility Broken Coast Cannabis where legal medical grade marijuana is grown hydroponically.Credit: Broken Coast Cannabis Mr Karelis, a private equity adviser, is a prominent player in the emerging Australian pot industry. It is an industry that, perhaps surprisingly, contains not a single hippie. Instead it is peopled by an extraordinary mix of professionals, including a Liberal parliamentarian turned avocado grower, lawyers, scientists, Canadian pharmacists, Californian and Israeli business people, Slovenian public servants and – odd, this – Australian mining company executives. There are currently three marijuana corporations listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, two of them in the guise of mining companies. The end of the minerals boom has been a blessing for international marijuana concerns in search of ready-made and respectable corporate platforms. ""In WA, there are a lot of mining companies that aren't doing much these days, but they have money in the bank, and a shareholder register,"" said one industry observer. ""It's known as a reverse takeover."" Israel-based company MGC Pharmaceuticals, for example, which makes marijuana-infused cosmetics and skincare products, has its corporate anchorage in Perth, where it inhabits Erin Resources, a mining company that used to dig for gold in Africa.

 Pending shareholder approval, California-based medical marijuana giant Nutrawerx will next month list on the ASX in the guise of Perth-based uranium explorers, Capital Mining. MGC and Nutrawerx followed the example of a third company, Phytotech Medical, which in January became the first pot company to list on the Australian exchange – and the only one to date to do so under its own name. Its head office is in Perth, but all its operations are carried out in Israel, using weed harvested in Canada and Uruguay. AusCann, privately owned, is unusual in the local dope industry because all its directors are actually Australian. Among them are Mr Karelis, and Dr Mal Washer, Liberal member for Moore until 2013, now a successful avocado grower. The company is planning to plant Australia's first legal marijuana later this year, on Norfolk Island. The corporate reality of medical marijuana is starkly different to its cosy myth. In the US, 23 states now permit sale to registered patients. TV coverage has focused on little street-level dope dispensaries, run by well-meaning folk in rainbow T-shirts, jars of buds on the counter and lovingly tended hydroponic set-ups out the back. But that's a bit like pretending your local pharmacist never gets a visit from a Pfizer rep. Despite a raft of often contradictory regulations governing pot use around the world, the industry is expansionist, aggressive, defiantly capitalist and occasionally rapacious. The boardroom talk is not of purple haze, Afghan Gold and Bob Marley, but of supply chains, margins, revenues, regulatory compliance, share offers and takeovers. Sparking up a spliff is as out of date as chewing on a poppy in search of a morphine hit. ""The key to understanding the medical marijuana industry in the future is to understand that smoking a joint is not a proper medicinal delivery technology,"" said Andreas Gedeon, president of MMJ Biosciences. Mr Gedeon was speaking to Fairfax Media from Copenhagen, where he had just arrived from Singapore, before heading back to his corporate headquarters in Vancouver. MMJ is one of the most acquisitive of the new medical marijuana companies. Gedeon's trip to Singapore had been to meet with Peter Wall, Perth-based lawyer and chair of Phytotech Medical, to discuss the fine details of a buy-out. If approved, the sale will give MMJ some new labs in Jerusalem to complement its previous purchases – a couple of quality control and dope-growing companies in Canada, and Satipharm, a Swiss production facility. Despite having no plans to operate in Australia, it will also give it a presence on the ASX. ""The ASX was a very welcoming platform [for Phytotech], and the investors were very receptive to the idea,"" said Gedeon. ""Our company slogan is 'from farm to pharma'. Lots of people have great ideas about what you can do with cannabis – but the point is you need a supply chain before you can do any of it."" The company's first product, a capsule containing an extract called CBD (from a class of non-psychoactive compounds called cannabidiols), rolled out of its Swiss arm this month. It will be marketed in Europe as a dietary supplement. CBD is a strong focus for the medical marijuana industry. There is evidence that it is effective in controlling seizures in childhood epilepsy, and may be useful in the treatment of some cancers and depression. The fact that it is non-euphoric also means regulators tend to look upon it more kindly than they do the better known stoner-compound THC. In Australia, CBD was classified this month by the Therapeutic Goods Administration as a Schedule 4 substance, removing one major hurdle to its eventual use by doctors. It also cleared the way for it to be produced in Australia, albeit under stringent conditions. This was good news for California's Nutrawerx (soon to be Perth's Capital Mining), which until recently was planning to purchase another company, Cannabinoid Extracts Australia, and plant a forest of dope plants on its holdings in Tasmania. The deal would have been good news for shareholders. On the global medical marijuana market, CBD sells for up to $AUS90,000 a kilo. The same amount of uranium sells for around 20 bucks. Last week, though, it all went pear-shaped. A vending machine that contains cannabis flower, hemp-oil energy drinks, and other merchandise at Seattle Caregivers, a medical marijuana dispensary, in Seattle.Credit: DAVID RYDER ""Unfortunately, the proposed agreement with Cannabinoid Extracts has now been rescinded,"" said Nutrawerx CEO Michael Sautman this week, citing problems with due diligence. The issue, however, is a set-back rather than an end to Mr Sautman's plans. ""Absolutely we will try again,"" he said. ""Our objective is to establish a complete supply chain for medical marijuana in Australia."" Sautman said the main obstacle to a robust medical marijuana industry in Australia is legislative. Federal law mirrors closely the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, which sets standards for global trade in mind-altering substances. Cannabis was included under the convention in 1961 – the result more of ""reefer madness"" hysteria than dispassionate research. A bill by Greens senator Richard Di Natale, now before parliament, proposes a more flexible set of regulations. Should the bill be successful – and Prime Minister Tony Abbott is on record as broadly supportive of medical marijuana – then Australia may well enjoy a pot-driven economic recovery. ""Australia is a country with amazing agricultural potential for massive grows,"" said Nativ Segev, head of Israel's MGC Pharmaceuticals, aka Erin Resources. ""It also offers opportunities in research and development that we would be remiss to ignore."" Mr Segev said his company planned to franchise operations, establishing a supply chain stretching from its patented plant varieties to its finished cosmetics in each territory. ""We can go global very quickly,"" he said. Curiously enough, Segev's company this week won the race to become the first Australian-registered company to gain permission to plant a marijuana crop. On Thursday the company informed the ASX that it had received the green light to establish a dope plantation in Slovenia. Meanwhile, over on Norfolk Island, dinkum players AusCann plan to sell their first crop of five-metre-high plants to Canada. CEO Harry Karelis, however, sees the domestic market as very significant, should the legislative barriers ever fall. ""The Canadian government estimates the medicinal market there to be worth about $1.5 billion in the next five years,"" he said. ""Australia has a population of about two-thirds of that, so you could imagine a medical market here of around $1 billon a year."" But the question that hangs over all the talk of medicines and markets is blunt: how real are the claims made for marijuana? Until recently, research into the plant's properties was illegal in most parts of the world, sufficient supplies difficult to obtain, and clinical trials impossible to organise. All the industry figures contacted for this story said they would welcome proper randomised clinical trials for medical uses. However, all also noted that such trials take several years, and that in the meantime anecdotal evidence should be a sufficient basis for doctors to make prescribing decisions. Melbourne University Medical School Professor Emeritus David  Penington also doesn't favour waiting for formal testing. He pointed out that there has never ever been an overdose death due to marijuana consumption. ""There is strong anecdotal and epidemiological evidence that it does work,"" he said. ""And it is important to use it to look after people now, while better evidence is being put together. The first responsibility of a doctor is to relieve suffering, and the evidence is very clear that it is useful for things such as relieving the severe pain of advanced cancer, and for moderating a distressing form of childhood epilepsy called Dravet syndrome."" His position, however, is not shared across the medical profession. ""Anecdotal evidence is not real evidence,"" said Dr Megan Yap, a Queensland-based consultant paediatrician and pharmacist. Dr Yap used to work in the child protection unit of the Lady Cilento Children's Hospital in Brisbane, and encountered parents using illicit marijuana products to try to control intractable childhood epilepsy of the type caused by Dravet syndrome. It spurred her to initiate a review of the medical literature concerning the treatment. Her study, published in May this year in the Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health, found most studies to be poor and unreliable. She concluded that the evidence for using marijuana products in treating epilepsy in children is scant. ""I would suggest very strongly that clinical trials are necessary,"" she told Fairfax Media. ""The anecdotal evidence is based on the use of products that are not legal. They are non-standardised formulations. You can't know whether the efficacy is the same from batch to batch, product to product."" She said she understood why desperate parents would try the treatment, but added that no doctor should prescribe it – even assuming legality – until trials had been completed. ""Some parents have children who have 50 or 60 seizures a day,"" she said. ""So you can understand why they try this method – especially when all they can find are anecdotes from other parents. But that's not evidence. It could be from any old Joe. You don't know the context."" Dr Yap's fears reflect problems arising from marijuana's increasing respectability. Evidence can be eclipsed by claims of miracle cures, and a huge surge in investment can turn the boom into a bubble. Michael Sautman from Nutrawerx thinks not, however. This is the modern marijuana industry, and the market, not the universe, will decide its fate. ""I don't think it's a bubble,"" he said. ""Because the product is genuine in terms of its effectiveness – it actually is a medicine. ""In terms of the frenzy around it now, there's been a lot of pent-up entrepreneurial interest about this for a long, long time. That entrepreneurial interest has only been able to express itself on the black market until now. More conventional business people were unable to participate. ""As we've accomplished legal reform, we've seen more and more entrepreneurial interest unleashed. Is that a bubble? No. It's ubiquitous. In every state where there is a path to market for product, there has been huge interest – not from speculators but from people who want to build value."" Although still one step away from final approval, this week AusCann began advertising jobs at its Norfolk Island cannabis farm. Successful applicants will be the first people in Australia to earn a legal wage by growing dope. They may well not be the last. And if you don't believe that, ask your stockbroker. Around 5000 years ago, Chinese Emperor Shen Nung reportedly became the first person to test the medicinal properties of marijuana. He ate it while sampling a range of plants used by shamans. The dope did him no harm. Whatever he ate next, though, the story goes, turned him green and killed him. In late May, Russian archaeologists discovered two gold bowls dating back 2400 years, caked with old dope crud. They identified them as Scythian bongs. Credit: dangerousminds.net The distinction between recreational and therapeutic uses of cannabis has not always been obvious. The plant has been subject to consumption and trade for so many millennia that even where it first originated is unknown. Best guess is central Asia. Its earliest reference in Western literature comes from the work of the historian Herodotus (490-425 BCE) who describes Scythian warriors, rulers of the steppes, chucking buds on a fire, inhaling and howling. In late May, Russian archaeologists discovered two gold bowls dating back 2400 years, caked with old dope crud. They identified them as Scythian bongs. By the time of Herodotus, cannabis use was already ancient and widespread. Relics date its use to 10,000BC in Taiwan. The Indian and Nepalese Hindu text Artharva Veda, around 2000BC, calls it a sacred plant. Zoroastrian texts from 700BC list it as medicinal. Copyright © 2023","Jun 11, 2015 ...

This was published 7 years ago The debate about the status of medicinal marijuana in WA has taken another turn - with Health Minister Kim Hames writing to a frustrated Perth mum to say it can be prescribed but the substance itself is proving inaccessible. Amalia's 10-year-old daughter suffers from a rare and severe form of epilepsy known as Dravet Syndrome and has been hospitalised since Saturday night after a seizure. CBD was effectively legalised in WA from June 1 but is yet to be approved by the TGA. She has tried 23 forms of traditional drugs without great success - and is currently on a combination of four - and Amalia was keen to trial the use of the compound cannabidiol (CBD).

An extract from the letter from Health Minister Kim Hames to Perth mum Amalia. But joy turned to frustration when she realised it was effectively unobtainable because no CBD product was yet approved for sale by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. ""I was thrilled, I was jumping up and down and thinking 'here we go',"" Amalia told Radio 6PR's Mornings program. ""I was very excited to see [Dr Hames] had said it is possible to prescribe but there are still many steps to access it. Unfortunately our doctor says he is unable to access it. ""There have been many reports on the internet about families in exactly the same situation and seeing fantastic results - a much better quality of life. We'd like to trial it."" WA Health Minister Kim Hames told Radio 6PR on Tuesday morning doctors could prescribe the oil to their patients if they could get access to it. ""We put in an application with New South Wales back in October to the TGA to get approval for the use of the oil, and that was approved and that's what is available from 2015,"" he said. ""But the trouble then is, you have to have a product you can buy so any doctor is able to use the product... it's the matter of getting access to it. And the TGA have yet to have a company come forward with a product that has been approved by the TGA. So we are in a catch 22 and nobody is able to use it. ""Now there is a drug I understand is being manufactured and is going through a process to get that approval but it hasn't been approved yet."" Dr Hames warned people not to give their sick kids unrefined cannabis. ""It is frustrating, but there are people out there with children that have tried to use cannabis in some form on their own and there is no evidence to suggest that its made a difference to their child's epilepsy,"" he said. ""There is some confusion.... people think lets just use some cannabis, but it's the chemical compound that is important,"" he said. ""The oil contains no THC, so that's the stuff that gives you a high - all of that drug component is taken out."" Labor spokesman for health, Roger Cook, said Dr Hames sending the letter to the family was ""cruel"".  ""It has given false hope to patients around WA,"" he said. ""WA should be participating in the trials with New South Wales."" The status of medicinal marijuana in WA has been the source of considerable discussion over the past 18 months.

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 8 years ago In the United States - where President Nixon started the war on drugs more than 40 years ago - there are close to 30 states where medical marijuana is legal and two states where it is fully legal.  Three states will vote on legalisation at the upcoming mid-term elections. Yet concurrently its use is responsible for a large number of people being in jail. Medical cannabis extract. Research has shown that the impact on a child of a parent being jailed is as bad or worse than death of a parent. So locking people up because they have a particular choice of favorite substance is not only more harmful to the person than the substance but harms any children they have as well. Yet it was not always so. Until the 1940s, cannabis was seen as having medicinal properties and was legal for all until the early part of the 20th century. Concerns about its potential for addiction led to it being less often prescribed and ultimately made illegal. Medical marijuana, the debate continues.  Locally, the WA AMA is arguing publicly that we need more research and that medical marijuana is dangerous. To support their case they say, correctly, that there is no evidence for its use in glaucoma and asthma. They make little mention of the two biggest [current and historical] uses for medical marijuana, which are pain and nausea. For many people it is effective in treating this. One argument against its use is that we can treat these problems by other means. And therein lies the rub. Use of prescription opiate painkillers has led to major problems with addiction and there are far more deaths associated with these than with illicit substances. Nausea treatment is not always effective so another option would be useful. Critics, including the AMA, are silent on this. And here is a critical point. It is almost impossible to overdose and kill yourself with marijuana. Dr Joe Kosterich The other problem with opiate painkillers is that people develop tolerance and then the dose needs to be increased - contributing to overdose and deaths. So the legal option may be less effective and is certainly more dangerous than the illegal alternative. A survey of overdose deaths from opiates saw a four-fold increase in the US between 1999 and 2010. Yet there was up to a 30 per cent reduction in deaths in states with legalised medical marijuana. Maybe that is pure coincidence - but I doubt it. If people are using marijuana instead of opiates we will see less deaths, as it is a non-toxic or fatal substance, whereas opiates are toxic and dangerous. Does this really make sense? Is it logical? And when it comes to nausea, especially in those with cancer, currently used drugs are not always that effective either. Another option would be helpful. So yes, I am also in favour of medical marijuana as the benefits significantly outweigh the risks. If you are wondering if the medical use would be a backdoor for some increase in the overall use - the answer is yes. We have already seen that in the US and the same would happen here, at least initially. The fundamental issue is that when we strip out current legalities and simply look at substances, marijuana is far from the worst drug we have and is safer than many prescription drugs. And, yes, it can cause addiction in some and yes, some who use it may also use harder drugs - but the vast majority of people do not. For them the legal consequences of use are far worse than the health ones. So whom are we protecting? As a father with teenagers, I don't want them using drugs. But getting arrested would be far more harmful. As President Carter opined, our policies on drugs should at the least be no more damaging for the individual than the usage of the drug. Currently we fail that simple test. We need to do better. More of the same is not the answer. Dr Joe Kosterich can be heard regularly on 6PR Drive with Paul Murray.

NSW Premier Mike Baird first started talking about the potential of medical cannabis, or marijuana, for the treatment of the terminally ill late last year. His interest soon solidified to become three separate trials of medical cannabis, at a cost of $9 million during five years. The first trial, which is expected to begin next year, will assess the value of cannabis to relieve the seizures endured by children with severe epilepsy. That trial will be followed by a trial of the efficacy of cannabis to improve the quality of life for people with terminal illness by reducing their pain and nausea. A third trial will assess the use of cannabis for patients enduring the discomfort associated with chemotherapy. The Australian Medical Association agrees with the NSW government in saying the evidence in favour of medical cannabis is patchy and more trials are needed. The results of these trials will take some time to come through. As they now stand, the trials will not look at the value of cannabis for the treatment of many of the other conditions the drug has been said to alleviate, including, among others, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, Parkinson's disease, migraines, Crohn's disease, and spinal cord injury and disease. Although 23 states in the US, Canada and some  nations in Europe have now approved the use of medical cannabis, the Australian Medical Association agrees with the NSW government in saying the evidence in favour of medical cannabis is patchy and more trials are needed. Mr Foley, for his part, says the government should press ahead more quickly to enable medical cannabis to be accessed by ailing patients who need it, without waiting for the trials to be completed and the results to be assessed. He raises the spectre of patients in pain being denied a drug that could provide them with some relief. However, the NSW government has issued guidelines to ensure that police officers have the discretion to turn a blind eye to patients, and their carers, who are caught using or purchasing cannabis to alleviate pain and discomfort. A ""cannabis cautioning scheme"" has been in place in NSW since 2000. Police have the discretion to charge, or not to charge, those who are found using or in possession of cannabis. In the best of all possible worlds, this scheme could work well, ensuring that only those people with criminal intent would be arrested and charged. However, that assumes that police officers always work in the best interests of citizens, and a police officer would never abuse his or her power, as well as assuming the police were in agreement with an increasingly relaxed national attitude to the use of recreational marijuana.  Yet, according to one report, by late 2014, the number of NSW citizens arrested for possessing drugs had doubled during six years. Drug arrest data analysis suggested NSW was in the vanguard of a national trend of increased law enforcement directed at individual drug-users and a large proportion of the increase in arrests had been for cannabis. Mr Foley, for one, has endorsed the notion of striking the laws that criminalise the possession of marijuana from the statute books.  The NSW Bar Association late last year released a discussion paper on drug laws. The association suggested the so-called ""war on drugs"" had largely failed and there was increasing awareness throughout the world that new measures were needed. It recommended consideration of a harm-reduction approach, which might encompass the legalisation of now-illicit drugs and replacing the existing black market with some form of highlyregulated system. While legalisation might be a bridge too far, like every other suggestion, it is worth calm consideration. We welcome the continuation of a more mature discussion of drugs policy and we hope the debate on medicinal cannabis can be used as a window for a broader look at overall drugs policy in NSW.

This was published 4 years ago The Greens will become the first party with seats in Parliament to call for full cannabis legalisation in Australia, despite criticism from the country's top medical bodies. Greens leader Richard Di Natale said the ""war on drugs has failed"" and called for the establishment of an Australian Cannabis Agency that would be given a monopoly over the wholesale supply of the drug to shops, while collecting millions of dollars in a tobacco-style tax from consumers. ""Governments around the world are realising that prohibition of cannabis causes more harm than it prevents,"" the former GP who worked in drug and alcohol addiction said.

'War on drugs has failed': Greens leader Richard di Natale.Credit: Alex Ellinghausen Staff at the shops selling cannabis would be forced to undergo responsible service of drugs training and varieties of marijuana would come in plain packaging detailing strains and health warnings. The policy, which appears to be modelled on Uruguay's state-controlled cannabis program rather than the market-driven platforms of the US, would put Australia in line with nine US states, Canada and Spain in legalising marijuana for all adults. Colorado earned more than $260 million in tax revenue in 2016 after it sold more than $1.7 billion worth of marijuana, according to the Colorado Department of Revenue. A costing by the Parliamentary Budget Office for independent senator David Leyonhjelm found the budget would be boosted by $259 million over the 2015-16 forward estimates if Australia legalised cannabis, due to a reduction in law enforcement costs and an increase in GST takings. Neither the Coalition nor Labor have ever considered adopting such a proposal - while supporting medicinal cannabis - and the move is a significant escalation of the Greens drug policy, which previously focused on harm minimisation and getting treatments on Medicare. ""The use of any drug or substance has the potential to be of harm to the individual or to the community,"" its November 2017 policy stated as its number one principle. Influential medical bodies including the Australian Medical Association and Alcohol and Drug Foundation said they were concerned about the policy, which goes much further than the legalisation of marijuana for medicinal purposes. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians has also long lobbied against such a move. The vice president of the Australian Medical Association Tony Bartone said the AMA did not support the personal use of cannabis and had ""significant reservations"" about the proposal to allow people aged over 18 to use the drug. ""There is the importance of the developing brain, the Colorado model is 21-years-old,"" he said. ""We have considerable concerns about the risk for the young brain and the possibility of bringing on psychosis, especially in the younger age group."" But he said the AMA believed that criminal penalties should not be brought against users, echoing sections of the Greens policy. ""The courts are clogged with people [on drugs charges],"" he said. ""We see recreational use of cannabis as a health issue not a criminal issue."" More than 75,000 people are arrested each year for cannabis related offences, making up the largest proportion of illicit drug crimes according to the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission. Alcohol and Drug Foundation policy manager Geoff Munro said ""the risk was that it would lead to increased use and increased harm, particularly people who are most vulnerable to negative effects"". ""But there may be some positive effect,"" he said. ""It could reduce stigma around cannabis use and make it easier for people who are dependent to seek treatment."" Vice president of AMA Dr Tony Bartone. Credit: Darrian Traynor President of the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation Alex Wodak said banning cannabis hadn't stopped people using it, had distracted police and helped make some criminals rich. “Regulating cannabis will give government more control and increase government revenue, which can be used to fund drug prevention and treatment,"" Dr Wodak said.

This was published 1 year ago Researchers at the University of Sydney say drug driving laws are “out of date” and should reflect the results of a new study that found impairment after taking cannabis lasted about three to 10 hours. But the NSW government has dismissed those calls and defended its zero tolerance approach to drug driving, with tests that can pick up traces of the drug weeks after consumption. Drivers who use cannabis can be prosecution on the basis of the presence of THC in their blood or saliva .Credit: File image / Queensland Police Service Danielle McCartney, clinical research associate at Sydney University’s Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics, said a person could have the intoxicating component of cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), in their body and still be competent to drive. The research led by Dr McCartney, published in a forthcoming edition of the Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews journal, found cannabis users had a “window of impairment” of between three and 10 hours caused by THC. “Our study shows that cannabis is unlikely to impair driving for more than five hours when inhaled, or for more than eight hours when taken orally,” she said. Factors that influenced impairment included how regularly a person used cannabis, how it was consumed (inhalation, oral ingestion) and the amount they used. But Dr McCartney said there was no simple link between levels of THC and impairment, unlike alcohol where 0.05/0.08 BACs were widely accepted cut-offs. “High concentrations of THC in blood and oral fluid are possible without impairment, just as low concentrations are not always ‘safe’,” she said. “This makes it difficult to determine the point at which impairment typically subsides.” Dr McCartney said it was “becoming increasingly clear that our drug-driving laws are not only out of date but hugely unreasonable now that we have tens of thousands of Australians using legal, prescribed medical cannabis”. “Our drug-driving laws should be about enhancing road safety and minimising injury, not about criminalising drivers who have only the mere presence of a drug in their system,” she said. But Tara McCarthy, deputy secretary for safety, environment and regulation at Transport for NSW, said NSW did not support a levels-based approach to drug driving, which would require blood samples to be taken from alleged offenders. “Driving with illicit drugs in your system is not only illegal, it’s extremely dangerous and puts your life and the lives of all other road users at risk,” Ms McCarthy said. In contrast, there are moves in Victoria to overhaul drug driving laws to permit medicinal cannabis users to legally drive. Data from Transport for NSW shows 12,047 drivers were caught with drugs in their system through the Mobile Drug Testing program in 2020, including 6,812 people who tested positive for THC. Legal cannabis use, both medical and non-medical, is increasingly common across the world. Dr McCartney said medical cannabis patients in Australia experienced “great anxiety” over whether they could safely drive and use their prescription cannabis. Iain McGregor, academic director of the Lambert Initiative, said prosecution solely on the basis of the presence of THC in blood or saliva was “manifestly unjust”. THC can be detected in the body weeks after cannabis consumption while impairment lasts for a much shorter period of time, he said. “Our legal frameworks probably need to catch up with that and, as with alcohol, focus on the interval when users are more of a risk to themselves and others.” Amie Hayley, senior research fellow at the Centre for Human Psychopharmacology at Swinburne University, said there had been a move away from the zero-tolerance drug driving penalties in countries such as Canada and many US states that set an upper limit of five nanograms of THC per millilitre of blood. “This roughly equates to a blood alcohol content of 0.05 per cent, and provides a benchmark for how to estimate impairment,” she said. Dr Hayley said mandatory driving hazard warning labels might help users of medicinal cannabis decide whether they should drive, or they could be issued a conditional licence.

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 7 years ago Greens Minister Shane Rattenbury could move to introduce legislation creating a medical marijuana scheme for the ACT within a year, despite Labor and Liberal politicians moving to block the plans in a committee report. The report tabled in the Legislative Assembly on Thursday morning recommends the ACT government work with other state and territories on a national medical cannabis scheme and called on the federal government to improve access to synthetic cannabis drugs. An ACT Assembly report has recommended a national approach to medical marijuana.Credit: Max Mason-Hubers Draft legislation put forward by Mr Rattenbury would have allowed Canberrans with terminal and chronic illnesses to grow marijuana and use the drug to alleviate pain and symptoms. Under the proposal raised in July 2014, patients would have had to apply to the ACT Chief Health Officer for approval to possess and use cannabis. Approval could have been given to patients in three categories: those with a terminal illness with a prognosis of death within a year; serious illnesses or conditions such as cancer, AIDS or HIV, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or epilepsy; or those with chronic or debilitating conditions. The committee recommended the Assembly reject Mr Rattenbury's bill and called on the federal government to consider adding synthetic cannabinoids Sativex and Marinol to the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and for changes to laws around further clinical trials of cannabis. Mr Rattenbury accused the committee, led by Labor backbencher Chris Bourke, of failing to help Canberrans who needed the therapeutic benefits of medical cannabis. He called the report ""the worst case scenario"" for patients wanting to use cannabis for pain relief and to treat symptoms such as nausea and spasticity. ""The Liberal Party and the Labor Party have failed to take the courageous step that we need here, to assist people who need to be allowed to have access to medical cannabis,"" he said. ""Always this issue comes down to more delay, more obfuscation. The ACT should immediately move to create a simple register, like they've done in New South Wales, where people can register as using cannabis for medical purposes."" Mr Rattenbury said without progress on a cross-party bill in the Federal Parliament, he would be forced to introduce his own legislation by mid-2016. The move would force the ACT government to vote against the plan. The committee received more than 30 submissions from the public, experts and health organisations. Among concerns identified were barriers to medical research because of the legal status of cannabis, health risks from crude cannabis including from smoking and questions of supply of the drug. The report said supply chains from self-grown plants, cannabis clubs and collectives would not meet requirements of the 1961 international convention on drugs. It endorsed as a suitable framework a national medical cannabis scheme set to be considered by the Federal Parliament. The Senate's legal and constitutional affairs committee this week recommended the Greens bill to set up a regulator of medical cannabis be passed. The regulator would be ""responsible for formulating rules for licensing the production, manufacture, supply, use, experimental use and import and export of medicinal cannabis"". Under existing ACT law, it is illegal to administer cannabis to another person, possess any quantity of the drug, cultivate any quantity of it or sell or supply it to another person. Health Minister Simon Corbell said the government was yet to decide on its response to the committee report. Committee chairman and Labor backbencher Chris Bourke said the draft bill was ""naive and ill-considered."" He dismissed criticism from Mr Rattenbury that the major parties had again failed to act on the controversial drug and had abandoned sufferers. ""What we are saying is that the best solution is a federal solution. A Commonwealth solution that encompassess all of the states and territories, including the ACT, to deliver a scheme that should be managed by doctors,"" Dr Bourke said. He said any scheme needed appropriate controls on dosage, supply and drug quality. Copyright © 2023","Aug 13, 2015 ...

""However, we are waiting for those clinical trials in NSW to be undertaken and we'd also encourage the TGA to hasten the process."" One of the speakers at the Australasian Drug & Alcohol Strategy Conference in Brisbane addressed law enforcement officials on how cannabis could be legalised and managed. Beau Kilmer from the RAND Drug Policy Research Center said governments could benefit from legalising the drug by collecting tax revenue. He flagged several hypothetical models, such as a system where not-for-profit companies or private companies who valued ""people, the planet and profits"" were allowed to sell cannabis.  Mr Kilmer said people often thought of the ""extreme"" model of cannabis legalisation in California, where the drug is readily available for medicinal use. ""The first thing I would say is whatever change you make, it doesn't have to be permanent,"" he said. ""In the [United] States, cannabis users spend about $40 billion a year. One of the arguments if you were to legalise it, you could move some of that money away from criminals and that revenue could go to some of the government tax agencies."" On the topic of medicinal cannabis oil, Mr Kilmer said there were misconceptions and research showed health benefits were only in the early stages. A Cairns father is back in court next week after he allegedly used cannabis oil to treat his cancer-stricken toddler. The 30-year-old was charged with supplying dangerous drugs to a minor. The child is being treated for neuroblastoma cancer. His arrest in January outside Brisbane's Lady Cilento Children's Hospital, where his daughter was receiving chemotherapy, sparked outrage among medical cannabis advocates. The man was originally prohibited from making contact with his ill child, but his bail conditions were later altered to allow supervised visits.

The 32-year-old, who can't be named for legal reasons, walked away on Wednesday with nothing but a two-year good behaviour bond hanging over his head. Justice Peter Flanagan had taken into account the man's good intentions in feeding cannabis oil to his cancer-stricken daughter before she started chemotherapy. A medicinal cannabis advocate outside court told waiting media there were hundreds more like him throughout the country. The girl's father and his supporter leave court.Credit: Jorge Branco The man was in a desperate situation, faced with a fifty-fifty chance the cancer eating away at his daughter's stomach would claim her life. He was convinced the drug would cure or be of ""some beneficial assistance"" to his daughter and asked for chemotherapy to be delayed to give him a chance to try the oil, containing Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). He cooked cannabis oil in her food for at least three days before her mother found out, alerting doctors who told police. But Justice Flanagan, who weighed heavily on doctors' evidence the oil didn't do any harm (or any good), said it was no excuse for turning to an illegal and unproven drug as a remedy. ""What you did, no matter how much you believed in the beneficial effects of cannabis oil, was wrong and illegal,"" he said. ""It was illegal because cannabis oil still remains an illegal drug and a scheduled drug and you certainly were wrong doing it in the circumstances were it was done without reference to the doctors who were treating your daughter."" She was still battling to survive the disease, facing tests in the Lady Cilento Children's Hospital on Wednesday. Justice Flanagan stressed the importance of handing down a sentence that would act as a deterrent to anyone else considering the same action before deciding on a good behaviour bond. The father had already lost his job in IT at a Cairns Catholic school over the charges but the lack of a conviction boded well for his chances to regain his blue card in the future. There was some early evidence cannabis could work to relieve nausea associated with chemotherapy, moderate severe pain or stimulate appetite but nothing to suggest it could cure cancer, according to Cancer Council Queensland. Australian Medical Association vice president Stephen Parnis wouldn't comment on the individual case but similarly stressed more testing was needed before THC or cannabidiol, the two active ingredients in cannabis, could be safely used for medical treatment. ""Self treatment with any substance, let alone cannabis, is always fraught with risk,"" he said. ""I'm  a doctor, I don't treat myself. I have a family doctor, I seek his advice. ""And I say that because it is impossible to be objective about one's own medical issues."" After decades of limited scientific study in large part because of legislation blocking the way, the doors to testing have been thrown wide open in the past year.

""I like the truth, there's less to remember,"" Mr Smith, the founder of Phytotech Medical, said. ""It's like my cannabis conviction here in '89 in Australia, I just think it's so ironic.  ""There I was having police arrest me for cultivating and having cannabis and 25 years later I've founded a company determined to develop the medical benefits associated with it. ""Luckily I didn't have to do any jail time, I'm too pretty for jail."" Smith is a serial entrepreneur. He has founded companies including Jabiru Metals, Colonial Brewing Co and a broadband company, Request DSL. His latest project is Phytotech Medical, which will list on the ASX on December 22. It plans to work with farmers in Uruguay and the United States to set up marijuana crops, which it will cultivate and distribute in countries where medicinal use of the plant is legal. The marijuana will be sold as an ingredient for use in disposable vaporisers which the company will also sell to patients with conditions like cancer.  About 20 other countries have decriminalised marijuana use, including North Korea, where cannabis is completely legal, Iran, where regulated use is legal, and Uruguay, where it's legal for personal use. Smith said medical marijuana had the potential to become the 'Model T Ford' of the 21st century. Already it is estimated to be worth $US1 billion in California alone and about $100 billion worldwide. Patients use about 1 gram a day and pay $US14-$US20 for it. Medical marijuana has been legalised in more than 20 states in the US; in Washington state and Colorado, it can also be bought or grown for recreational use.  While growing or using marijuana is illegal in Australia, NSW and Victoria are holding clinical trials to analyse its use as a pain-reliever. South Australia, the ACT and Tasmania are also interested in joining the study. Smith said he has been speaking with American cannabis advocate Steve DeAngelo about using Phytotech's vaporiser and crops to supply his 140,000 patients in the United States. He said he was willing to be the face of the industry, as Clooney has been for Nespresso, the market leader in the coffee-capsule business. ""I'm just a handsome devil and George is a couple of years older than me, my hair's darker and I've got an incredibly good physique and what's more I'm still on the market,"" Smith said of comments he made comparing himself with the actor this week. ""I have this vision of me on Lake Como with two very attractive Italian models, blazing away on my vaporiser, and they say 'is that a Phytotech vaporiser you have there', and I say well yes it is."" While Phytotech will be listed in Australia and run its back office from Perth, Smith and the operations team, including business partner and managing director Boaz Wachtel, are all based in Tel Aviv, Israel. Smith said Wachtel was ""the father of the medical cannabis movement"", citing his early work with Israeli soldiers using medical cannabis to reduce the effects of post traumatic stress disorder and associated suicide. The pair are equal partners in the company and will focus on different parts of the business, Smith on distribution and strategy and Wachtel on operations and active management. The Phytotech float is being handled by stockbroker BBY. The offer is priced at 20 cents a share and the company hopes to raise $5 million. Smith said the offer, which closes on December 12, has been oversubscribed to the value of $15 million and would more than likely be closed early. Copyright © 2023","Dec 4, 2014 ...

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 6 years ago Queensland government moves to give cannabis the same status as heroin and cocaine as the most dangerous drugs will push marijuana users onto harder drugs, according to a visiting Canadian advocate. Dana Larsen, who operates cannabis dispensaries in Vancouver, will give a public talk on Sunday about Canada's new Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's plans to legalise and regulate cannabis use. Cannabis. Mr Larsen said Queensland's move to equate cannabis with heroin, ecstasy and cocaine would push marijana users onto harder drugs. ""I'm all for harm reduction,"" he said. ""I know a lot of people who use cannabis to stay off heroin, methadone and alcohol. Cannabis is a safer alternative."" The details of the new Canadian laws would be released later this year, he said. ""I'm hoping that it will include the right to grow a few plants for personal use,"" Mr Larsen said. Attorney-General Yvette D'Ath recently flagged plans to implement the recommendation of Queensland Organised Crime Commissioner Michael Byrne to simplify drug laws so that they were all considered as dangerous as each other. Mr Larsen, who has been agitating for legalisation all his adult life and uses cannabis for recreation and medical purposes, said the best way to protect children and keep society safe was to regulate its use, like alcohol and nicotine. Even Canadian courts had participated in civil disobedience by refusing, since the 1990s, to enforce the full penalties of the law for selling, using and possessing cannabis. ""I've seen a lot of changes in public opinion over the years,"" Mr Larsen said. ""If they taxed it and regulated it then the extra taxes could being going to schools, roads and health care. Instead, it's going to organised crime and it's not being regulated or taxed."" The public talk on Sunday, 'Cannabis in Canada', was organised by the Queensland Council of Civil Liberties, SEQ Hemp Embassy and Medicinal Cannabis Users of Australia. SEQ Hemp Embassy spokesman John Jiggens said police should target ice use which results in violence in society. Cannabis should be treated like alcohol or cigarettes, he said. Canadian activists, Dana Larsen and Ajia Mae Moon, will speak at Kurilpa Hall, West End, May 8, 2-5pm. For independent news coverage, be sure to follow our Facebook feed.

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 4 years ago A few years ago, a 68-year-old Bunbury woman (who wished to remain anonymous) would have been terrified at the thought of consuming cannabis. Now, she can’t imagine life without it. A 68-year-old Bunbury woman is calling for the Australian government to legalise cannabis.Credit: AP/ NOAH BERGER The woman, who was diagnosed with epilepsy 20 years ago, started using cannabis on a regular basis in 2014, after watching a documentary on television about the positive effects of cannabis in children with epilepsy. She had managed to keep seizures under control for most of her life, but after a four-year struggle with unsually severe seizures, depression and suicidal thoughts the documentary was the last push she needed to take the leap. ""For four years I didn’t live a life at all,"" she said. ""I lived in a black hole. At that time I would have tried anything."" Since embracing the plant-based drug, which she consumes between three and four times a month, the woman said she hadn't had any serious seizures, signs of depression or regrets. Instead, she is living ""a life of pure happiness"". ""[Cannabis] completely turned my life around,"" she said. ""I had to learn all over again what happiness was."" Now, five years after trying it for the first time, the woman wants to spread the word about its life-changing benefits. ""All I want is to help people that are seriously ill,"" she said. ""People are crying for help. ""I want to help the world appreciate what they are being denied access to."" The woman, who obtains her cannabis from the black market, said she would like legislation to change to allow Australians to own a cannabis plant for both recreational and medicinal use. ""It should go to a referendum like the [same-sex marriage vote],"" she said. Under current federal and state legislation, patients suffering from severe health conditions, including epilepsy, can legally access prescription-based medicinal cannabis. The drugs are not smoked, but rather come in oil and spray forms. Gaining access to the medication, however, can take up to several months. It requires patients to get a prescription issued by a Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and Western Australia Department of Health authorised doctor and, since the drugs are not included within the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) they can come with a significant pricetag. Dr Joe Kosterich, a medical advisor for Little Green Pharma, said doctors had filed 4200 applications for medicinal cannabis prescriptions by February this year. This represented a significant increase compared to September last year, when just 1500 applications had been lodged. Dr Kosterich said consuming cannabis purchased on the black market was unpredictable, illegal, and not necessarily cheaper than accessing the drug through legal channels. He admitted the process behind accessing medicinal cannabis through medical practitioners had room for improvement, but he said significant advances had been made to streamline the application process.
