https://www.racgp.org.au/advocacy/position-statements/view-all-position-statements/clinical-and-practice-management/medical-cannabis,Use of medicinal cannabis products,,"The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) highlights the need for further high-quality research into the safety and effectiveness of medicinal cannabis products, as the current evidence is limited and inconclusive. The current available evidence does, however, suggest a possible role for medicinal cannabis products in a number of areas. Therefore, if after conventional, evidence-based treatments have failed, and the specialist general practitioner (GP) feels that medicinal cannabis products are a viable treatment option for their patients, they should, as other specialists can, be able to prescribe appropriate medicinal cannabis products in accordance with the current regulatory framework. The February 2016 amendments1 to the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967 2 allowed the supply of medicinal cannabis products for the management of patients with certain medical conditions. The amendments allow the supply of pharmaceutical, nonsmokeable, medicinal-grade products. They do not include the provision of medicinal-grade herbal cannabis products and do not relate to the decriminalisation of cannabis for general cultivation or recreational use. However, only one such product is currently registered in Australia. Therefore, most pharmaceutical grade medicinal cannabis products that are available overseas are not registered medicines in Australia, and approval from federal and/or state and territory authorities is required through the Therapeutic Goods Administration’s (TGA’s) Special Access Scheme or Authorised Prescriber Scheme. The RACGP has further developed a position statement on The regulatory framework for medicinal use of cannabis products. GPs are faced with the pressing need to help patients who are unable to manage chronic and debilitating conditions using conventional, evidence-based treatments. Given the significant media and political coverage on medicinal cannabis products, GPs may experience greater patient demand to prescribe these products. However, as with all clinical decisions, GPs need to balance patient initiated demands for treatment and the clinician’s therapeutic responsibility, while considering federal and state or territory legislative requirements before considering the prescription of medicinal cannabis products. Refer to Appendix 1. Medicinal cannabis products checklist for more information. This position statement does not recommend nor encourage the use of medicinal cannabis products; however, it recognises that as specialists, GPs may offer to prescribe medicinal cannabis products to a very limited number of patients with specific conditions in consultation with them and their care team. Importantly, medicinal cannabis products should only be considered when all first-line, conventional, evidence-based treatment options have been exhausted, and after detailed discussions of the potential benefits and harms of medicinal cannabis products with the patient. The RACGP has always been a strong advocate for evidence-based medicine, and as the evidence around the efficacy and effectiveness of medicinal cannabis products evolve, this position statement will be reviewed to reflect the emerging evidence. Cannabis is a complex plant comprising more than 500 constituents, including approximately 100 cannabinoids.3 The main active ingredients used for medical purposes are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is the psychoactive part of cannabis that produces a ‘high’, and has been used to treat symptoms such as nausea, pain and muscle spasticity. CBD has no psychoactive properties, and has been used to treat several inflammatory disorders and epilepsy. Only pharmaceutical, non-smokeable, medicinal-grade products (listed in point one below) can now be supplied lawfully in Australia but medicinal cannabis products can come in three main forms: Currently, the only medicinal cannabis product registered for use in Australia is Nabiximols for the management of spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis; however, this is not listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). The cost of accessing medicinal cannabis products varies depending on the type and dose required, and the patient is responsible for all costs associated with this access. In several states and territories, patients may be eligible for medicinal cannabis products compassionate use schemes. At present, the evidence base for the use of medicinal cannabis products is limited. The current evidence base for the use of medicinal cannabis products is heterogeneous, comprising a small number of randomised clinical trials when stratified by condition, symptom or intervention type. These studies are of variable quality, including those with high risk of bias (eg incomplete outcome data), low statistical power, and short follow-up time. Recent reviews and analyses indicate there may be some therapeutic benefits of medicinal cannabis products in certain conditions;4,5,6 however, further research on the treatment efficacy and longer term side effects are warranted. Currently, most research and evidence on medicinal cannabis products have come from five clinical conditions – multiple sclerosis, palliative care, epilepsy, nausea and vomiting, and chronic non-cancer pain (refer to Table 1. Summary of evidence on medicinal cannabis products for more information). Numbers needed to treat and numbers needed to harm are included where possible. Around half the studies in a recent systematic reviews found that medicinal cannabis products may be effective for pain, spasticity, sleep and bladder function; the others were inconclusive.7 A number of studies have found low evidence for the use of medicinal cannabis products for the treatment of paediatric epilepsy, and for patients up to aged 25 years, especially when first-line treatments (ie anti-epileptic drugs) have been found to be ineffective.8 The numbers needed to treat are as follows: The numbers needed to harm for any adverse event was 3, and serious adverse event was 23. The use of medicinal cannabis products in palliative care is currently unclear.9  A small number of studies have found relief of nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy; however, the evidence is lacking and some were compared with now out-of-date practices. There is some evidence available for the treatment of neuropathic pain using medicinal cannabis products; however, the magnitude of effect is small.10 One systematic review found that the numbers needed to treat was 22 for a 30% reduction and 26 for a 50% reduction in self-reported pain intensity.5  Condition  Products  Quality of evidence12  Multiple sclerosis7 Pain Dronabinol , THC extracts Low to high and inconsistent Disability and progression None Spasticity Nabiximols and THC:CBD Low and inconsistent Bladder function None Ataxia and tremor None Sleep None Quality of life Nabiximols and THC:CBD Low and inconsistent Epilepsy8 Reduce by >50% and/or eliminate seizures CBD with anti-epileptic drugs Low to very low Oral cannabis extracts Very low CBD:THC Very low Cannabis sativa  Very low Quality of life CBD Low Oral cannabis extracts Very low CBD:THC Very low Cannabis sativa  Very low THC Very low Palliative care9 AIDS Dronabinol Unclear Cannabis sativa Unclear Alzheimer’s disease Dronabinol Unclear Cancer symptom control Dronabinol, THC:CBD, THC Unclear, maybe against Cannabis sativa  Unclear Nabilone Unclear Nausea and vomiting Dronabinol Low to moderate Nabilone Very low to moderate THC Low, insufficient evidence Levonantradol Low to moderate THC:CBD Insufficient evidence Cannabis sativa extract Unclear Nabiximols Insufficient evidence Chronic non-cancer pain10  Nabiximols Moderate to high Dronabinol Low to moderate Nabilone Very low Cannabis sativa Very low THC extract Moderate THC:CBD extract Low to moderate Ajulemic acid Very low CBD, cannabidiol; THC, tetrahydrocannabinol Adapted with permission from Therapeutic Goods Administration. Guidance for the use of medicinal cannabis in Australia: Patient information. Canberra: TGA, 2017. A 2015 systematic review did not find any studies that evaluated the long-term side effects of using medicinal cannabis products.5 However, medicinal cannabis products were found to increase the risk of short-term adverse effects such as disorientation, dizziness, euphoria, confusion, among others (refer to Table 2. Adverse effects of medicinal cannabis products for a full list). Side effects from medicinal cannabis products generally depend on the amount of THC in the product. Recommendations from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) also highlight that THC is not appropriate for:13 Medicinal cannabis products are generally believed to have low acute toxicity; however, its concurrent use with other drugs may mask adverse effects such as cardiovascular effects, and mortality may be under-recognised.15 Adverse effect  Odds ratio*  Disorientation 5.41 Dizziness 5.09 Euphoria 4.08 Confusion 4.03 Drowsiness 3.68 Dry mouth 3.50 Somnolence 2.83 Balance 2.62 Hallucination 2.19 Nausea 2.08 Paranoia 2.05 Asthenia 2.03 Fatigue 2.00 Anxiety 1.98 Vomiting 1.67 Diarrhoea 1.65 Depression 1.32 Psychosis 1.09 *The odds ratio is a measure of the increased (or decreased) chance of an event occurring compared to a placebo The RACGP recognises that while there are significant community and political interests in the medicinal use of cannabis products for therapy, the safety and effectiveness profiles of medicinal cannabis products are currently incomplete. The RACGP therefore highlights the need for further high-quality research into the safety and effectiveness on the use of medicinal cannabis products in Australia. There is also a need to ensure that education for the general public and medical practitioners is available. This education should reflect the current state of knowledge and contextualise the use of medical cannabis products as a last-resort medication for specific categories of illness that should only be prescribed in rare circumstances after stringent legislative criteria are satisfied.","Herbal cannabis on the illegal market: Potentially unstable THC and CBD, and may contain adulterants.

Patient name: 
 Patient address: 
 Patient date of birth: 
 As most medical cannabis products are not registered for use in Australia, special federal (ie Therapeutic Goods Administration [TGA]) and state/territory government s approval are needed to prescribe. This checklist aims to assist general practitioners ( GPs) in that approval process. 
Part A. Before prescribing medicinal cannabis products 
When considering whether medicinal cannabis products should be prescribed, it is important to have a detailed discussion of the potential benefits and harms of the treatment with the patient. All identified risk factors should be appropriately discussed, and ensure proper and accurate documentation. The following information should be documented in the patient’s clinical notes, and points should be considered and discussed with the patient  before prescribing medicinal cannabis products: • Family history – History of mental illness, especially schizophrenia • Past medical history – History of mental illness, especially schizophrenia – History of dependence of drugs of dependence – History of hypersensitivity to cannabinoid or products  • Current medical history – Cardiovascular, liver and renal diseases – Pregnancy and/or breastfeeding • Physical examination • Medication review – Potential side effects of medicinal cannabis products  – Potential drug–drug interaction with concurrent medication • Social support – Unable to drive while using medicinal cannabis products – Employment, especially in employment with machinery (eg forklifts, buggies) or high-risk occupations (eg at heights) – Risk of falls – Family responsibilities and support • Clinical justification for the use of the medicinal cannabis products  – Seriousness of condition and symptoms – All conventional, evidence-based treatment options that have failed – Length of time that the failed treatment options were trialled – Reasons for ceasing the treatment options that have failed – Safety and efficacy data to support the proposed use of the medicinal cannabis products  (eg clinical trials, peer-reviewed articles)  Page 7 of 12   Part B. Treatment plan for medicinal cannabis products 
TGA rules require a treatment plan to include a trial period (eg four weeks) to determine the effectiveness and efficacy of medicinal cannabis products for the patient, especially for symptom control. There is no precise dosing when a doctor chooses to prescribe medicinal cannabis products, as it is dependent on the patient’s characteristics. The following information should be documented in the patient’s clinical notes, and points should be considered and discussed with the patient in the creation of a treatment plan for patient s commencing medicinal cannabis products: • Treatment goals – Ideally be measurable at proposed intervals (eg reduction in vomiting in patients with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy) • Documentation of support from the patient’s other specialist(s) who is/are involved in their care (as required by jurisdictional legislation) • Dispensing – Note: It is important to obtain the cooperation of the community pharmacist before you consider prescribing medicinal cannabis products. When applying for approval, you are required to nominate an eligible pharmacist to dispense the medicinal cannabis products. Only medicinal cannabis products for a specific patient is able to be held in an approved community pharmacy. – Frequency of dispensing – Location of dispensing • Monitoring and review – Review of the treatment plan at proposed intervals  – Additional investigations • Ceasing treatment – Adverse effects are not tolerated – Medicinal cannabis products are not helping – Treatment goals are not reached • Informed consent – Refer to Parts C–F

Part D. Risks and side effects 
Unknown risks and late side effects 
Medicinal cannabis products are still in an experimental phase of testing. There may be side effects and risks that are currently unknown. In the event that the use of medicinal cannabis products is ongoing, you will need to inform the patient/guardian of these risks and keep updated with any significant information regarding previously unknown risks.  Possible side effects may include: • Asthenia (abnormal physical weakness or lack of energy)  • Confusion, disorientation, dizziness, drowsiness, vertigo, sleepiness • Balance problems, coordination • Memory problems • Diarrhoea • Dry mouth • Fatigue • Hallucinations • Vomiting or nausea  Page 9 of 12  Contraindications 
Medicinal cannabis products are generally not appropriate for the following patients : • Patients who have a history of hypersensitivity to any cannabis products • Patients who have severe and unstable cardiopulmonary disease  • Patients who have risk factors for cardiovascular disease • Patients who have a previous or current mental health condition  • Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding 
Relative contraindications 
Medicinal cannabis products should be carefully considered for the following patient:  
• Patients who are aged 25 years or younger • Severe liver disease • Severe renal disease • Misuse of drugs of dependence • Interaction with other medications • Paediatric and frail elderly patients with risk of falls 1. Potential risks associated with this specific patient, include family, and past and current medical histories:

https://www.racgp.org.au/advocacy/position-statements/view-all-position-statements/health-systems-and-environmental/the-regulatory-framework-medicinal-use-of-cannabis,The regulatory framework for medicinal use of cannabis products,,"The process of prescribing medicinal cannabis products in Australia remains highly bureaucratic, time consuming and expensive for patients, and differs significantly in every state and territory. A consistent national regulatory framework for prescribing medicinal cannabis products should be developed, which includes: The intent of the February 2016 amendments1 to the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967 2 was to allow the supply of medicinal cannabis products for the management of patients with certain medical conditions. Although further research is warranted and necessary in order to clarify the residual uncertainties of the relative efficacy and safety of various medical cannabis products, medicinal cannabis products can now be prescribed in Australia. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) updated its position statement in early 2019, which outlined the position on prescribing medicinal cannabis products in general practice, the challenges general practitioners (GPs) face, and the evidence base at that time. While the regulatory and prescribing regime must be robust to ensure only appropriate clinical access within the confines of the legislation, the prescribing process should be fit for purpose. The types of medicinal cannabis products that can be prescribed and the medical conditions that may warrant prescribing are not stipulated in legislation, and are generally considered on a case-by-case basis. Importantly, depending on their content, medicinal cannabis products are scheduled and managed differently under the Schedule of Medicines and Poisons (Poisons Standards) in each state and territory. Adding to the complexity, the legal requirements for prescribing medicinal cannabis products vary depending on how the individual product is scheduled in the jurisdiction. With the exception of Tasmania, all states and territories medicinal cannabis product prescribers can now submit a single application to satisfy both Commonwealth and state/territory-specific requirements to prescribe unapproved medicinal cannabis products. It is envisaged that when all necessary information has been received, a decision will be made within 48 hours that contains both Commonwealth and state/territory-specific approvals. The constant changes to, and complexities with, state and territory legislation around accessing medicinal cannabis products are significant barriers for GPs (Table 1).

GPs generally cannot access the Authorised Prescriber Scheme (APS).3 GPs who wish to obtain Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) endorsement as an Authorised Prescriber should first contact a clinical HREC (ie hospital HREC). If a GP is unable to access a hospital HREC, then it is recommended that they seek endorsement from an appropriate HREC. GPs making an application through the SAS must be able to demonstrate evidence of the benefits of the proposed treatment with a medicinal cannabis product, and that all other treatment options have failed. A treatment plan and ongoing monitoring plan must also accompany the application. SAS approvals are generally valid for 12 months, after which the application process must be repeated for treatment continuity.3 Any system of prescribing should recognise that GPs are specialists, and therefore should have the autonomy to determine when it is appropriate to prescribe medicinal cannabis products to eligible patients. As evident by the complexities of prescribing medicinal cannabis products noted above, the RACGP advocates for the simplification and streamlining of regulatory processes for eligible patients to access medicinal cannabis products. This has the potential to ensure patient safety and reduce variation because of different jurisdictional processes. In particular: As with any emerging treatment available on the market, especially those with limited evidence for efficacy and safety, GPs who consider prescribing these drugs need to be able to readily access evidenced-based information and educational material. Evidence-based clinical resources and education for prescribing medicinal cannabis products are essential for patient safety and uptake. While Australian and international guidelines are available,3 4 5 there is a need for the ongoing development of best practice guidelines. GPs should be provided with resources on the legislative and clinical aspects of prescribing medicinal cannabis products, as well as guidance on clear and proper governance processes on prescribing medicinal cannabis products. Patient education is also crucial. GPs are specialists, and those who wish to prescribe medicinal cannabis products should be treated like any other specialist, and have the autonomy to determine when it is appropriate to prescribe to eligible patients. An effective real-time prescribing system has the ability to save lives and protect the community by identifying patients who are at risk of misusing prescription medicine. The RACGP believes that as real-time prescribing systems continue to be rolled out across states and territories, they have the potential to be used to reduce and mitigate the risk of misuse or diversion of medicinal cannabis products. The RACGP encourages the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Health Council (CHC) to explore the implementation of the RACGP’s recommendations. A consistent national regulatory framework for prescribing medicinal cannabis products should be developed, which facilitates access when clinically appropriate, and reduces the bureaucratic, time consuming and expensive process doctors and patients currently face when trying to access medicinal cannabis products. It will help ensure that patient’s welfare is at the centre of this difficult and rapidly evolving area of medicine.","The current process of prescribing medicinal cannabis products in Australia is highly bureaucratic, time consuming and expensive.",9,1092

Further research is warranted and desirable to clarify the uncertainties of the relative efficacy and safety  of medical cannabis products. As is the case with all medications, cannabis products must be approved or registered through the  Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) before they can be prescribed.  
Cannabis and its medical use
General practitioners are faced with the pressing need to help patients manage chronic and debilitating  conditions, with chronic pain affecting approximately one in five people
1. Many patients do not respond well  to main-stream treatments for serious symptoms of illness. With recent changes to legislation around medical cannabis and media coverage creating a perception of easy access, general practitioners may experience greater patient demand to prescribe cannabis-based medications. Prescribing always presents challenges in balancing patient-centred care, evidence-based practice, and the legislative requirements, particularly where there is potential  for misuse of medicines
2. 
Sources of cannabis
Cannabis is a complex plant comprised of more than 400 constituents, including approximately 70 cannabinoids3.  The main active ingredients that are used for medical purposes are tetrahydrocannabinoid (THC) and cannabidol (CBD). THC is the psychoactive part of cannabis that produces a ‘high’, and it has been used to treat symptoms  such as nausea, pain and muscle spasticity. CBD has no psychoactive properties, and has been used to treat  several inflammatory disorders and epilepsy.  There are three main sources of cannabis used medicinally:• Pharmaceutical: medical grade products with standardised content • Medicinal-grade herbal cannabis: produced and processed in controlled standard conditions to a medical grade, free of adulterants, higher levels of CBD and other cannabinoids and lower levels of THC. This is provided to patients in herbal form, or processed as an oil, balm, capsule or pill. • Herbal cannabis on the illegal market (potentially unstable THC and CBD and may contain adulterants).Natural and synthetic cannabinoid products have been developed pharmaceutically and approved for medical  use overseas
4. There are three main products:• dronabinol, a synthetic form of tetrahydrocannabinoid (THC)• nabilone, a synthetic form of THC• nabiximols, a chemically pure 50:50 mixture of TCH and cannabidiol (CBD)In a number of countries, cannabinoid products such as those above are prescribed for nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, improving appetite for wasting illnesses, and improving muscle spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis
5-7. 
The legal framework
In February 2016, the Australian Federal Government passed legislation that amended the Narcotic Drugs Act, allowing the supply of suitable medicinal cannabis products for the management of painful and chronic conditions
8. This legislation does not relate to the decriminalisation of cannabis for general cultivation or recreational use and  it does not include the provision of medicinal grade herbal cannabis, only processed, non-smokeable medicinal  grade products
7. Medicinal use of cannabis products    
Position statement – October 2016
 2  RACGP Position Statement:  Medicinal use of cannabis productsMuch of the detail remains unclear. For example, the legislation does not specify which products will be covered  under the amendment, and it does not specify which particular conditions or symptoms will be eligible for treatment with cannabis-based products. Before products can be prescribed, they must be registered with the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) or, in rare circumstances, receive special approval from the TGA. The registration process requires evidence of testing and efficacy and it is therefore unlikely Australia will see a TGA registered medicinal cannabis product that GPs can prescribe any time soon. Whilst there are currently no cannabis-based products that are lawfully produced in Australia, the medicinal use  of pharmaceutical products containing cannabinoids is not prohibited, as long as authorisation for prescribing is granted from the Commonwealth Therapeutic Goods Administration and at this point in time, NSW Health
9. 
Criteria for prescribing
Some unregistered pharmaceutical cannabinoids can be obtained by particular patients through the Special Access Scheme (SAS). The SAS is a program which allows therapeutic goods that are not registered in Australia to be supplied with TGA approval under specific circumstances by a physician with a schedule 8 permit
7. Furthermore, as of August 1, 2016, the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Amendment Regulation will allow doctors in NSW to apply to the NSW Health Board to prescribe cannabis-based products that are not currently on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. Doctors will need approval from both the TGA and NSW Health before they can prescribe an unregistered cannabis-based product.A national regulatory framework for prescribing medicinal cannabis products is currently being developed.  Whilst  there will be state variation, as every state differs in its legislature on medicines, the intention is to produce  a cohesive, national framework that supports and compliments state legislation
9.
The evidence base for medicinal cannabis
The evidence base for the medical use of cannabis is currently incomplete. There remains much to be learned, particularly relating to treatment efficacy and the longer term side-effects of cannabis-based drugs. Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate that there is some therapeutic potential and that further research is warranted
10, 11 with a call for better designed clinical trials and longer duration of follow-up
3.  The emerging evidence suggests the use of cannabis medications for some patients with certain conditions that do not respond to mainstream treatments
3, 4. Cannabis-based medications are associated with a significantly increased risk of short-term adverse events (AE)
10, 11. The potential therapeutic effects of the full complement of all of the compounds in the cannabis plant have not  been tested and is an area identified for future research. In particular, the synergistic or entourage effects from  the full spectrum of constituents are thought to be important in treatment efficacy
7. Similarly, how the constituent compounds may interact with other medications is not understood
3. Whilst smoking of dried marijuana is the most common mode of use for medicinal purposes, its therapeutic  efficacy is limited, with exposure to harmful carcinogens and variation of dosage of both THC and CBD
5.  Smoking also predisposes patients to respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, which is problematic for  immune suppressed patients.
There is very little high quality evidence for the medical use of cannabis
The current evidence base for the medical use of cannabis is highly heterogeneous, comprising a relatively  small number of randomised clinical trials when stratified by condition, symptom, or intervention type. The studies  are also of variable quality i.e. high risk of bias such as incomplete outcome data, low statistical power, and short follow-up time
3, 10-12. Longer duration clinical trials are needed in order to establish long term efficacy, tolerance, dependency and  side effects of cannabis medications as well as the reliable dosing of delivery modes
13.  Moderate quality evidence from clinical trials supports the cautious use of cannabinoids for treating symptoms  of illness for a narrow range of conditions
1, 5, 7, 11.  A snapshot of the quality of evidence for treating conditions  with cannabis-based medications is provided in Table 1.  3  RACGP Position Statement:  Medicinal use of cannabis productsTable 1 Indications for treatment with medical cannabis products10, 11

# Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) is an approach to systematically compiling and assessing  evidence that includes assessment of study bias and side-effects. GRADE ratings of the evidence:  High – further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect;  Moderate – further research is likely to have an impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate;  Low – further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and it likely to change the estimate;  Very low – any estimate of effect is very uncertain.
Adverse events with cannabis-based medications
There is increased risk of short-term adverse events (AE) with cannabinoid use11. Table 2  summarises the findings of a pooled analysis examining AEs
11. Compared with placebo or alternative medication, the risk of any AE was approximately three-fold, with serious AEs being less common but still significant (Table 2). Common AEs include asthenia, balance problems, confusion, dizziness, disorientation, diarrhoea, drowsiness, dry mouth, fatigue, hallucinations, nausea, somnolence and vomiting. Studies reported serious AEs as infections, head injury, lung disease, however, it was not always clear if these were attributed to treatment or disease progression. Likewise, reported study withdrawals included a range of reasons including being unable to tolerate medication effects.

In response to the publicity and changing legislation relating to medical cannabis, there is a need for public and medical education. This education should reflect the current state of knowledge and contextualise the use of medical cannabis as a last-resort medication for specific categories of illness that can only be prescribed in rare circumstances after stringent legislative criteria are satisfied.Further information on the medical use of cannabis can be accessed from Cancer Council Australia website.

Position Statement – 2019 update   
  
 Position 
The process of prescribing medicinal cannabis products in Australia remains highly bureaucratic, time consuming and expensive for patients, and differs significantly in every state and territory. A consistent national regulatory framework for prescribing m edicinal cannabis products should be developed, which includes: • a user-friendly, single-step approval process that acts as a submission portal to all  relevant authorities (ie federal and state/territory regulators)  • efficient and timely processing of requests • legislative consistency between federal and state/territory governments  around access to medicinal cannabis products • education and training around evidence-based indications, regulatory requirements and prescribing processes of medicinal cannabis produc ts • a process where GPs should be treated like any other specialist, and have the autonomy to determine when it is appropriate to prescribe to eligible patients  • a consideration of introduction of approved medicinal cannabis products on real-time prescribing systems. 
Background 
The intent of the February 2016 amendments1 to the Narcotic Drugs Act 19672 was to allow the supply of medicinal cannabis products for the management of patients with certain medical conditions. Although further research is warranted and necessary in order to clarify the residual uncertainties of the relative efficacy and safety of  various medical cannabis products, medicinal cannabis products can now be prescribed in Australia.  The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners ( RACGP) updated its position statement
 in 
early 2019, which outlined the position on prescribing medicinal cannabis products in general practice, the challenges general practitioners (GPs) face, and the evidence base at that time. While the regulatory and prescribing regime must be robust to ensure only appropriate clinical access within the confines of the legislation, the prescribing process should be fit for purpose.  
 
Approval process 
The types of medicinal cannabis products that can be prescribed and the medical conditions that may warrant prescribing are not stipulated in legislation, and are generally considered on a case-by-case basis. Importantly, depending on their content, medicinal cannabis products are scheduled and managed differently under the Schedule of Medicines and Poisons (Poisons Standards) in each state and territory. Adding to the complexity, the legal requirements for prescribing medicinal cannabis products vary depending on how the individual product is scheduled in the jurisdiction.  2  RACGP Position statement: The regulatory framework for medicinal use of cannabis products     With the exception of Tasmania, all states and territories medicinal cannabis product prescribers can now submit a single application to satisfy both Commonwealth and state/territory -specific requirements to prescribe unapproved medicinal cannabis products . It is envisaged that when all necessary information has been received, a decision will be made within 48 hours that contains both Commonwealth and state/territory-specific approvals.  The constant changes to, and complexities with, state and territory legislation around accessing medicinal cannabis products are significant barriers for GPs (Table 1).   Table 1.

Prescribing medicinal cannabis products 
In general, GPs can only gain access to medicinal cannabis products through the Special Access Scheme (SAS), often with the support of a specialist treating the medical condition. GPs generally cannot access the Authorised Prescriber Scheme (APS).
3 GPs who wish to obtain Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) endorsement as an Authorised Prescriber should first contact a clinical HREC (ie hospital HREC). If a GP is unable to access a hospital HREC, then it is recommended that they seek endorsement from an appropriate HREC.  GPs making an application through the SAS must be able to demonstrate evidence of the benefits of the proposed treatment with a medicinal cannabis product , and that all other treatment options have failed. A treatment plan and ongoing monitoring plan must also accompany the application. SAS approvals are generally valid for 12 months, after which the application process must be repeated for treatment continuity.
3  Any system of prescribing should recognise that GPs are specialists, and therefore should have the autonomy to determine when it is appropriate to prescribe medicinal cannabis products to eligible patients. 
Recommendations: Approval process 
As evident by the complexities of prescribing medicinal cannabis products noted above, the RACGP advocates for the simplification and streamlining of regulatory processes for eligible patients to access  medicinal cannabis products. This has the potential to ensure patient safety and reduce variation because of different jurisdictional processes. In particular:  5  RACGP Position statement: The regulatory framework for medicinal use of cannabis products    • The administrative requirements of accessing medicinal cannabis products should not be unnecessarily duplicated. The introduction of a user -friendly, single-step approval process that acts as a submission portal to all relevant authorities (ie federal and state/territory regulators) would help to facilitate this goal. • Patients for whom accessing medicinal cannabis products is indicated often have chronic and debilitating conditions, and helping to ease these patients’ pain in a timely manner is essential. Processing requests for access to medicinal cannabis products on all levels of government therefore need to be timely and efficient. • There needs to be legislative consistency between federal and state/territory governments to remove the legal complexities around prescribing medicinal cannabis products, and so there is clear understanding of the GP’s legal obligations. Education 
As with any emerging treatment available on the market, especially those with limited evidence for efficacy and safety, GPs who consider prescribing these drugs need to be able to readily access evidenced-based information and educational material. Evidence-based clinical resources and education for prescribing medicinal cannabis products are essential for patient safety and uptake.  While Australian and international guidelines are available,
3,4,5 there is a need for the ongoing development of best practice guidelines. GPs should be provided with resources on the legislative and clinical aspects of prescribing medicinal cannabis products , as well as guidance on clear and proper governance processes on prescribing medicinal cannabis products.  Patient education is also crucial.  GPs are specialists, and those who wish to prescribe medicinal cannabis products should be treated like any other specialist, and have the autonomy to determine when it is appropriate to prescribe to eligible patients.  
Real-time prescribing 
An effective real-time prescribing system has the ability to save lives and protect the community by identifying patients who are at risk of misusing prescription medicine.  The RACGP believes that as real-time prescribing systems continue to be rolled out across states and territories, they have the potential to be used to reduce and mitigate the risk of misuse or diversion of medicinal cannabis products. 
Conclusion 
The RACGP encourages the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Health Council (CHC) to explore the implementation of the RACGP’s recommendations. A consistent national regulatory framework for prescribing medicinal cannabis products should be developed, which facilitates access when clinically appropriate, and reduces the bureaucratic, time consuming and expensive process doctors and patients currently face when trying to access medicinal cannabis products. It will help ensure that patient’s welfare is at the centre of this difficult and rapidly evolving area of medicine.

As GPs, it is important to understand the most recent clinical evidence and have access to appropriate support services for cannabis medicines. This webinar outlines the role of the NSW Cannabis Medicines Advisory Service and situations in which they may be able to assist prescribers; we will provide you with sources of appropriate information about cannabis medicines and discuss drug interactions and adverse effects, how you can monitor them, and reporting pathways. Dr Harry Nespolon Dr Catherine Lucas Ms Myfanwy Graham     
Sammi: Welcome to this evening’s Understanding Cannabis Medicines (part 3): Support Services for GPs webinar. My name is Samantha and I am your host for this evening. Before we get started, I would just like to make an Acknowledgement of Country. We recognise the traditional custodians of the land and sea on which we live and work and we pay our respects to Elders past and present. So moving along I would just like to introduce our presenters and our facilitator for this evening. So, we are joined by our facilitator, Dr Harry Nespolon this evening who I am sure all of you are familiar with. Harry is the current President of the RACGP and the Director of the Northern Sydney Local Health District and Principal of two general practices in Sydney. Harry is also a Fellow of the RACGP and has been a quality assurance examiner for the OSCE component of the Fellowship Exam for 10 years. Now to our presenters. Dr Catherine Lucas is a dual accredited Clinical Pharmacologist and Nuclear Physician and Pharmacist. She holds positions with both the University of Newcastle and Hunter New England Local Health District as a Staff Specialist, Clinical Academic and as a Medical Educator of a State-wide expert consultative clinical pharmacology service on the use of cannabis medicines. And our second presenter for this evening is Myfanwy Graham, who is a Senior Specialist Medicines Information Pharmacist based at the New South Wales Cannabis Medicines Advisory Service and instrumental in its inception and development. Additionally, Myfanwy holds an academic appointment at the University of Newcastle and has also had multiple peer reviewed publications. So thank you to our facilitator and presenters for joining us this evening. Alrighty, so I will hand over to our facilitator Harry now to take us through the learning outcomes for this evening, and we will then jump over to Catherine and Myfanwy to begin the presentation. Harry: Welcome everyone. I hope that you are all having a good night. The learning outcomes are, that by the end of the online event you should be able to identify the role of the New South Wales Cannabis Medicine Advisory Service and the context in which the Service may assist prescribers, list sources of appropriate information about cannabis medicines including product formulation, dosing regimens and potential interaction with other medicines, source scientific evidence and clinical guidance for a range of health conditions in patients and discuss the adverse events, monitoring and reporting pathways. I hope that you do enjoy tonight’s presentation and I will hand you over to our presenters for the night. Myfanwy: Good evening everyone, it is fantastic to see so many webinar participants joining us online. My name is Myfanwy and I am a Senior Pharmacist in the New South Wales Cannabis Medicines Advisory Service. I am also joined this evening by the Medical Director of the Service, Dr Catherine Lucas. By the end of the webinar this evening, we hope to have provided further information about the following topics: A quick review about access to cannabis medicines in New South Wales, an overview about the New South Wales Cannabis Medicines Advisory Service, cannabis medicines formulation, dosing and interactions, clinical guidance and support, approach to patient-centred care, measuring therapeutic effects, reporting adverse events, the Australian Centre for Cannabinoid Clinical and Research Excellence, and New South Wales clinical trials. In looking at this webinar, please refer to the two previous RACGP webinars, Understanding Cannabis Medicines part 1 and part 2, for background on evidence, access and prescribing. So, Sativex which is nabiximols is the only cannabis medicine on the Australian Register for Therapeutic Goods for the sole indication of moderate to severe specificity in multiple sclerosis. All other cannabis medicines are unregistered and are considered experimental. The unregistered cannabis medicines are compliant with the Therapeutic Goods order number 93 which specifies minimum quality requirements for cannabis medicines. There are no pre-determined conditions for which a cannabis medicine can be prescribed. Authorisation to prescribe a cannabis medicine occurs on a case by case basis. All applications to prescribe must be accompanied by clinical evidence. All registered conventional medicines and non-pharmacological therapies need to have been trialled or deemed inappropriate due to contraindications or lack of response. For example for pain, has the patient been referred to a multidisciplinary pain clinic? Important considerations for unregistered cannabis medicines include the following: Safety and efficacy data may not be available or it may not have been reviewed by an Australian regulator. Internationally the supply of cannabis medicines is increasing which may impact on ongoing supply. Other than Sativex which is nabiximols, which is registered for mild to moderate spasticity in MS, there is no product information or consumer medicines information which has been reviewed by an Australian regulator. The decision is solely the responsibility of the prescriber as per off label use of registered medicines. It is important to review available evidence and evaluate the risk versus the benefits persistent with the approach taken with off label prescribing of any drug. Documented informed consent would be imperative whereby the patient would be informed of the nature of the treatment and potential harms, and where the product is an unregistered medicine, that is has not been assessed for efficacy or safety by the TGA. The pathways for unregistered medicines include clinical trials and we have included a link to The Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry which has a search function to locate the clinical trials investigating the use of cannabis medicines. Some useful search terms other than cannabis include cannabinoids, tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, nabiximols, dronabinol and nabilone when searching the registry. The special access scheme which includes category A or category B and it is important to note that under category A, only imported cannabis medicines can be prescribed. And there is no true advantage to using category A for cannabis medicines. Authorised prescriber pathway involves ethics committee endorsement of a particular treatment plan. Authorised prescribers can prescribe a specific cannabis medicine for individual patients with a particular indication in their immediate care without further TGA approval. However, they do need to report the number of patients treated to the TGA on a six monthly basis. And the New South Wales Cannabis Medicines Advisory Service was established in January 2018 and is the first of its kind advisory service for cannabis medicine to my knowledge, in the world. The service is available to New South Wales practitioners only and is not nation-wide. The service offers free clinical support and advice for medical practitioners considering prescribing a cannabis medicine. So we provide information about cannabis medicines, their formulations, dosing, potential drug interaction, and advice tailored to patients’ specific clinical context, current scientific evidence to support applications, guidance tools for monitoring, potential therapeutic and adverse effects and information on open clinical trials using cannabis medicines. We have included some statistics from our service, so over 590 enquiries have been received to date and the top three enquiry groups include GPs, around 30%, other specialists at 24%, pharmacists at 20% and the top three most common enquiries were medical practitioners with a patient in mind requesting patient-specific clinical guidance and evidence reviews. We also addressed enquiries about the approvals process and application support and many enquiries related to product selection including what doses are available and administration routes. The average response time is 24-48 hours for end of life and 3-5 business days for non-palliative enquiries, providing all required information has been provided. And many enquiries are clinically complex patient specific enquiries with multiple comorbidities and medications. So it is important to clearly delineate the difference between cannabis medicines which are also known as medicinal cannabis and street or black market cannabis. Cannabis medicines are standardised medical grade cannabis plant derived, semi-synthetic or synthetically produced cannabinoid products developed for medicinal use. Cannabis medicines conform with the therapeutic goods order number 93 standard for medicinal cannabis also known as TGO 93, which specifies minimum quality requirements for cannabis medicines. Street cannabis is also known as black market cannabis. It is accessed from unregulated sources and is illicit. The composition of the street cannabis product is unknown and it may contain harmful substances. So historically there have been reports of bacterial contamination. There have been several reports of opportunistic infection with fungi in immune-compromised patients with the finding that cannabis was contaminated by fungus spores. Pesticide use for cultivation of cannabis crops is well-established and human consumption of pesticides may confer substantial sequelae including malignancy, developmental issues, reproductive, neurological and endocrine disorders. And there are three pathways by which street cannabis may be contaminated with heavy metal substances including soils, during processing and post-processing adulteration whereby metals may be added to the preparation to increase weight and thereby appreciate its street value. So moving on to cannabis medicine formulation, there are a variety of cannabis medicine dosage forms and there are a number of considerations in selecting a dosage form. Many cannabis medicines are in oil form, and other dosage forms include capsules and tinctures. It is important to consider the content of the carrier oil and potential allergy or previous hypersensitivity, for example some of the cannabis medicines are in a sesame oil and if a person has sesame allergies. And tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol are both highly lipophilic and have poor oral viability, estimated to be as low as 6%. Oral THC formulations exhibit variable absorption and undergo extensive hepatic versus past metabolism resulting in lower peak plasma THC concentration relative to inhalation. And a longer delay to reach peak concentration. Following oral administration CBD a similar plasma concentration time profile to the oral THC has been observed. And based on this profile, oral formulations may be useful for patients requiring symptomatic relief over a longer period. Oral mucosa preparations undergo rapid absorption via the oral mucosa and hence is useful for symptoms requiring rapid relieve. So producing plasma drug concentrations higher relative to oral, but reduced relative to inhaled THC. However part of the dose may be swallowed and orally absorbed. Flos or granulate refers to the whole dried female flower, which is administered by vaporisation and there are no devices on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods and there are potential restrictions on where the product can consumed as well. So, cannabinoids administered by inhalation exhibit similar pharmacokinetics to those administered intravenously. After inhalation, peak plasma concentration for first THC and CBD are attained rapidly within 3-10 minutes and maximum concentrations are higher relative to oral ingestion. The pharmacokinetics are vaporised and smoked cannabinoids are comparable. Transdermal administration of cannabinoids avoids the first pass metabolism, but their extremely hydrophobic nature limits diffusion across the aqueous layer of the skin. Studies with human studies skin have determined the permeability of CBD to be ten-fold higher than of delta-9 THC and delta-8 THC, less potent but more stable relative to delta-9 THC and consistent with CBD as being relatively lipophilic. I should note that throughout the slides this evening when we refer to tetrahydrocannabinol, we are referring to delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol. We will move on to TGO 93 compliant formulations. So we frequently get asked about what cannabis medicines are available and there are a variety of cannabis medicines available with different strengths, pharmacokinetics and dosing regimens. This slide outlines the strength of various formulations which are available, however please note there are a variety of products available with different strengths, including cannabidiol predominant products including liquid formulations with strengths ranging from 1.2 mg per ml to 150 mg per ml. CBD capsules containing 50 mg per capsule, and CBD topical balm 5%. There are also combined Tetra Hydra Cannabinol and Cannabidiol 1:1 liquid formulations with strengths ranging from 8.33 mg per ml of both THC and CBD up to 25 mg per ml of both THC and CBD. There are also combined THC and CBD capsules as well. When referring to THC throughout this presentation, it is important to note that it is in relation to Delta 9 Tetra Hydra Cannabinol. THC predominant liquid formulations range in strength from 10 mg per ml to 25 mg per ml. There are also granulate flos products, which are THC predominant ranging from 13.5% to 22% and a combined THC and CBD product and also CBD predominant products as well. So moving on to general principles of dosing, the dose and frequency of administration is individualised for the patient and indications. And the following general principles should apply in relation to dosing. The starting load in terms of dose and frequency and go slow, titrating according to effect whilst monitoring for side effects and due to dose titration in an initial trial period of three months. First titration of an initial trial period of three months is suggested to determine patient response. The following table on the next slide, is derived from the Sativex product information. And this is a dose titration guidance and practitioners may titrate more slowly depending on patient response. The patient is commenced on one spray in the evening and on day three this is increased to two sprays in the evening. On day five, this is increased to one spray in the morning and two sprays at night and is incrementally increased as per the dosage guidance table up to a maximum of 12 sprays per day until they achieve optimum symptom relief. So continuing with dosing, New South Wales CMAS also performs literature reviews to determine whether there is indication-specific dose guidance data. So for many indications there is limited evidence but there is data about dosing. The following dosage guidance is derived from the TGA guidance for the use of medicinal cannabis for the prevention and management of nausea and vomiting in Australia. For example, for dronabinol, this would equate to 2.5 mg up to 20 mg between one and four times a day. And we will discuss now the costs of cannabis medicines. So although cannabis medicines are not covered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, they are comparable in cost to street cannabis. So for palliative indications, the approximate cost is $21 to $70 per week for cannabis medicines which equates to around $3 to $10 a day and a recent Australian survey has indicated that there is a mean spending of $68.60 per week on street cannabis which equates to around $9.80 a day. Another important consideration is that THC is generally not appropriate for known or suspected personal or family history of a significant psychiatric illness, as current evidence supports the association between THC and an increased risk of psychosis and schizophrenia. Also unstable cardiovascular disease due to sympathomimetic effects including tachycardia and has been associated with myocardial infarction and stroke. In addition, pregnancy due to reports of pre-term labour and low birth weight, and cannabinoids can also pass into breast milk. Other considerations include significant renal herpetic illness due to increased bioavailability of THC and the prolongation of half-life, potential for dependence of withdrawals, age less than 25 years, specifically with THC due to the potential neurocognitive effects. Epilepsy and seizures as THC may be pro-convulsive. Conversely research is ongoing in relation to the use of CBD for the treatment of epilepsy. In older patients, pharmacokinetic parameters may be altered such as renal and hepatic impairment and relative increase in body fat. Consequently this can result in an increased bioavailability of THC and prolongation of half-life. Hypersensitivity to cannabinoids or excipients such as sesame carrier oil needs to be considered and an important consideration is also driving and operating heavy machinery which is an absolute contraindication. And there is a prescribed cannabis medicine and a prescribed fitness to drive fact sheet available. So we will move on now to drug interactions, for drug-drug interactions, which may be pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic in nature. Pharmacokinetic interactions result in a change, so either an increase or a decrease in blood levels of either one or both drugs, whilst pharmacodynamic interactions relate to the observed effect. Pharmacodynamic interactions may be interactions between co-administered drugs which produce the same effect and this effect is augmented. For example the enhanced sedative effect seen when benzodiazepines are administered with alcohol. Co-administration of medicines may also augment the adverse effects of drugs with similar side effects. Some added effects may be desirable such as antiemetic effects or analgesic effects. So let us look at a couple of examples with cannabis. So we see additive effects when co-administered with other medications. There is clear evidence that THC can enhance sedatives, psychomotor, respiratory and other effects as seen with depressants and alcohol. And when co-administered with anti-cholinergic agents, cocaine or sympathomimetic drugs, cannabinoids which are known to produce tachycardia, have been shown to enhance the tachycardic and hypertensive effects of cannabinoids. There has been at least one case reported of a patient experiencing symptoms of hypermania when marijuana was co-administered with fluoxetine and there has been at least one case reported of a possible interaction in a patient taking warfarin who regularly smoked tobacco and marijuana. There has also been a recent case reported of an interaction between warfarin and cannabidiol so therefore INR should be monitored when cannabinoids are initiated. And looking at some of the pharmacokinetic reactions. A major source of drug interaction is via induction or inhibition of CYP enzymes. The enzymes involved in the metabolism of THC are thought to be CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, whilst those thought to be involved in metabolising CBD are CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. So CYP2D6 might possibly also be involved in the metabolism of these two compounds. So let us look at drug interactions affecting THC and CBD. So co-administered drugs which inhibit or induce enzymes involved in the metabolism of THC and CBD may lead to either an increased blood concentrations in the case of inhibition, or decreased blood concentrations in the case of induction. Co-administration of ketoconazole which is a CYP3A4 inhibitor with THC was observed to increase the plasma THC concentration by 20%. The other commonly used drugs are also 3A4 inhibitors and theoretically these agents such as clarithromycin, itraconazole, might also produce a similar effect to ketoconazole. Rifampicin is an enzyme inducer, particularly 3A4 and this drug, when co-administered with THC was observed to reduce THC concentrations by 40%. When co-administered with CBD, CBD concentrations were decreased by 20% and there are other commonly used drugs and compounds such as St John’s Wort, phenytoin, carbamazepine which are inducers which may theoretically have a similar effect. And on the previous slide, it was noted that CYP2C9 is involved in the metabolism of THC. Genetic variability in enzymes may also influence the THC concentrations achieved after administration of THC. THC concentrations were observed to be three times higher in poor metabolisers than in people with what is classed as normal metabolism. However, there are no specific studies that have looked at co-administration of cannabis with CYP2C9 inducers or inhibitors. But we can anticipate that there may be an effect. While CYP2C19 has been shown in vitro work to be involved in metabolism of CBD, a study with omeprazole, a CYP2C19 was co-administered with CBD did not show increased CBD levels in the blood. So in terms of the effect of cannabinoids, THC and CBD on the metabolism of other drugs, in vitro work has suggested that THC may inhibit CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, while CBD is shown to be an inhibitor to various extents for a range of CYP enzymes, including the ones listed on this slide. From an induction perspective, in vitro work suggests minimal induction of CYP by THC and CBD and overall the clinical relevance of recreational or medicinal use of THC and CBD concomitantly with other medications remains poorly described or unknown. So hence the need for caution. It is also important to note that cannabis medicines are not administered by smoking. However, there are drug interactions related to cannabis smoking. The potential exists for drug interactions to occur when patients smoke cannabis, so smoking tobacco and smoking marijuana induce CYP1A2 enzyme and induction of CYP1A2 has been observed to lead to reduced clozapine and olanzapine levels in smokers compared to non-smokers. An important point to consider is what happens when a smoker who is on a drug which is a CYP1A2 substrate ceases smoking and the enzyme is no longer induced. There may be an increase in plasma drug levels which may result in adverse effects. Therefore patients who smoke cannabis and are being treated with a CYP1A2 substrate drug such as an anti-psychotic agent, should be regularly monitored with regards to their smoking consumption so it may be adjusted if required. So drugs used for immunosuppression in transplant patients may also potentially be affected by co-administered cannabis. The dose/trough ratio is observed to be decreased in patients exposed to marijuana, suggesting inhibition of CNI metabolism with a magnitude of effect being greater cyclosporin A than tacrolimus. And there has also been a case reported of suspected tacrolimus toxicity in a stem cell transplant patient who was concurrently using oral marijuana. Proposed mechanisms of interaction include inhibition of CYP3A enzymes and possibly an interaction by the efflux pump P-glycoproteins which play a major role in the absorption of tacrolimus. Of importance is the observation of drug interaction between CBD and clobazam and another anticonvulsant drug, topiramate. With increasing dose of CBD, serum concentrations of topiramate increased whilst concentrations of the active metaboliser desmethylclobazam increased. This increase in active metabolite concentrations may be due to inhibition of CYP2C19 which is primarily responsible for the metabolism of N-desmethylclobazam. This prolongs the elimination half-life of the metabolite resulting in accumulation of the metabolite in the body. There are TGA guidance documents which are available from the TGA website and include topics such as multiple sclerosis, palliative care, epilepsy and paediatric and young patients, nausea and vomiting and chronic non-cancer pain. And the New South Wales Cannabis Medicines Advisory Service provides clinical guidance and support on use of cannabis medicines to treat a range of health conditions and symptoms. Catherine: I would like to take this opportunity now to discuss the importance of patient-centred care, particularly in the general practice context. The patient’s current treating medical practitioner with whom there is already an established therapeutic relationship is the most appropriate person to prescribe and subsequently monitor the outcomes of cannabis medicine if applicable, in a shared care model following consultation and ideally in consensus with their other treating medical practitioners and patient care team. All members of the patient’s care team should be aware of the trial of therapy with a cannabis medicine. The reason that we deem the current treating medical practitioner to the most appropriate prescriber is that they have a comprehensive understanding of the patient’s medical history including their relevant family history particularly with regard to psychiatric adverse effects and their patient’s lifestyle and encompassing a holistic care model for the patient, and to communicate adequately within the multidisciplinary team based model of care to ensure that all practitioners are aware of the therapy. And, CMAS is here as the first point of contact for general practitioners considering prescribing a cannabis medicine and we strongly encourage medical practitioners to work in partnership with us and their patients regarding their cannabis medicines. And just a reminder that we are a free Government funded service here to help both you and your patients by providing you with the relevant information that you need to support your application with evidence. Myfanwy: And it is also important to consider the patient’s social circumstances, not just the patient. So we are considering looking at obligations to patients. So patients using cannabis should be warned not to drive or to perform hazardous tasks such as operating heavy machinery, because impairment of mental and physical coordination resulting from the use of cannabis or cannabinoids may decrease their ability to perform such tasks. Another important note is that some cannabis medicines require refrigerated storage and there are differences related to cannabis medicine possession in different countries and it would be important for the patient to contact the Embassy of the country they are considering travelling to prior to travelling. We will now look at measuring therapeutic effects. So another important consideration is measuring of potential therapeutic effects and adverse effects. It is important to negotiate pre-defined measures of success with patients prior to commencement of therapy in relation to their symptoms. Adverse effects may occur at different dose levels in different patients and careful monitoring needs to be implemented for adverse effects including but not limited to abdominal pain, dizziness, euphoria, nausea, paranoid reaction, drowsiness, abnormal thinking, vomiting, asthenia, balance problems, confusion and so on. In addition to adverse effects, consider non-responsiveness, patient reported improvements may not be matched by functional gains which is a really important consideration. And consider quantity cognitive testing. So cognition potentially may be sacrificed to alleviate other symptoms and it is important to monitor. We have included a couple of examples of how therapeutic effects may be measured. One in pain and one in palliative care. So firstly, treatment goals need to be clearly documented and discussed with the patient. Secondly, they need to be related to the symptoms for which the patient is prescribed cannabis medicine and if possible, they should also be measurable. So for example in pain, this may include the use of pain scales and in palliative care, symptom assessment scale. In relation to adverse effects, it is important to note that adverse effects may become apparent after commencement or after change in dose. Adverse effects may be related to other concurrent medications and doses of these medicines should be adjusted as appropriate. Adverse effects, even those anticipated, must be reported to the TGA, including dependence and withdrawal symptoms. And if clinical review determines that the patient is not deriving benefit or is experiencing toxicity, the cannabis medicine treatment should be discontinued. For TGO92 compliant cannabis medicine, it is important to report even anticipated adverse effects. The notifier or prescriber needs to report to the TGA within 15 calendar days and also to the supplier and importer. The prescriber has an obligation to notify the TGA as a condition of their special access scheme approval and for life threatening adverse effects, the notifier or prescriber needs to call an ambulance to transfer the patient to an emergency department. For serious but not life threatening adverse effects, the notifier or prescriber needs to contact the New South Wales Poisons Information Centre team for clinical toxicology guidance. Adverse effect reporting pathways for street cannabis are dependent on how the product is labelled. So, for example if it is labelled and sold as a medicine, it needs to be reported to the New South Wales Chief Pharmacist Unit. If it is labelled as synthetic, it needs to be reported to New South Wales Poisons Information Centre and if it is labelled or sold as food, it needs to be reported to the New South Wales Food Authority. We would also like to take the opportunity to discuss the Australian Centre for Cannabinoid Clinical and Research Excellence, also known as ACCRE, which is based at the Hunter Medical Research Institute in Newcastle. And ACCRE is involved in the development of the prescribing protocols for cannabis medicines, so both in palliative care and non-palliative care indications. They are involved in the establishment of the New South Wales Cannabinoid Blood Analysis program, involved in standardised data collection about safety and efficacy of cannabis medicines, and are currently developing the New South Wales CARE trial for palliative care patients to be launched in 2019. With New South Wales clinical trials, the New South Wales Government has committed nine million dollars towards three clinical trials to: evaluate the safety and effectiveness of cannabis medicine, reduce seizures in children with severe treatment-resistant epilepsy in partnership with the Sydney Children’s Hospital Network, improve appetite and appetite related symptoms in adult palliative care patients with advanced cancer, prevent chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting in adult patients where standard treatments have proven ineffective, and as referenced earlier, the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry is a really good resource for locating clinical trials related to cannabis medicine. A few notes about our service. So the New South Wales Cannabis Medicines Advisory Service as Catherine mentioned is the first point of contact for doctors considering prescribing a cannabis medicine for their patients. The service is available 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday and we have included our phone number and email contact details here. Catherine: So we will take the opportunity to refresh the learning outcomes of this evening, which include identifying the role of the New South Wales Cannabis Medicines Advisory Service, and also the context in which we may be able to assist prescribers, to list the sources of appropriate information about cannabis medicines including the product formulation, dosing regimens and health conditions in patients which we are able to assist you with, and to discuss adverse events, monitoring and reporting pathways which we have touched on previously. Sammi: Thanks for going over that, Catherine. We just lost our audio there for a second. Harry had a question that he wanted to jump in and ask you guys about, okay? Harry: So I just wondered if we could go back. If we were giving advice to patients who were driving, as I understand it if they ask us if they are tested, they will still come up positive. I was just wondering if you could talk about that a little bit more? Catherine: Our primary concern in the context of driving is paramount to the testing that the actual patient’s cognitive impairment and subsequent risk to themselves and other road users and pedestrians, so regardless of whether the testing is involving the cannabinoids that they are potentially being prescribed, both tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, there is a misconception that the latter in terms of having less cognitive adverse effects is safe to drive with, and that is certainly not the case. There are reports of drowsiness and impairment also with CBD, so it is emphatically an absolute contraindication, not just because of the positive testing which can be positive for a very protracted period of time, particularly when patients redistribute from their adipose stores. And because that timeframe is unpredictable and very patient-specific depending on things like body habitus, consumption pattern, there is no safe timeframe to give the patient, so absolute contraindication. Patients must be advised not to drive and you can support that advice with the written fact sheet that is available free online specifically pertaining to it that has been developed by the Ministry of Health. Harry: And just to underline that, writing a letter will not prevent them from running into problems. Catherine: Absolutely. There is certainly no exemptions. So the equivalent of any other medication, say if someone is on a high dose opioid, regardless of whether it is legally prescribed, they are not going to be covered with a medical letter. That does not negate the impairment and the risks. That also applies to the clinical trial context. We have had the misconception from some people that the patient is prescribed within a clinical trial context that there is an exemption for driving, but that is, yes, not the case in any circumstances. Harry: The next issue which I just thought we might also emphasise is that the application process requires approval from both the State and the Commonwealth? Is that…? Catherine: Sorry Harry, I understand the question was does the application to prescribe a cannabis medicine require State and Commonwealth approval? Is that correct? Harry: Correct. Catherine: Correct. So, for the process of applying for cannabis medicines has been streamlined, whereby there is a single submission to the Therapeutic Goods Administration, so the Commonwealth level, and that is for both schedule 4 and schedule 8 cannabis medicines. If the cannabis medicine in a schedule 8 cannabis medicine, then the TGA forwards the application to New South Wales Health where they also look at the application as well. So it really is a single streamlined pathway. Harry: And also, that when you are filling in these applications with your assistance, it still requires the patient to have come to the end of their therapeutic regime before the cannabinoids will be approved, is that correct? Catherine: That is most definitely correct. So cannabis medicines are not a first line therapy. All registered standard therapeutic options must have been exhausted prior to the consideration of the use of a cannabis medicine, or they may have been deemed inappropriate due to adverse effects as well. Harry: And one of the questions was about, and I am not sure if there is any work on this, but whether or not cannabinoids are good in early labour? Catherine: If you revisit the slide that we had on precautions and contraindications, there was reference to particularly THC preparations but also cannabis medicines would not be appropriate for use in pregnant patients, so the answer in that respect would be no. Harry: So you do not think it will give them enough pain relief. Catherine: Well there would be risks to the patient. There would be risks in terms of potential adverse effects for the mother and the child and they cross the placenta, so there are a number of different important considerations in relation to pregnant patients, yes. Harry: With that, I do not think we have got any other questions, and I think while we were off air here I gather you guys did go through the learning outcomes. I might just leave it open for a few more seconds to see if there are any other burning questions from the audience, because if not we might call it a night. Sammi: Yes, let’s give it another two minutes and we will give our participants the opportunity to type some questions through now that we have a bit of time and see what comes through. Harry: I guess one of the other questions might be, do we know how many, I think there is at least one Australian producer that is licensed that is producing cannabinoids. Is that increased recently at all? Catherine: We are happy to advise individual practitioners on the most appropriate product, whether that be one that is available on shore or that has been sourced internationally, or locally. But the primary consideration is first whether the cannabis medicine is appropriate for the patient and then the particular ratio of THC and CBD, the cannabinoids for that patient’s indication and then at that point we would be discussing with the practitioner the most appropriate product or products and would be able to advise them as to whether they are locally or internationally produced and what is available on shore and the relevant dosing guidance for their indications. Harry: Thank you. Sammi: So that brings us to the end of this evening’s presentation. We thank you all for joining us and I just want to say a big thank you to our facilitator Harry and to our two presenters, Catherine and Myfanwy for a fantastic job. And that brings us to the end of the session, so thank you for joining us everybody and good night.",This webinar outlines the role of the NSW Cannabis Medicines Advisory Service and situations in which they may be able to assist prescribers.,12,5977
https://www.racgp.org.au/education/professional-development/online-learning/webinars/medicinal-cannabis/understanding-cannabis-medicines,Understanding Cannabis medicines: Prescribing in General Practice - part 2,,"30 May 2018 The cannabis medicines landscape is one that is ever-evolving. As general practitioners, it is important to understand the most recent clinical evidence for cannabis medicines use, and the legislative and legal framework around their prescription. Understanding Cannabis Medicines (Part Two): Prescribing in General Practice focuses on how cannabis medicines can be prescribed, including where to find reliable information when making prescribing decisions, the important role of GPs when cannabis medicines are prescribed, and the importance of informed consent and monitoring patients on cannabis medicines. Dr Harry Nespolon Dr Jan Fizzell     
Sammi: Good evening everybody and welcome to this evenings twilight online Understanding Cannabis Medicines (Part Two) Prescribing in General Practice webinar. My name is Samantha and I am your host for this evening. Before we make a start, I would just like to make a quick Acknowledgement of Country. We recognise the traditional custodians of the land and sea on which we live and work and we pay our respects to elders past and present. So, to introduce our presenters for this evening, we are joined by Dr Jan Fizzell. Jan is a public health physician, working as a medical advisor in the Office of the Chief Health Officer at the New South Wales Ministry of Health. She has been working on facilitating the New South Wales clinical trials program for medicinal cannabis and cannabis-derived products and assisting in cannabis therapeutics policy development in New South Wales. Jan also has a keen interest in health technology assessment and population based screening programs. And our second presenter and facilitator for this evening, is Dr Harry Nespolon. Harry is the current Chair of Sydney North PHN and Principal of two general practices in Sydney. Harry is also a Fellow of the RACGP and has been a Quality Assurance Examiner for the OSCE component of the Fellowship Exam for the last 10 years. So thank you for joining us and welcome, Harry and Jan. Harry: Thank you. With that great introduction, I am just going to hand over immediately to Jan to present Cannabis Medicines – Prescribing in General Practice. Jan: So good evening, everyone and thanks for joining us. So we have some learning outcomes for this evening’s session, and we are hoping that at the end of the activity, you will have some better ideas about the pathways, requirements and processes to lawfully prescribe and supply cannabis medicines in New South Wales, that you will have a better idea of where some of the reliable information is and what kind of cannabis medicines to prescribe. You will also be able to discuss the ethical and legal responsibilities, plus the liabilities that apply to prescribers when using unregistered medicines, and that includes thinking about informed consent processes and precautions when using unregistered medicines, and explain the different roles of GPs and specialists in cannabis prescription and the requirements for ongoing patient monitoring. So, we will do a very quick review of the session that we had a couple of weeks ago just looking at the cannabis medicines. And then we will have a look at the regulation prescribing pathways, have a look at some of the medicines that are available, then thinking about what to consider when prescribing a cannabis medicine, working as a prescribing and monitoring team. I will briefly go into the informed consent processes that are expected by TGA as part of prescribing unregistered therapeutic goods, and also talk about driving and heavy machinery, or just the workplace THC testing that some patients are encountering. We will also talk about monitoring outcomes of the treatment and think about some of the reliable sources of information. So, cannabis as a therapeutic has been used for thousands of years. It was used widely in the 19th Century for many different things, including palliative care of patients with rabies. It was regulated worldwide from the late 19th Century, such that wide spread medical use had really ceased in the 20th Century. Research in Israel in the late 20th Century helped us identify an endogenous cannabinoid system and showed that this cannabinoid system has an influence on disparate body systems including neurological. It modulates immune function and gastrointestinal effects. The other thing to consider is, that previously when we were using pure plant derived products, that cannabinoids that people ingested or inhaled were particularly THC, but as commercial investigation goes for other cannabinoid uses, we are starting to see larger doses of these other cannabinoids being used in therapeutic terms and to some extent they are not things that people have been exposed to through recreational use. So, we have got two main compounds of that available to prescribe in Australia at the moment. Many of the cannabis medicines in Australia are plant derived products, so they also have a spattering of other cannabinoids and terpenes and other things that can have some biochemical and pharmacological function. We have got Delta-9 THC which is the most studied phytocannabinoid. It is responsible for the psychoactive effects of cannabis. It can help reduce nausea and vomiting and in fact a synthetic THC, dronabinol is registered in the US and Canada for that indication. In animal models of pain, it is a reducer of pain. It may improve appetite. People are famous for the munchies, but unfortunately in clinical trials in cancer patients it has not worked so well, so we are looking again at how that might be working in our clinical trials. It has got anticonvulsant and proconvulsant dose-dependent qualities and the oral doses are usually starting quite low and a recommended maximum is about 30 mg a day. Cannabidiol is the other, next most studied phytocannabinoid. It is not intoxicating. It can be sedative. It is really good at interacting with the cytochrome P450 system and so it is important to consider other drugs that patients are on when prescribing cannabidiol. We are seeing quite large doses being used in paediatric epilepsy. We do not have good evidence around cannabidiol alone having a clinical effect in low doses and that is mostly because the clinical trials have not been done. In models, it is antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, it may be neuroprotective and it may modify some of the psychoactive effects of THC, but it is important to understand that just because you give somebody cannabidiol alongside their THC, does not mean that they are free of the chances of having an unfortunate adverse event. So, things that your patients might be asking you about or considering include the ongoing cost. So, to say that there is a standard cost is not correct. It is quite variable depending on the condition and dose required, because the charge is usually for the amount of cannabinoid used daily rather than because of all the drug development costs and so on. So, a patient who is on 5 mg a day will have a very different cost to somebody who is on 2 grams a day, and that is just how the pricing model is at the moment. And that is why you see these widely varying costs quoted to patients. Most unregistered medicines, if they are supplied out of our hospitals have been evaluated by a drugs and therapeutics committee, and they will usually often be funded at the same time. At the moment, for most cannabis medicines, there is not the evidence of efficacy such that they could be considered cost effective, and so the medicines are normally not being provided by hospital and LHDs, which is why GPs are starting to see patients seeking use of unregistered medicines in general practice. Because I do not think it is particularly common, is it Harry, for unregistered medicines to be being used. Harry: That is correct. Often you will be approached by a patient rather than the other way around. Jan: Yes. Pharmacies need to be identified to order in the medicine. They generally do not hold stocks of the medicines, so that is usually about a two to three day delay in the medicine actually getting from you having an approval to actually someone shipping the medicine into the pharmacy where it can be dispensed. The other thing is, that unlike other medicines where you can give a patient the consumer information, there is no reliable consumer information for the unregistered therapeutic goods. A lot of the cannabinoid companies have brought stuff in from Canada that has not been reviewed by a regulator. There is no quality control on it like you see with consumer medicine information in Australia, so you just have to be slightly cautious about what information people are getting and what information you are giving to people. Harry: Is it easy for the pharmacies to get the product if it is here in Australia? Jan: It is, so it is relatively easy I understand for a pharmacy to get the product in. A lot of the goods are held at standard wholesalers around Australia and the challenge can be if there is a cold chain requirement of shipping the good and different cannabinoid products have different stability testing about how well they go outside of being kept cold. So that can be a bit challenging. There is also the fact that we have been given in New South Wales Health, the advice from an expert group that you really should not be driving with THC on board. There is no defence under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act for being caught with THC in your oral fluid just because it was prescribed, because the levels at which we see clinical effects of THC are also the levels at which we see impairment from THC. We also know that some workplaces do on the spot drug testing and then that is up to the doctor and the patient and perhaps the place of employment to negotiate well how much does that particular drug impair that patient? Is it safe for them to operate heavy machinery? Or is it safe for them to be making important decisions even, if they may have some impairment. And that is a similar assessment that you would be doing with any other medicine that can cause significant drowsiness or impairment of cognitive function. One just needs to be really careful about talking it through with your patients, about you know, you may have a limit on what you can actually do at work and we should not just confine that to forklift trucks. If you have got to make important financial decisions, it is important that you are clear thinking as well. So, a lot discussion is about the regulation of cannabis medicines and they are in a really unusual place because we have got a demand for unregistered medicines and they are also regulated by both national processes by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and then by State processes, where we are interested in safe use of controlled substances, so S8 drugs. So, nationally there is the National Scheduling Committee, a group of experts that provide advice about which schedule a particular pharmaceutical might sit in, and so we have S4 prescription only medicines and cannabidiol only medicines that have only a trace of THC if you are into the S4. S8 medicines which are the controlled drugs, and then S9 are prohibited drugs, and anything with cannabis that is not actually coming in under TGO 93 is likely to be prohibited still. We then have the decision by the TGA to list or not on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, we then have, assuming the sponsor makes an application, for the medicine to be listed or not on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Looking at the cost effectiveness of those particular medications for a particular condition. The TGA has developed a standard for medicinal cannabis which talks about making sure that we have got a certain amount of cannabinoid in each product, that it is free of heavy metals and that it is free of contaminants. And that is what TGO 93 looks at. We have national decisions about import and export, but most products that people would use are on-shore. And then we have the use of unapproved medicines which is a TGA decision. In New South Wales, we need to adhere to a number of different parts of legislation. So we have the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act which is mostly around looking at how we package labels, store, write prescriptions, make sure that we keep records of supply, particularly of controlled substances. We also have the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act, and a person who is lawfully prescribed a prohibited drug is not committing an offence. So if a person has been lawfully prescribed a cannabis medicine if the doctor has received an authority from the New South Wales Ministry of Health to prescribe an S8 drug, then that person is not committing an offence. We also have in New South Wales the Care and Protection of Young Persons Act, and this is about protecting vulnerable people from doctors doing things to them that they perhaps should not do. And so, within that we should not carry out special medical treatment on a child, so that is defined in this Act as a person under 16 years otherwise in accordance with this section, and that means we should not be prescribing a psychoactive drug to a child for more than 10 days in any 30 days. We also have the Guardianship Act and that has a protection for vulnerable people who are unable to consent regarding special medical treatment, so again using psychoactive drugs that are not endorsed by a professional group or standard. And so for patients with dementia who are actually unable to consent, you are probably best off going and talking to the Guardianship Board, because a relative cannot consent for you to do special medical treatment on a vulnerable person. So, if there is any concern that the person may not be competent to consent to the treatment, I would really encourage people to get guidance. So, doctors applying for authority for prescribing in New South Wales, so this is completely different to the PBS authority system, there is too many words with “authority” in them at the moment and it all gets very confusing. I am sorry, I have come in on the end of lots of people naming things all the same thing, so I can only apologise for my forebears. But an authority to prescribe in New South Wales is about prescribing certain controlled substances, and that includes Schedule 8 opiates for a drug dependent person. It includes the prescription of certain benzodiazepines. It includes prescription of an unregistered or extemporaneously compounded Schedule 8 product. So, for example we have had previously people are trying to compound ketamine injections. Those people would now have to get an authority to be able to prescribe those compounded ketamine injections. Schedule 8 cannabis medicines including nabiximols and there are certain other restricted products, mostly to do with reproduction hormones and things that can be easily diverted. So who is looking at what in brief? So if you have a look at the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth is looking at the product, is it a product that complies with TGO 93, or is it a registered medicine overseas. The Commonwealth looks at the patient, including the seriousness of the patient’s condition, and they also look at the health practitioner applicant’s qualifications, expertise and also how long they have had a therapeutic relationship with that patient. Within the State, we still look at issues of diversion, so if there has been a history of practice such that it is likely that a patient could have diverted opiates from the same practice for example, or a patient has a history of drug dependency that the doctor may not have been aware of. There are issues of appropriate use of an unregistered controlled drug, so generally speaking we leaving the clinical assessment to the TGA, but if we start seeing for example THC being prescribed for hangnails, we might have something to say about that. And also, we do check to see if say for example, an application went through to the Commonwealth to prescribe a THC product for a 15-year-old, we would then have to say to that doctor, did you realise that we have now got to go and talk to the Department of Family and Community Services about this? And that is not, and that is just to get permission to prescribe that. So, we have medicines that are on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods which includes nabiximols which is Sativex which is marketed in Australia. You do not have to apply to the TGA to prescribe nabiximols to patients. You do need to notify New South Wales Health and get an authority to prescribe. And it is available in Australia, it is registered, it has got a huge amount of safety data behind it, and so you are on fairly solid ground as far as being able to look up product information, having appropriate consumer medicine information. So you are on fairly safe ground with nabiximols as far as looking at the evidence, because a lot of the clinical trial evidence is generated using Nabiximols. But also you have got evidence against use, you know, where a clinical trial is not showing a benefit. Harry: One of the questions is, is there much inter-batch variability in the quality of the product? Jan: So, with each batch, the supplier has to provide a certificate of analysis with the batch. There can be some batch to batch variability. I was really surprised to find out that standard pharmaceuticals can have plus or minus 10% of what is on the label, and for cannabis medicines it can be up to plus or minus 20% because they are plant-derived products. So it is about making sure that you are aware of the quality. You could even ask, so can you show me more than one batch certificate and you might get an idea of who is providing stable batches versus who has got widely varied cannabinoid content. So, it is, they have within plus or minus 20% of what they have got on the label. Harry: Does that have much of a clinical effect that you know of? Jan: I think at the moment, we are not at precision dosing levels with many of these things because the absorption of these medicines is so variable from person to person. I am not a pharmacologist but my understanding is you know, different people will process them differently. So, I think individual person to person variation is almost as important as batch to batch variation. But having said that, if we are looking at something, someone like a small child with epilepsy, where cannabidiol can increase the levels of their other anti-epileptic drugs from a therapeutic range to a toxic range, we have got to be particularly careful about trying to get as much as a standardised product as possible. You know, particularly if we are dealing with small children who require you know, large doses of cannabinoid and are not going to tolerate variations as much potentially. We have also got medicines registered with the overseas regulators, dronabinol which we are seeing some applications for being used here, and Marinol is the usual trade name for that. There is nabilone which is a THC analogue that is also registered in the US and Canada. And there is a cannabidiol product called Epidiolex which we are currently using in our compassion access scheme for kids and it is heading for RDA approval. It has recently passed one of the big hurdles and so we are expecting to hear something in June about it potentially being registered in the US. So, there are registered medicines available, though sometimes more expensive than the plant medicines. But you do get, you know for something like dronabinol which is a synthetic, there is no batch to batch variability beyond any other standard pharmaceutical. So just to speak a bit more about nabiximols and the reason why I am talking about it, is it is actually registered. So you have got lots of information there. You have got drug-drug interactions. You have got lots of things available to you. It is actually registered for use in refractory spasticity and multiple sclerosis here. It went to PBAC for a decision and it was not considered to have significant enough clinical efficacy to then go on and assess the cost effectiveness, so at the moment it is not available on the PBS. It has been used in lots of clinical trials as I mentioned before, some of which are quite small, so I think the rheumatoid arthritis trial had less than 50 people on it, but it still had some effect. And I have provided the link to the New South Wales notification required and that authority gets transmitted back to you so that you can send off the information to the wholesaler and you can get it in for your patient. So, then we go onto our unregistered medicines that are available, and this is that Therapeutic Goods Order 93. They are currently all imported from overseas, however some of the production companies are saying they will have local products soon. They are manufactured under good manufacturing practises of pharmaceuticals. There are different levels of GMP. One is for food standards which is where you see a lot of the products coming out of Europe are compliant with the food standard which is nowhere near as rigorous as the pharmaceutical standard. So they do have a known cannabinoid content. They are free of heavy metals. Any information a supplier may give you has not been assessed or approved by a regulator. You will not get any information generally about the product-specific absorption dose side effects. Some of them have actually been used in clinical trials overseas where an ethics committee has had to review and investigate a brochure, so that might give some comfort that there is some of that data available. They have not been assessed by TGA for safety or efficacy and a lot of their use is extrapolated from registered medicines or studies in other countries. So when we think about the unregistered medicines, their safety and efficacy data is often not available, or if it is available, it has not been reviewed by a regulator. They are often in carrier oils and it is important to understand each one, so if you have got somebody who is intolerant of sesame or coconut or lots of different oils that they are in, you need to understand which oil they are in, so you need to ask the question. Some people would like to vape the products. There are no actual devices registered with TGA to vape medicines. There are some devices registered overseas. One thing to keep in mind though with vaping, is that we do have a Clean Air Act, and it is very difficult to tell whether you are vaping medicinal cannabis or doing something else, and so there are some limits. And then there are the hard limits of the fact that you know, something that is potentially flammable and oxygen just do not mix. So you know, there are all of those considerations as well. There is no need for these products to have an ongoing supply guarantee. They are available and as long as they are in stock they are in stock, but there is no guarantee that they are going to be re-supplied from overseas and there is no published product information for your consumers. So if you wanted to know all about the different medicines that are available, there are over 50 I think I counted today that are currently available. This is where you can go and see the full list of products. They are usually manufactured in Canada. They have been imported. They are on-shore and they are dispatched from the importer to the nominated pharmacist. So, when we talk about prescribing unregistered medicines, it is usually done through three major routes. One is the clinical trials route and TGA has two particular schemes, the clinical trial notification where an ethics committee signed off that the product is appropriate to use in a clinical trial, and the other is the clinical trial exemption where the TGA actually does the assessment of the products. Most clinical trials using cannabinoids are using the clinical trial notifications scheme, so an ethics committee has reviewed it. The Special Access Scheme where there is category A, you still need State approval for an S8 and category B which is your standard pathway where TGA does it. I would really encourage people to use category B. There is no true advantage to using category A for cannabis medicines with our single notification pathway. Authorised prescriber is yet another pathway which involves having an ethics committee endorse a particular plan of treatment. So the Special Access Schemes legislation to ensure medicines, Australians can access medicines prior to registration or for example, if a drug company choses to withdraw a registered medicine here and a patient was using it, they can have a supply imported from elsewhere in the world where the medicine is still available. It is administered by the TGA. For us it is a single form to the TGA and TGA sends to New South Wales State Authority. And you can see TGA has put this illustration around you know, trying to balance how much evidence you have to provide to use a particular medicine versus the clinical need of a particular patient. And so my poor hangnail patients will probably need very high evidence before TGA approved use of an unregistered good to treat hangnail. The Special Access Scheme, so the TGA advises that if you are considering using the Special Access Scheme to prescribe, you need to understand that it has not been evaluated for quality, safety or efficacy and it is not an approval by TGA. They are looking to see is it within the realms of safety and not so inappropriate that it is unimaginable. They are not looking to say, yes this is good. They are not endorsing your practice. They cannot guarantee the quality, safety or efficacy of an unapproved product. They have tried to put some safety there by saying here is the cannabinoid content. It is free of this and it is free of that, but they cannot say somebody is not going to have a paradoxical reaction or even an expected reaction to the medicine. And the thing is, you do not have to prescribe an unapproved medicine if you do not think it is right to do so. It is really important not to feel pressured into doing that. So, the TGA is quite explicit about the obligations of informed consent. The product, so your patient needs to know it has not been approved by a medicines regulator. They have to understand the benefits of treatment, now you know the risks and adverse effects, the possibility that there could be things that we have not known about, or late adverse effects, and the patient should also be aware of other treatments that are available to them. TGA advises that consent should be recorded and written if possible. The patient should probably think about the cost of treatment before you send off their data to the TGA, so you need to have a good conversation with the patient before you start talking to organisations like TGA and New South Wales Health. We do not need to know about your patients if once they are told about the cost they are not going to want it. So have that good conversation with your patient before you submit their data. Some companies are promoting their website as a great pathway to easy prescribing. I would really suggest that you think about your patient’s privacy and make sure that they consent if you are going to use any of those private prescribing services, because if their data gets leaked from one of those services, you need to be sure that it is going to be secure. And just a reminder around do not drive if it is a THC containing product. We need to make sure that we have got appropriate clinical tools to monitor the health of your patient and that usually would involve having a treatment plan, so that if an agreed outcome is not being met the doctor could consider discontinuing the treatment. You have actually got an objective measure that has been negotiated between you and your patient. And sometimes that is really important because we have seen that often cannabis medicines, because they are what is being tried after everything else has failed, there is a great temptation to keep going even if the treatment outcomes are not being met. But this is coming at a physical risk to the patient, a financial risk to the patient, and so it is really important that we have got some good way of having that conversation right up front that if we have not met these treatment goals and have them agreed on. Now, that is not to say that you might not reassess the treatment goals because whilst you know, the pain was not a lot better I was sleeping a lot better though doctor, I feel better because of that. You might consider in that clinical consultation that that is a worthwhile treatment outcome and on the basis of that, you are ready to go. But to capture that treatment outcome you have got to think about it as you start or as you are titrating the dose of cannabinoid. It is important to remember that you need to report serious adverse events to the TGA and to whoever supplied you with the medicine. And the TGA is going to look for your objective evidence of how you have been monitoring the patient and how they are going along and making sure that things are being monitored and you know, that may also include patients being willing to keep a pain diary or a seizure diary, or you know, there are lots of clinical tools for monitoring how people are feeling and it is about using ones that you are familiar with and you are happy to educate your patients on. So, the Authorised Prescribers Scheme. We will just touch on that. So this actually involves you developing a clinical protocol that talks about how a particular drug will be used in a particular population of patients who have particular condition. It has a defined dose regime where you escalate according to a particular dose. It has got defined monitoring and defined starting and stopping rules. It is usually endorsed by NHMRC-endorsed or a College ethics committee. My understanding from looking at the RACGP website, is currently the RACGP’s ethics committee is not looking at authorised prescribers at the moment for anything, not just cannabis. It is just not a thing they have capacity for at the moment. And authorised prescribers still need to notify New South Wales Health for each patient to get an authority for each patient, because again there is that potential where a person has a particular history of drug dependency that a prescriber may not be aware of, so we still need to make sure that we minimise the risk of diversion for the community. Harry: Just going back to the nabiximols, when, because it is an S8, they need an authority from the beginning. It is not just the dependent patients. You will need that combination TGA, New South Wales Health. Jan: No, no TGA, just us. It is just New South Wales Health to do the authority for nabiximols, and it is a registered medicine and we are turning those around in a matter of hours. Harry: But it is from the very first one. Jan: From the very first go. And that is simply because we are still monitoring the uptake in the community. It is an S8 controlled drug. We are hoping that like overseas we will see that there is, you know, a fairly small risk of diversion, fairly small risks and then we can talk about rescheduling things. But at the moment it is an S8 drug and so we have got the fairly tight controls at the moment. Harry: And just before you move on, is there any protocol regarding ongoing management of the patient in terms of regular blood testing or those sorts of issues? Jan: So, it very much depends on what you are prescribing for a patient and why you are prescribing it. So, for example for a child with epilepsy who is having high dose cannabidiol, they are having their liver function regularly monitored. They are having therapeutic drug levels regularly monitored. If you had a patient for example, who was having a combination product with cannabidiol who was on warfarin you would want to watch their INR very closely. They do not seem to be causing a lot of renal impairment and as I say, the cannabidiol we are not sure whether it is only in the very high dose patients who tend to have their liver function go off. And so it is more about monitoring the clinical condition and seeing how your patient is going and if you have got any concerns, just checking in. But I will talk about a service that is available to help doctors later in our presentation. So at this point, having given you all the bad news, we are getting to some of the better news. So, this is when it is a reasonable time to talk about prescribing cannabis medicines with your patients. So, you have looked at the therapies with better evidence. You have used them or they are contraindicated for this particular patient. A good example is we have patients who do not tolerate megestrol acetate for simulation of appetite in palliative care patients. So, they have sort of done step one, and they could not tolerate the steroids because they stayed up all night awake and not tolerating it. They could not tolerate the megestrol or it was contraindicated because of the type of cancer they had, and so to stimulate appetite we would really like to try some THC containing products. And so, that is reasonable. They do not have to have had a new episode of steroid psychosis to qualify if that is it, it is a past history of intolerance is all people are looking for. We are not looking for people to get tortured in the line of getting approved. It is helpful if there is high quality evidence of efficacy or for example, where we are looking at something like spasticity in multiple sclerosis, spasticity in spinal cord injury, spasticity with a similar pathophysiology. You can reasonable extrapolate it is likely to be effective for your patient. You might have a significant number of case reports with good pre-clinical evidence of likelihood of efficacy for some patients, because you know, for some people with rare diseases we will never get a large cohort. But the really important thing is that both the patient and doctor are aware of the uncertainties and willing to proceed. So, one of the key questions is, who is best suited to lead prescribing of the cannabinoid, and that comes down to a really important consideration of how confident are you as practitioner in managing this patient with this particular disease. Some patients are incredibly complex. They have got rare diseases. They have got refractory disease and normally I think most people would say well that is in the realm of a specialist or even a subspecialist for some patients. You need to be very sure that you are very familiar with all the prescribed and other therapies for that particular patient. So we know with the kids with epilepsy for example, you know if their liver function tests are going off, do you cut back on their sodium valproate or do you cut back on their cannabidiol. But that is something that the paediatric neurologist understands, but because they have worked a lot and become authorised prescribers for cannabidiol for these kids with epilepsy, so they are aware of all the pre-clinical work, they are aware of the current clinical work. So, it is that question, if something is starting to go off once they start prescribing a cannabis medicine how comfortable am I that it is either a different drug or the cannabis medicine that I am prescribing. How familiar are you with other options for therapies? So, you know, I would suggest that most general practitioners are fairly comfortable working around palliative care to some degree with chronic pain. But even so, it is around for a chronic pain patient signing them up to a psychoactive long term drug is not a small decision. Similarly to you know, prescribing opiates long term now that we have got the evidence that it is not a particularly helpful thing to do, is a big decision. And so, working through all the other ways of looking after that person first before you explore cannabis medicine. Thinking about how much evidence can you hang your hat on that this is a good thing to do, probably Wikipedia is not the best place to go hunting for evidence. The ability to manage side effects of the medicines, so you know as I said the drug-drug. And again, even though dependence is not a particularly high problem with cannabis medicines, if there is already evidence of dependence and considering polypharmacy. So considering about how confident you are managing those issues and having those conversations with at the end of 12 weeks. You are not convinced as the objective practitioner that it is making that much difference. Are you really happy to have that conversation that it is time to stop? So, I did mention earlier that there are commercial operations that are here to help, but we are really quite concerned about how some of them are promoting themselves in New South Wales. I would point out that across Australia, less than 500 approvals have happened, so no one has got a huge body of practise at this point and the products as I say are expanding greatly, so I do not think anyone is across every single product that is currently available on the market. Also, how confident you are in referring someone to a different general practitioner for example, because a lot of these services are staffed by general practitioners, to manage significant health conditions, as compared to you as a general practitioner who is aware of this patient, who has been working with this patient seeking advice and support which we will supply from New South Wales. We have funded a cannabis medicines advisory service. We will talk a bit more about it later. So, if the problem is that you actually do not think this is a good idea, we would really promote you actually saying to your patient, this is not a good idea and saying why and being open about your concerns because sometimes what we are being told is that it is too hard, there is too much paper work. Underlying all that is actually I do not want to do it because I do not think it is a good idea. And if say it is too hard, you will not be surprised when you get a call from one of these prescribing services saying your patient has come to us, will you help us support their application? You are kind of jammed then, if that is what has happened. But also, we have got a publically funded service there to help you and we will do pretty much what the commercial operations are offering to do if you are willing to put that time into that patient, and we are there to help. And also, it is really important that everyone is on the same page when we are prescribing, because if you have got one doctor who is trying really hard to reduce the polypharmacy in a patient and you have got another doctor saying here is a new drug, it is not good for the patient, it is not good for anyone. So, I will just put up the slide that we used last time just to talk about some of the things that you, that physicians in Canada have suggested that they are comfortable about. In Australia, generally for neuropathic pain they would like to know that somebody has actually seen a pain clinic and has engaged with a pain medicine program. For palliative pain though, people recognise the expertise of general practitioners in managing palliative care patients. For chemo induced nausea and vomiting, again I suggest some caution to make sure that the patient’s treating oncologist is also on board with it. If they are on board, that is no problem, but considering there are lots of different reasons why a chemotherapy patient might be vomiting, it might not just be because they have had a lot of emetogenic chemotherapy and they are saying well I am vomiting because of the chemotherapy it might be something else going on, so it is really important that everyone is on the same page with that. And again spasticity and multiple sclerosis when a neurologist has been looking after the person and you have sort of got to that point and you and the neurologist are happy to work together, that is a recognised indication, no problems. So, thinking about contraindications. So, I have taken this from the product information of Sativex. So, thinking about hypersensitivity. So, somebody said I had a really bad trip once and I thought I should you know, go and jump off a balcony, you might suggest to them that this is not the best thing for them to do. Also, the excipient, so understanding how something, what carrier oil, those allergies I was talking about. Now, the known or suspected history or family history of schizophrenia or other psychotic illness. There is a really complex relationship between cannabis and schizophrenia. We are even investigating cannabidiol as an anti-psychotic. So, the real thing is though, given the narrow evidence base, if you have a patient who has had past psychosis, you would be a very brave person to be prescribing a THC product at the moment. Again, it is around the ability to work with a person with severe personality disorder, around cannabis prescribing and managing drug dependence and polypharmacy and cannabinoids are incredibly lipophilic and so if the person is breast feeding, you probably do not want to be prescribing cannabinoids. Similarly, pregnancy, not a particularly good idea. Precautions, so things that you want to think about are people, older people who if they get a mild or moderate dizziness may wind up falling over, so you can make somebody dizzy because you know, it is not uncommon. There are differences of opinion around THC and what the appropriate age is. There are rat models of rats being exposed to THC as adolescent rats and having brain development issues. There are cohort studies were there are concerns and again it is a chicken and an egg thing, are you using cannabis because you are more likely to have a problem, or do you have a problem because you are using cannabis. The Canadians suggest that it is inappropriate to use a THC containing product for those under 25, the Israelis are using some THC containing products for kids as young as five, but generally speaking, you probably do not want to be using a THC product in that age group. Cannabis can give some people a bit of a stress test, particularly THC and so if somebody has got serious cardiovascular disease, probably not the best thing. There have been you know, reports of acute stroke and acute AMI after using cannabis. But again, we have not got consistent concerns. You know, it is there, it is a possibility. So certainly not for unstable angina patients. For epilepsy and seizures, as I said for some people THC is proconvulsant so they will actually fit more with THC containing products, and again, generally with older people because, you know and delirium is bad news if you are an older person, and so giving somebody something that can cause a delirium is a concern. So, then different people will find THC, you know they will either feel good with it or they will feel terrible, you know two people same effect, one person’s happiness is another person’s misery. The pregnancy, we do not have a lot of safety data in pregnancy and again the work and driving issues. And even cannabidiol which is not going to be on the test, if you have got somebody who has previously been stable on all their medications, you put them on cannabidiol, it inhibits their metabolism of their benzodiazepine, they can suddenly be drowsy when they did not used to be. So it is important to remember that because they are a fairly new drug, sedation from normally, you know, from drugs that people are normally tolerating quite well, can occur including some tricyclic antidepressants for example. So, monitoring adverse effects. Something that the TGO will ask you about. It is about some effects that are common, especially the dizziness. It is important that people understand the oral absorption and the fact that it can take more than an hour to actually get an effect, because there are horror stories from doctors who initiated somebody and said we will just titrate it up gradually and the person took it, did not get any effect for half an hour, took another one and was starting to feel a little bit funny but did not think it was really working, took another one and wound up completely stoned and very unhappy at the end of that hour. So just to make sure patients are educated that it can take time for oral absorption to work. Again, drug levels of drugs that interact with the cytochrome P450 system, and recognising that you had one patient that tolerated a dose could be a completely different situation for the next patient. So there is a lot of person to person variability. We have talked about negotiating those clear outcomes, and there are some standard assessment tools. The Palliative Care Outcome Collaborative have got a really nice symptoms assessment scale for your palliative care patients, and that will also help you pick up on things, you know, your target symptom might have been anorexia and anxiety. But it will also pick up on anything else that is improving as part of the treatment that you are giving, and there is a whole wealth of information around pain diaries and monitoring chronic pain patients on the Agency for Clinical Innovations Chronic Pain Network site. Harry: One of the questions Jan, is how old is old? Jan: I think that is a really good question, and I think it comes sometimes back to physiological age, doesn’t it? So, if you have got a very frail 49-year-old, then they are a frail 49-year-old with lots of health conditions. If you have got an incredibly sturdy 70-year-old, you have got an incredibly sturdy 70-year-old. So, it is not a hard and fast rule as such, it is really though recognising that you know, the old-old are particularly vulnerable because we do not have the information and it is very much, you know, it is a therapeutic decision how old is old. It is not like I can say never prescribe to an over 85-year-old. I just wanted to talk through some myths and legends at the moment about cannabis prescribing, because I think these are the things we see in the media, we see picked up from people’s letters to us about what their concerns are. So I just wanted to try and put some of the myths and legends to bed. The first myth is that there is actually a list of conditions that will be approved. There is no set list of conditions. It is all about each case by case application to the TGA. It is about knowing that standard evidence based therapies have been tried and that the person who is making the application has thought about the likely efficacy of the product. You know, we have seen applications approved where the doctor has said, look you know, I have got very little evidence that it is likely to work, however I have thrown everything else. There is a theoretical benefit and I would like to try it for my very sick patient. I have seen those approved and I have seen other applications where somebody is very passionate about it and the TGA has been very concerned about what was being initiated when other therapies that were standard and routine had not been tried. So, there is no standard list. One of the other things patients get confused about is cannabis medicines and they are all synthetic. So, as I have discussed, there are a couple of synthetic medicines, but most medicines both the registered medicine nabiximols is plant derived. It has got traces of other cannabinoids terpenes and it is standard. Every time that patient gets that, they get exactly the same mixture. The goods imported under TGO 93 are plant derived and synthetic THC products. They are not commonly used in Australia. They are available, but they are not, TGA does not say no to plant. Pharmaceutical cannabis is more expensive than the black market, and I, you know, I am quite honest in saying that it is cheaper to grow things in your own back yard, just like it is cheap to go and harvest the bark off your own willow tree to get your aspirin. I would not recommend that. So, for palliative care indications, the cost could be as low as $3 to $10 a day. And I know that is a significant amount of money for some patients, but considering if they go down to the pub and try to buy a gram of cannabis a day or two grams of cannabis a day, they will be out of pocket a lot more than having a pharmaceutical grade product that you as a doctor have confidence in prescribing to them. My patient will die before they get approved. At the moment for palliative care patients with complete applications by their usual treating practitioner, we have got an average processing time of about six hours. So you put an application in at 6 o’clock one day, it will be approved by 4 o’clock the next day for sure. You cannot get high on medicinal cannabis and that is something that we see a lot promoted through the media. You can get high on medicinal cannabis. Sometimes we want you to get high on medicinal cannabis as a therapeutic effect. It does depend on the dose of THC. Cannabidiol can decrease the degree of euphoria or dysphoria, however on a 1:1 ratio cannabidiol and THC, 3% to 10% of patients on nabiximols still feel high. So it does not completely get rid of the sensation of intoxication. And we can if we give you enough nabiximols, make many, many people have an acute paranoid psychotic reaction. Which leads us on to you cannot die from a cannabis overdose. So, this is a bit like saying people who die in a drunk driving car accident have not died from their alcohol consumption. You can actually have such an altered behaviour that you do die from trauma, for example somebody has a hallucination that they are being chased by something and jump from a balcony. And we do know that overseas, that kids are getting admitted when they have consumed products that were either prescribed by a doctor that had an undisclosed THC content or where they have accessed some of their parent’s stash of edible gummies and so on, and so those kids have wound up seizing. They have wound up in ICU. They have wound up ventilated which to me is not too many steps from dying from a cannabis overdose. We also have had people who for example have been so delirious from self-administered cannabis medicines they have required admission because for example they needed their diabetes insulin and because they were so delirious that was not safe to be administered and so they have wound up admitted. So, again, they might not have died from the cannabis but you know, problems with DKA for example. So it is really about trying to say, yes they are fairly safe in large doses, but they are not completely safe, and as I say remembering that morbidity is not just from direct overdose it also from what happens. So, we have drawn a pretty complex maze at the moment so let us see if we can help get to the other end of the maze. So last December the Government announced that we were funding a cannabis medicines advisory service. It started operation in February. It has a clinical pharmacologist, so an expert in medicines and drug-drug interactions and has senior drug information pharmacists working there. It is a New South Wales Health service. It is free of charge. It is available to you 9-5 Monday to Friday and it is there to help. And they can help you with the latest evidence. They can help you through the regulatory environments. They can help you with tools to monitor progress. They can help you with dosing, titration. I have started my patient on this, this is happening I am not sure what to do, all of that – they are there to help. They are also very aware of which clinical trials are recruiting. So, if your patient is eligible for a clinical trial, they can help you refer your patient to a relevant clinical trial. They will even fill in your paper work for you. So, this is the email address, the telephone 49236200. They are there 9-5 Monday to Friday and they are there to help. They will usually help you the same day and if not it will be a next day service because depending on the volume of enquiries and depending on how unique your particular enquiry is, they go away and you have got a patient with a unique issue, they will go away and they will have a look in the literature for you, to you know, what evidence is there to use particular cannabinoid combination for this particular type of patient. And they have also got the network of the whole Hunter-New England Local Health District specialist network if they just need to ask a colleague who is a neurologist or something for some advice as well. So they are there to help. You have got a specialist drug person there to help you. We have also got the TGA guidance that we talked about last week. It has the systematic reviews of the evidence. It does not actually give you so much about use 2.5 mg twice a day for whatever, but it does give you some idea of where the wind is blowing as far as what to do and perhaps what not to do. And also, I am just mentioning the Australian Centre for Cannabinoid Clinical and Research Excellence, because we have provided quite a bit of funding to them. They are actually developing clinical guidelines, flow charts like the Canadian ones for Australian circumstances. They are also there to help with how the clinical trial will come out. How do we put that information into clinical practice? We have also funded them to be able to perform drug levels of cannabinoids and their metabolites. So if you ring the cannabis medicines advisory service who work hand in hand with ACRE, they are happy to work together with helping you if you need that particular thing. So a particular thing might be, I have got a patient, I have only given them a small dose. They are off their head. I want to know what is going on with them. Then they are there and they can help. You know, particularly if you know, things have been going quite well for a little while. It is not an instant service, it is more of a, you know, what has happened can I get some idea of what is happening. But again, the clinical pharmacologist is there to help understand it. I think that is me done. Harry: Well done. One of the questions is, if you have got a patient using black market cannabis, have we had any applications to use medicinal cannabinoids to presumably treat them and help them get off their high use of black market cannabis. Jan: So, nabiximols has been trialled in Sydney for cannabis withdrawal and reducing cannabis. If it is a straight substitution as a harm minimisation, we have not got the evidence yet that that is a reasonable thing to do. So if it is just a straight substitution because we have not got you know, like a methadone program for cannabis where you go from black market cannabis to lawful cannabis. However, if a patient has been using a product and if it has been grown in Australia, it is likely to be a high THC, low CBD product as we discussed at the last seminar, and they have had some benefit and say they were managing a particular symptom and you and perhaps their specialist in that symptom had an agreement that this was a useful thing, moving them on to a legal cannabis product is not such a bad idea, and probably you need a THC only product to start with because they are using a high THC product in the community. Or, you could move them on to a registered medicine like nabiximols and see if you got the same effect. So, we have certainly had people approved who have used unlawful cannabis products to self-medicate who were seeing success whose doctors supported their move to a lawful product for the same symptoms because they could see that it had benefitted that person. So it is not, it is actually evidence to support that that has happened, but at the same time, it is really about thinking about, is that the best move for that patient or are you just continuing a dependence condition when you should actually be discussing about how to stop. Harry: The other question that has come up is probably a more typical patient that GPs would see, which is the chronic non-cancer pain patient who has tried almost everything or has been on usually the opioids. Where would you put that sort of patient? Jan: And I think this is a really hard one. If we are talking about a patient with neuropathic pain, there is some evidence of benefit. There is also a significant, you know, bNNT to NNH ratio is not fantastic but then possibly a lot of other manoeuvres that have happened for that patient were not fantastic either. So, I am assuming that that person has probably been reviewed by a pain clinic or been participating in you know, all the other things, then it is there as if you like a last line to help. For the other non-neuropathic pain patients, the Faculty of Pain Medicine really recommends that this is probably not a place you want to go at the moment. They are suggesting that the potential harms are outweighing the benefits. So I am relying on the assessment of professional colleagues to suggest that looking at the evidence, the Faculty of Pain Medicine people say probably not for non-neuropathic pain, but again there is always exemptions to every rule, but it would have to be a fairly rare and special case. Harry: So even substituting out opiates for cannabinoids. Jan: We are not there yet. Look it is a really interesting area and people are really interested about the opiates varying effects of cannabinoids and I think that is a really interesting thing. What we have not got is really excellent RCT evidence regarding a standard chronic pain non-neuropathic pain patient and whether we are actually able to consistently reduce their dose of opiates. We have got conflicting evidence I think from population studies, where in some populations, use of cannabis reduces use of prescribed opiates, and then in other studies and it is self-report, and there are other studies where actually the person was not using that many opiates anyway when they started on the cannabis medicine when you got back to prescription reports. So what looks like a big decrease in self-report was actually not. They were already on a fairly low dose of opiates when they were personally substituting. We have had that interesting epidemiological phenomenon in America, where in some states where they have liberalised cannabis use the rate of opiate overdose has gone down, but at the same time usually when they liberalise cannabis use, they start clamping down on opiate prescribing so, you know is it because the liberalisation of cannabis came at the same time as a clamp on opiate prescribing? Is it the clamp on opiate prescribing that is decreasing the deaths or is it the cannabis? Or is it both? And we are not there yet, so I do not think the Faculty of Pain Medicine are there. Harry: I think that covers most of the questions that we have gotten for tonight’s presentation. Jan: Okay. Sammi: As you can see on your screen at the moment, they are the learning outcomes that we went through at the beginning of the session, so we hope that we have covered those for you. I just want to say a big thank you to Jan and Harry for presenting at this two part series. We hope you have all found it very interesting. Thank you all for joining and thank you again, Harry and Jan. Harry: Thank you.","Webinar summary. 30 May 2018. The cannabis medicines landscape is one that is ever-evolving.

As general practitioners, it is important to understand the prescribing pathways and authority requirements to prescribe and supply Schedule 8 (S8) cannabis medicines in line with legislative and legal frameworks. To assist NSW GPs in navigating cannabis medicines, the NSW&ACT RACGP has partnered with NSW Health on this webinar. This webinar provides a regulatory update to ensure prescribers of S8 cannabis medicines understand the requirements for when a NSW authority or exemption is required before prescribing or supplying. We also work through the ethical and legal responsibilities and liabilities that apply to general practitioners prescribing S8 cannabis medicines. Dr Harry Nespolon Dr Jan Fizzell Ms Judith Mackson     
Sammi: Good evening everybody and welcome to this evenings new regulatory approach to Schedule 8 cannabis medicines webinar. My name is Samantha and I will be your host for this evening. Before we start, I would like to make an Acknowledgement of Country. We recognise the traditional custodians of the land and sea on which we live and work and we pay our respects to Elders past and present. So before we jump in I would just like to introduce our facilitator and presenters for this evening. So, our facilitator this evening is Dr Harry Nespolon. So, as I am sure most of you are aware Harry is the current President of the RACGP. He has also been a Quality Assurance Examiner for the OSCE component of the Fellowship Exams for over 10 years. And our presenters, Dr Jan Fizzell and presenter Judith Mackson. So Jan is a Public Health Physician working as a Medical Advisor in the Office of the Chief Health Officer at the New South Wales Ministry of Health. She has been working on facilitating the New South Wales Clinical Trials Program for medicinal cannabis and cannabis-derived products and assisting in cannabis therapeutic policy development in New South Wales. Jan also has a keen interest in health technology assessment and population-based screening programs. Thanks for joining us, Jan. And then onto Judith. So, as New South Wales Chief Pharmacist, Judith manages regulation of medicines and poisons with the administration of the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Administration, and provides technical and policy advice to the health system. Judith’s professional interests encompass evidence-based health policy and medicines regulation, quality use of medicines, drug utilisation and health outcomes research, and clinical guideline implementation. So, thank you Harry, Jan and Judith for joining us this evening. I will now hand over to Harry to take us through our learning outcomes for this evening. Harry: Good evening everyone. I hope this will be a very interesting new look at cannabis in New South Wales, especially with the recent changes. So by the end of this QI and CPD activity you should be able to identify the new requirements for authority to prescribe Schedule 8 cannabis medicines in New South Wales. List the group of patients for which approval from New South Wales Health must be sought to prescribe Schedule 8 cannabis medicines, discuss ethical and legal responsibilities and liabilities that apply to prescribers when using unregistered medicines with patients who are drug dependent or who are under 16 years of age, and as important is to source clinical support and advice when considering prescribing a cannabis medicine. I will now hand over to Jan. Jan: Thanks. So, we have had some recent developments in regulation around cannabis medicines in New South Wales, so we would like to take you back through how you can access cannabis medicines. We will talk you through how we have changed the regulations. We will help you understand how you can apply for an authority to prescribe. We will also talk you through some prescribing considerations for patient groups. Also, some things that you need to know about prescriptions and dispensing and also where to get that clinical advice and information. So all medical practitioners have the ability to legally prescribe a cannabis medicine for a patient if they believe it is an appropriate treatment option. And GPs are definitely people who are key to this. We really want to emphasise the fact that the patient’s current treating medical practitioner is the most appropriate person to prescribe for this patient. There is no pre-determined list of conditions. It is really between you and your patient and the evidence to work out whether this is something that is appropriate for this patient. And there are legal access pathways to unregistered medicines under the Therapeutic Goods Act. These are not exclusive to cannabis. They are for all unregistered medicines and they can be accessed through a clinical trial, through an Authorised Prescriber Scheme, through the Special Access Scheme which is the most common way for people accessing cannabis medicines and I would like to emphasise that the TGA does not charge to make an application to them for the Special Access Scheme, nor does New South Wales Health. So we have a number of different cannabis medicines available for doctors to prescribe. There is one registered cannabis medicine in Australia and that is Sativex (nabiximols). It is the only one on the ARTG and it is registered for spasticity and multiple sclerosis. All the other cannabis medicines you can access are unregistered medicines so their use can be considered experimental. We do not have the same sorts of product information available that has been approved by a regulator that has looked at the safety and efficacy and different conditions or what side effects different people could get, or even good drug monographs telling us about the drug interactions. So it is really important that you get good advice about what you are prescribing to particular patients. They are not subsidised on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, because one of the absolute prerequisites for getting onto the PBS is that it needs to be a registered medicine. We have found in the last 12 months that there are many different products coming to market and even for very similar products, the prices can vary significantly and also the amount that a pharmacy is going to charge a patient to handle that medicine can change significantly. So, these are things that we have very little influence over, but as doctors you can become informed by the Cannabis Medicines Advisory Service. But given that putting an application in to get these medicines prescribed does mean that you are transmitting personal information for your patient, it is probably a good time to talk about potential costs with your patients before you share information on products. At the moment, there are typical medicines that could cost around $3 to $5 a day if treating someone on a standard dose for pain. But if you were using a medicine that has got a very high cannabidiol content such as we have used for kids with epilepsy, that can be as high as $130 to $150 a day. So it is a huge spectrum depending on what drug you are prescribing and then there are those on costs as I discussed. The other thing to be aware of, the number of cannabis companies that are supplying software to assist people in prescribing cannabis medicines. So again if you are transmitting your patient’s personal information, please be careful to ensure that your patient has given consent for their information to be shared that way. And I will just give you an overview of the regulation amendment. So on the 30th September this year there was an amendment to the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Regulation. It means now that only a Therapeutic Goods Administration issues approval is required in most cases. So for most patients, the protections that are needed for you know, what are classed as high risk medicines in these categories is adequate through the TGA’s oversight. The new regulation in summary is that New South Wales Health authority is only needed when prescribing or supplying a Schedule 8 cannabis medicine that is to a drug dependent person for a clinical trial where it is an unregistered cannabis medicine, or to a child aged under 16 years, and in this case the 16 years is the legal definition. So the Regulation Amendment in New South Wales alone does not affect the requirement for doctors to still need an approval from the Therapeutic Goods Administration to prescribe an unregistered cannabis medicine as opposed to a registered medicine. The TGA considers issues such the prescriber’s expertise, suitability of the medicine to treat the condition and the quality of the medicine. And hence they ask questions about those issues. The application process itself has not changed itself as a result of the New South Wales Regulation Amendment. And we encourage that the TGA’s online system is used for Special Access Scheme applications as it offers a streamlined process. The TGA’s website is used to access that portal. So again, the criteria, the particularly relevant criteria are prescribing or supplying for a drug dependent person requires an authority, and prescribing or supplying for a child aged under 16 years is particularly important. Authorities that were issued before the 30th September remain valid. We have contacted doctors who had authorities in progress and should have dealt with them individually with you. And it is important to note that New South Wales Health authority is not needed to prescribe a Schedule 4 cannabis medicine which is essentially a cannabidiol only product. So one of the things that people are often curious about is, well what is the definition of a drug dependent person? And we would point out in New South Wales, this is not just about cannabis medicines, it is actually about other Schedule 8 medicines. So this is not a rule for cannabis medicines that is different. This is about coordinating care to a vulnerable group of patients who are drug dependent. And so it is a legal definition. It is a person who has acquired an overpowering desire for the continued administration of a drug of addiction, or a prohibited drug as a result of repeated administration of that drug. So when people then say, so how do we define that? It is about that craving or strong desire to use the drug. It is that prioritising the drug use over other things that you would normally do in your life. There is a loss of control over the drug use such as using escalating doses of the drugs so that they can get the same effect. And it is that continued use despite harm or negative consequences. One of the key groups that you can more readily identify are those people who are on the Opioid Treatment Program and they are considered to be drug dependent just because part of that qualification to be on that treatment program. And again, I would emphasise that this is not unique to cannabis. People who are using oxycodone, fentanyl or morphine, these are all drugs for which you need an authority to prescribe to a drug dependent person. And it is really important that we do not fragment people’s care, particularly people who are drug dependent because we do know that there are some people who are reading the literature about maybe this is going to help me wean my opiate use or maybe this is going to change things for me. And so it is really important that we do not send people off to get different care from somebody else and that all the prescribers are on the same page. So the prescriptions for a registered or an unregistered Schedule 8 medicine does not need to bear a New South Wales Authority number. However if it is a compounded medicine, so that is something that the TGA has not actually always had a hand in. Judith, I am just looking at my colleague, Judith. They still require an authority and we see things like ketamine lozenges in the community and other things like that. They actually, if it is happening in the community, it requires an authority for that to occur. The Authority number is still required for some Schedule 8 medicines so that is things like psychostimulants used in the treatment of ADHD, so the requirement has not gone completely again, we are not treating cannabis very differently. Some Schedule 8 medicines do need it, some Schedule 8’s do not and if you are ever concerned it is easy to contact us to find out. And the prescribers need to specify all the usual requirements on a prescription for a Schedule 8 prescription. So that is the directions for use, the quantity in words and figures, the repeat intervals and only one item on a particular prescription. And that is to try and limit the opportunities for fraudulent behaviour. The really important thing is we are now starting to see computer generated prescriptions that can put out a prescription but it does not actually meet those requirements and some of them would be actually quite easy to alter from how it is generated. So you really must be careful to think about how your computer software is formatting your prescriptions. And again, as for anything that we do for our patients, we need to make a record of what we have prescribed, how we have prescribed it and what we expect to have happen. So this is our service that the New South Wales has funded to help doctors. It is free, it is focussed on giving you information for your particular patient and it is evidence-based clinical advice. It is available to any practitioner in New South Wales, or anyone caring for a New South Wales patient. So if you are in the border areas you can certainly call them about people who are resident in New South Wales. It is available Monday to Friday 9 to 5. It has got an email address and a phone number. There is also a number of documents that you can access that can give you additional information. There is the TGA guidance documents which were written on the base of a significant evidence review. And then also, New South Wales Health has sponsored the NHMRC seat for the Australian Centre for Cannabinoid Clinical and Research Excellence and giving you some prescribing guidance which tends to combine the steps that you might have taken before you get to a cannabis medicine along with information about what is the evidence for the different cannabis medicines available for a particular health condition. So some people are starting to ask about the opiate treatment program process, and so when somebody meets the definition of drug dependent we will check our records and we will find who the OTP prescriber is. If the OTP prescriber and a cannabis medicine prescriber are the same person, we assume they know what they are doing. However if there is more than one person starting to prescribe drugs of addiction for a particular patient, we will try and get the two different prescribers to come together to develop a treatment plan for that patient so that there is not a conflict in aims and goals of the two different prescribers. And the prescriber can always ring us to ask about patients who may be on the OTP if they are not sure. Harry: And that is available quite readily. So if I ring up New South Wales Health Pharmaceutical Regulatory Unit with a patient in front of me, you can tell me whether they are on the OTP list or not. Jan: Yes. So that is the easiest way to check, apart from having a patient who discloses. But you do not have to ring us about every patient by any stretch of the imagination, it is only the ones for whom you may have some concerns. So we basically, as I say, we wind up with a treatment plan for that patient and the authority will be issued. So this is one of the types of scenarios that we have had here. So Doug who is 57 goes to his regular GP for his OTP requirements. He has been stable on methadone for a number of years but he has still got some very bad back pain from a work injury and he has been self-medicating with THC which he feels is helping his pain. He seeks advice from a GP who advertises as being willing to prescribe cannabis of part of a clinic, who has put in a request to prescribe for Doug. Now, because Doug meets the legal definition of a drug dependent person, the GP prescriber will need the authority to prescribe to Doug. And it is really important here that Doug’s usual treating team also knows that Doug is seeking this cannabis prescription because if we have not had that conversation between the different care givers, the person who is running this clinic may or may not know if that THC use has been of concern to the GP or has been part of a de-escalation process of opiates. So generally if an alternate prescriber wants to prescribe the cannabis medicine to Doug we will make sure that the OTP knows about it. If Doug’s OTP says, yes I know about it, I sent him over to that clinic, they have been good to him, no problems, your authority is likely to be granted. If his OTP prescriber is concerned however, we will keep having a chat to the doctor who wants to prescribe to Doug and sometimes that new prescriber if they are trained and ready to do OTP, they will take over Doug’s care and manage both issues. However, Doug’s OTP prescriber has worked with Doug regarding his pain and he has taken the responsibility for introducing the THC medicine with regular monitoring of progress and dosage. He has a care plan with his treatment target all across both programs. So we have got Doug being looked after by his usual carers and that is probably the best outcome for somebody like Doug. Now, Maisie is a different kettle of fish. She is a 40-year-old lady who has been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. She has just seen a rheumatologist, been commenced on methotrexate. Her rheumatologist has prescribed a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory to help with pain and morning stiffness. But she has come to you as her GP asking for a prescription for a cannabis medicine as she hopes that by using a more natural medicine, and this is something that is really important to a lot of people who are interested in cannabis medicines, they feel it is natural so it will not have side effects and it will not have problems. But what we have found it when the GP talks to Maisie, what is actually really worrying her, is actually that she has seen that the methotrexate is a chemotherapy agent and she is really scared about that and somebody else told her, did you not see that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can give you a heart attack? And so she is basically really worried about what is going on. So like all good GPs they looked after Maisie. They talked to her about methotrexate and that is a much lower dose for rheumatoid arthritis. They will keep looking at her for the side effects and they will try and wean her from the anti-inflammatory medicines as soon as it is appropriate. Maisie’s GP also looks at the literature which shows that cannabinoids may have a place in therapy for rheumatoid arthritis patients, but the evidence is weak. Now Maisie is really at the beginning of her treatment journey, so this is probably not the time to add in any experimental treatment, and she has actually got quite a few lines of treatment to go before you want to be reaching for experimental treatment. And unlike some of the more modern therapies, biological agents we do not yet have good evidence that cannabinoids will actually modify disease activity in any way. And so her GP looks after her, talks through her current treatment and says that when the time comes we will talk about the cannabis medicine then. So it is not taken off the table it is just a reassurance that it is expensive, it is experimental and we have got other things for you first. So, this is something that most GPs will not come into contact with, with the clinical trials although we are seeing some primary care clinical trials using cannabis medicines. So if it is a proper clinical trial with clinical trial notification to the TGA, you also need to get a clinical trial notification and an authority from us to prescribe. And there is a form that you can use directly from the New South Wales Health website, but also if your patients are asking you about clinical trials, we have seen some very loose terminology I think it is fair to say around cannabis medicine and what is a clinical trial and is it a clinical trial if I use the Special Access Scheme to treat one patient and record the outcomes? So if you wanted to know what are the clinical trials that have gone through an ethics committee and been registered through the normal process, you can always look at the Australian and New Zealand Clinical trials registry and also that is a place where if you have got a patient who is interested in what else can I do for my condition, it could help. So again, this is not unique to cannabis medicines. Outside of health legislation there is also protections for children so that we do not have some of the things that may have happened in past years where children were exposed long term to benzodiazepines or other S8 medications without having a very good treatment plan and appropriate care. So we are working really hard to make sure that children who are being prescribed a cannabis medicine, that it is being done in a thoughtful manner and our colleagues over at the Department of Communities and Justice who were previously Families and Community Services, are responsible for having this legislation that protects children. So generally, when your application to treat a child comes through the TGA they will forward it to New South Wales Health if the date of birth indicates that the person is under the age of 16. We then write to the Secretary of FACS and say can you please approve this. It can take up to 21 days for that approval to come through, but it has been coming through much more rapidly, usually two weeks. So it is really important though that it is understood that is a necessary process because we know that there are a lot of people who are interested in the S4 and the S8 medicines for the intractable childhood epilepsies, managing behavioural symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, the behavioural symptoms of ADHD and Tourette’s syndrome. Now, we would say however that the evidence for use in many of these areas apart from childhood epilepsy is really very limited. It tends to be case series type evidence, very few randomised control trials have been reported. We do need to make sure that there is care around the delta-9 THC in the kids because the THC containing medicines are the S8 medicines. I would say that there are a number of preparations out there which are S8 medicines because they have got the 1 mg of THS and 20 mg of cannabidiol. What can happen really rapidly though, is children can get exposed to quite a high dose of THC if they are being given the therapeutic dose of cannabidiol, so for epilepsy where we have got 20 mg a kilogram of cannabidiol you can very easily get up to that 30 mg of THC which is what we would expect an adult to have as a maximum each day. We also know that there has been concerns from free clinical and observational studies about THC development on the brain and we can see the day coming when there is going to be community concern similar to the dexamphetamine and ADHD type concerns. So we really need to make sure that as this drug which may be promising and may be helpful, does not become so restricted because people are concerned. So we want to make sure that the controls are similar to those for stimulants in the management of ADHD, however non-paediatricians have been able to prescribe the cannabis medicines at this time and our experience is that if there is an inadequate reason given on the application to the TGA about why a medicine might be used at this point, that there will be further questions asked by the Department of Communities and Justice. So this is just to give you a couple of examples of how cannabis medicines may be used in children. So, Sally who is four years old has one of these terrible refractory epilepsy conditions and her parents would like to try cannabis medicine for her. She has been on many anti-epileptic drugs, a ketogenic diet. They have given her some control but she is still having regular drop seizures. So her paediatrician talking to her paediatric neurologist says okay to the parents, a cannabidiol medicine could be trialled. Her parents provide financial and informed consent and she is started on an escalating dose of cannabidiol. Now the really important part of the GP is to be part of this treatment triad between the paediatrician and neurologist and the GP where the GP can particularly monitor Sally’s liver function tests and discuss any issues around drug-drug interactions. So if the GP becomes concerned that she is much, much more drowsy than at any other encounter they have had previously, it is a good time to signal that there might be something going on. Now, because these are Schedule 4 medicines, we do not need a New South Wales authority or exemption but Sally’s GP cannot take over the prescribing without doing the same process through the Special Access Scheme through the TGA to become her primary prescriber. And if you would like some information around the clinical evidence for epilepsy, it is one of the best studies areas and the review is in the TGA guidance. Lachlan is based on another case were we see often, where parents are coming to the end of their rope I guess trying to look after and care for a child with severe behavioural disorders connected to their autism spectrum disorder and his mum, despite all her best efforts of following all the advice, she is really worried for her personal safety and for Lachlan’s safety. They are living in a rural area. Some services you just cannot get to. And of course Grandma, because she loves Lachlan is saying look there are miracle changes being reported in the news. What can we do to help Lachlan? And so they have come to you as the GP seeking help and you as their rural GP has been the person who is looking after this family. You know this family well. So after talking to Lachlan’s paediatrician, getting advice from the Cannabis Medicines Advisory Service, the GP in this case was willing to prescribe and unregistered cannabis medicine that contained THC, because even though there are concerns about brain developments, it was also where the best evidence was that it would impact his behaviour. So the GP gave written and informed consent from Lachlan’s mother having explained risks, benefits, possible costs and written informed consent in this case because we are transmitting information and it is an experimental treatment that you have got for your child. The GP applied through the SAS portal of the TGA. That automatically gets sent through to New South Wales Health for us to process due to the S8 medicine and Lachlan’s age. And then we send it over to the Department of Communities and Justice. So Communities and Justice make sure that Lachlan is not actually in care or a child of concern, and they can see that he has been well looked after by his GP, paediatrician, the justification for treating him with this medicine is clear, and so they issue the exemption. We send that on to the GP. TGA approval is provided by the TGA and the GP initiated the therapy along the dosing regimen described in an Israeli study. And so again that was a case series but I know that when we have very little in the way of evidence, a case series might be the best thing we have to hang our hat on at the moment. And also they talked about what the family could expect to see as far as behavioural change. What was acceptable? So, one of the things that is coming up now that we are seeing, often cannabis medicine companies sponsor cannabis clinics setting up. Now the GPs within those clinics are making their own decisions about what they prescribe but it should be you know, said that there are vested interests sometimes behind the provision of these clinics. And it is really important to know that we really are encouraging people to think very carefully about where we are referring people and if you as a GP do not want to prescribe a medicine, being really clear about what that reason is, because we are also hearing reasons that we are hoping to address tonight, like it costs too much money to apply to the TGA. It costs nothing as far as monetarily goes, but of course it costs time and effort and energy to apply to the TGA. People are concerned that if they prescribe a cannabis medicine for one patient they will then be the cannabis doctor for everybody. So there are lots of really appropriate reasons sometimes, or sometimes you could really say to somebody, the evidence is just not good. The clinical guidance is that this is not the right next step for you. But it is really important to be quite honest in why that is happening. So, if you are looking after a patient in a hospital, you do not need a new authority to keep prescribing to that patient in hospital. If however that patient leaves the hospital and you are going to take over and write a prescription you will need a new authority from the TGA. So this is not an unusual situation in many places where somebody is providing palliative care for somebody with metastatic breast cancer and she is having her terminal care at a local health facility. The palliative care specialist has commenced and added a cannabis medicine to her medications to help with symptom control. She has found that it helps her sleep and manage her pain and talking to the local health district Drugs and Therapeutics Committee which is a government step with in a New South Wales health facility. Barbara’s GP VMO can continue to prescribe that medicine while she is an inpatient including the dose adjustment and the hospital will generally use Barbara’s own medication at this point. So the only time the GP would need to apply to the TGA is if they wanted to change the product, so say Barbara was on a low THC high cannabidiol product but they wanted to alter the amount of different things, that is when we would need to get a new application through to the TGA, through the Special Access Scheme. But also, if she is admitted to hospital and you feel very strongly that it may not be helping her, it might not be the right thing, it is really important to have that conversation with Barbara or her family if Barbara is not able to have that conversation, about why you do not want to keep prescribing the medicine. And again, it just needs that honest conversation. And if Barbara’s GP needs assistance in managing the cannabis medicine because they are feeling uncertain for themselves, that is what the Cannabis Medicines Advisory Service is there to help with. Or again, Barbara’s palliative care specialist who started the medicine in the first place. One of the things that we get in correspondence quite a lot is patients being told that they need to be referred to a special cannabis clinic. That is not true. It is really important that their usual practitioners are looking after them. We would say that we know that these are not always staffed with experts. They are not always GPs, they are not always specialists in the diseases and some of them will only consult by Telehealth. So, again it comes back to that good medical practice obligation we have were we take reasonable steps to ensure that the people we delegate to or refer to or hand over, have the qualifications, experience, knowledge and skills to provide the care required. And it is a huge difference across the different clinics with how they are staffed, what their model of care is. So, if a patient comes to you with a piece of paper saying I want to be off to a cannabis clinic, please do remember that the TGA is actually relying on you as their GP to be providing that ongoing care and they will say that I am consulting with the GP about this patient’s care. So you need to be comfortable that the person you are consulting with is a person that you are willing to keep working with. The other thing is, that the cannabis clinics can also be a source of employment. So please, if you are going to go and work in a cannabis clinic, do make sure you know about the entire breadth of products available and make treatment and product recommendations based on your best clinical judgement. It is just common good medical practice but it is really important. So, where to get help? So, if you are a medical practitioner and you would like to know about using a cannabis medicine to treat your patient, the New South Wales Cannabis Medicines Advisory Service is there to help you through those clinical steps, the different medicines and even some of the pricing information that they have been able to obtain from suppliers. If you want to know about the whole authority process, you have got a child you want to prescribe to, you have got a patient that you think is on the OTP, the Pharmaceutical Regulatory Unit is there to help. And there is a whole website where we have got most of this information available to you. I think that is us back at the learning outcomes. Harry: So we might just take a few questions now. If we go back to Maisie, if the GP or even the specialist applied for some medicinal cannabis, given that she had not gone through all the therapeutic steps, would she have gotten an authority? Jan: Quite probably from the TGA. They would have said you and the specialist together have consulted, you have thought about what the next step on this patient’s treatment journey is. And so they are not going to second guess the clinical team who are looking after her, and so that is a reasonable thing. Harry: One of the common questions is, can someone drive when they are taking medicinal cannabis? Jan: And this is one of the ages at the moment unfortunately. So one of the problems for people taking any drug that can cause impairment is that it is actually illegal to drive while you are impaired. So it does not matter whether you have taken morphine, amitriptyline, Phenergan over the counter from the chemist. If you drive while you are impaired by that drug it is actually unlawful, and you will have trouble with your insurance. The difference is, for cannabis people will actually test you at the roadside, and there is an assumption that at the level that you can have the cannabinoid detected in the saliva, it is likely that you will be impaired. So whilst it is a presence offence like any other test, you actually have to get over a particular threshold for the test to be positive. And the advice that we have had from experts and the advice may change, but at the moment the advice we have had from experts is, the therapeutic range in people’s blood when they are finding that a drug is helpful, and the level at which the swab test is being done overlap significantly. So it is really hard for us to make a good argument that it is safe for somebody on a cannabis medicine. We also have information that you are less likely to habituate to the effects of a cannabis medicine. So that is good because you are not escalating the dose constantly like you might do with an opioid, but at the same time you are not getting any better at driving. So this is one of the problems that we are still learning and still finding out about with cannabis medicines and we are constantly talking to experts in the field to give us advice so that we can move forward. Harry: So the follow up question is, so if they are on a CBD only drug, if there is or a combination, does that get them past the THC test on the side of the road? Jan: So the answer is, if you go on cannabidiol and you are impaired, you might not get picked up by the side of the road, but you have still got a problem, but you will not get picked up. Assuming you are taking a cannabidiol only Schedule 4 medicine. And when I say that, some people are importing questionably, cannabidiol products from overseas where you can go into a shop and buy them. Now the problem is, the ones overseas are not quality controlled. The FDA every year put out a whole lot of warnings about things that you have brought from the American States for example, some of which have high levels of THC, some of which have got very little CBD so you are just buying very expensive olive oil. So unless it is a product that has actually been batch tested by the TGA, a cannabidiol that is a Schedule 4 medicine, I would be really careful about what I did with any cannabinoid that I bought. Harry: Now the other regular question is about do, well the question is, does illicit cannabinoids cause schizophrenia? Do we know anything about medicinal cannabinoids and schizophrenia because I actually was at a talk last week and the answer was, it is a bit of a catch 22. People who are likely to be along that journey of schizophrenia are more likely to be using cannabinoids from a variety of sources, so whether that actually brings out schizophrenia in that group or not is open to debate. But do we have any evidence one way or the other? Jan: So if we look at the Nabiximols product information, we know that when we escalate to a certain dose more and more people have a psychosis. So they are not schizophrenic, they are having a temporary psychosis. But how often that happens, how often that happens when a dose has been carefully escalated I am not sure. But the other thing is, in mouse models of schizophrenia, we know that cannabidiol for example helps ameliorate some of the disturbing behaviour and we are starting to see early studies, so we have not got good evidence, but we are starting to hope that some of the cannabinoids may actually moderate some of those effects. But are we there to hand out cannabidiol in every psych ward in Australia? Absolutely not. Judith: And the other challenge is because with the unregistered products, they have not been subjected to any trials in humans at all, and certainly long term studies. We do not actually know what happens in cohorts of patients who are using the unregistered medicines so it is also highly uncertain. Harry: So one of the questions here is, can you just ring the TGA or do you have to apply online? Jan: Sadly the TGA do not have a prescription express. They made a huge concession to the 21st Century by going online and the online is available. Harry: And just to be crystal clear, you just cannot write a “private script” for medicinal cannabinoids, you do need to still apply through the TGA to get an authority to supply the S8 drug. Jan: Yes, here in Australia. Harry: Alright. I think that covers most of the sort of general questions. Sam. Sammi: We might give a couple of minutes for participants if they have got any more questions that we have not yet gotten to. There is one that has come through about jurisdiction restrictions, travelling interstate with cannabis, how that may? Jan: So, crossing borders, not a problem with cannabis that has been lawfully prescribed in Australia. Travelling overseas is a whole different kettle of fish because unlike opiates which you would still be very careful about some of the countries that you travel with your prescribed opiates with your prescription with your doctor’s letter, because the status of cannabis medicines are different in different locations I would be enquiring with the embassy of the country to which you wish to travel before you left Australia with it. Similarly, being able to bring cannabis into Australia is a very tricky proposition. We are a bit restricted by international conventions around this, so if you got a whole lot of cannabis prescribed on Venice Beach and tried to bring it back, because it has actually not been lawfully prescribed and dispensed in the United States of America, it has just been lawfully authorised and sold to you as opposed to there you would not be able to bring it back. However, if you had had your cannabis medicine lawfully prescribed and dispensed in say Germany where they have a similar system to us, my understanding is, assuming you could fly straight from Germany, which I do not think Qantas has managed yet, so we have got the intermediary countries where it could be a problem, I understand you could have that. But that is only that supply for that very short period of time. Judith: And patients and their doctors can find some information on the Commonwealth Office of Drug Control website and also on the New South Wales Health Ministry of Health website, as far as we can give the advice. Although as Jan said, the problem is that it is the laws of another country. Harry: Talking about another country. Let us talk about Victoria, is one of the questions. I gather that in Victoria you still need your State Department’s authority before you can prescribe a drug, so dual regulation, so the TGA and Victorian. Jan: They have got the streamlined process as well in Victoria where you only apply to the TGA and then I am really sorry, not being a Victorian bureaucrat I cannot talk so much with their information. But they have a similar, they have got a medicinal cannabis unit in the Victorian Department of Health and if you seek information about what you need to know in Victoria from there, it is generally either in the Chief Pharmacist Unit or a Medicinal Cannabis Unit in most states and territories to assist you. Harry: So I have learnt something tonight. I thought it was only in New South Wales being progressive when it came to cannabinoid prescribing. So we are getting a few questions about different states. I think it probably be better that people spoke to their local. Jan: Absolutely. Most Department of Health websites in the different jurisdictions have got clear information for you about the processes. So I would really encourage you, just google cannabis medicine Queensland Department of Health, cannabis medicine Western Australia Department of Health, and hopefully you will get to the right people. Harry: And we might make this the last question. It is about palliative care. The doctor asks if a patient has got severe pain in palliative care, do they still need to go through the TGA to prescribe? Judith: Yes. If it is an unregistered medicine, yes. The other pathway is called the Special Access Scheme category A, but it is only available when you import the product, so it is an unhelpful pathway to give in palliative care because it is a more difficult process. So yes. And with the streamlined application process through the portal, it really is relatively straight forward. So it is a delay but it is not a particular delay and I know the TGA are very responsive that if there is a particular urgency, they have been very responsive is my understanding. Harry: I have heard that they will give authority within hours usually. Judith: Absolutely. Harry: And I guess the last question is, do we know what the state of the industry is in Australia at the moment? I hear that there are a few companies that are producing Australian cannabinoids. Do we know about that? Jan: So my understanding is there are Australian companies that are producing cannabinoids and are producing them in standard formats and they are drugs that people are accessing through Special Access Scheme category B. They have got the same processes and quality control as the overseas imported medicines. And I think, as I say, it is not like you can pick up a TGA regulator approved product information sheet. So it is about really understanding what you are prescribing and being ready to understand that because cannabinoids get absorbed differently from person to person, some people are more sensitive. It is like any other medicine. It is just that we do not have our nice product monograph to go back to, to help us when something has gone a little bit different and I was very sorry to people in our other states, in New South Wales you can ring the Cannabis Medicines Advisory Service if you have concerns. Harry: Okay. Sammi: There is actually one more question that just came through Jan regarding the TGA website and going between that and New South Wales Health. I do not know how familiar you are with sites and assuming you probably work with them quite often, whether you can offer any guidance about navigation. Jan: So once you have registered with the TGA portal which I can understand any new registration process can be a struggle. But once you are registered, the difference is once you are in there and once you have prescribed once, it makes it much easier for you to prescribe again, particularly if you are prescribing for the same patient or if you prescribing for a different patient with a similar condition. So, my understanding from people who have used the portal, I have to say I am sorry I am a public health physician so I am the last person who should be prescribing cannabis medicines, but my understanding is from the palliative care specialists I have spoken to and some of the GPs who have worked with the system, is once you are in the system it is not hard to use. But getting in, and I take your point, we will try our best. Sammi: Great. So that does wrap us up for this evening. I would like to thank Jan, Judith and Harry for joining us tonight. Thank you very much everybody for joining us and enjoy the rest of your evening.","Oct 30, 2019 ...

RACGP President Dr Bastian Seidel said a consistent national regulatory framework for prescribing medicinal cannabis products would help ensure patient welfare is at the centre of this difficult and rapidly evolving area of medicine. “The current process of prescribing medicinal cannabis products in Australia differs significantly in every state and territory, which does not make sense,” Dr Seidel said. “Australia’s state health ministers must agree on a nationally consistent regulatory framework that will create a single-step approval process. This will significantly benefit frustrated GPs and their patients. “While the regulatory and prescribing regime must be robust to ensure only appropriate clinical access within the confines of the legislation, patients and doctors should not have to jump through hoops and wait months to access a drug that may improve a patient’s quality of life.” Dr Seidel urged the health ministers to implement the RACGP’s recommendations at the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) meeting next month. “Our political leaders have an opportunity to implement a framework that will cut the red tape that is currently strangling the process for specialist GPs and their patients. “This has the potential to improve patient safety and reduce variation because of different jurisdictional processes of states and territories. “It is about time we make this work for all Australians, regardless of where they live.” Dr Seidel said the role of specialist GPs must be carefully considered in the development of a national consistent framework for prescribing medicinal cannabis products. “It is unclear how, or whether, general practice will be included in this framework,” Dr Seidel said. “The current regulatory complexities and differences between states and territories around accessing medicinal cannabis products are significant barriers for GPs. “GPs are the first port of call for Australian patients, so they have a vital role to play in this important medical issue and rapidly evolving area of medicine. “GPs are specialists, and those who wish to prescribe medicinal cannabis products should be treated like any other specialist, and in partnership with patients, have the autonomy to determine when it is appropriate to prescribe to eligible patients. “If I have a patient, who has tried all standard treatment options without success, I should be able to consider prescribing medicinal cannabis as a viable treatment option without having to wait months.” For further information about the RACGP position statement for the regulatory framework for medicinal use of cannabis products visit the RACGP website.","Mar 6, 2018 ...

The RACGP has released the statement ahead of the 1 November introduction of Commonwealth legislation that will make medicinal cannabis a controlled prescription drug.

RACGP President Dr Bastian Seidel said the statement will help GPs to manage a potential increase in requests for medicinal cannabis. 

“Recent changes to the legislation may have created an incorrect perception of easy access to cannabis products”, he said.

“GPs may experience greater patient demand to prescribe cannabis-based medications. 

“Further evidence is still needed, particularly relating to treatment efficacy and the longer term side-effects of cannabis-based drugs.

As is the case with all medications, cannabis products must be approved or registered through the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) before they can be prescribed.

“The current evidence-base for the use of cannabis-based medicines is still emerging, and these products can be prescribed only under strict protocols,” said Dr Seidel.

As general practitioners, it is important to understand the most recent clinical evidence for cannabis medicines use, and the legislative and legal framework around their prescription. To assist NSW GPs in navigating cannabis medicines, the NSW&ACT RACGP has partnered with NSW Health to deliver a two-part webinar series Understanding Cannabis Medicines (Part One): Current Evidence and Availability and Understanding Cannabis Medicines (Part Two): Prescribing in General Practice. Understanding Cannabis Medicines (Part One): Current Evidence and Availability is designed to update GPs on the current landscape regarding cannabis medicines, including how they work, the available evidence for use for different health conditions and precautions for use. Dr Harry Nespolon Dr Jan Fizzell     
Sammi: Good evening everybody and welcome to this evening’s twilight online Cannabis Medicines Part 1: Current Evidence and Availability. My name is Samantha and I am your host for this evening. Before we get started, I would like to make a quick Acknowledgement of Country. We recognise the traditional custodians of the land and sea on which we live and work and we pay our respects to elders past and present. Okay, I would like to introduce our presenters for this evening, Dr Harry Nespolon and Dr Jan Fizzell. Harry is the current Chair of Sydney North PHN and Principal of two general practices in Sydney. Harry is also a Fellow of the RACGP and a Quality Assurance Examiner for the OSCE Fellowship Exam and has been doing that for the last 10 years. Jan is a public health physician, working as a medical advisor in the Office of the Chief Health Officer at the New South Wales Ministry of Health. She has been working on facilitating the New South Wales clinical trials program for medicinal cannabis and cannabis-derived products and assisting in cannabis therapeutics policy development in New South Wales. So welcome, Harry and Jan. Harry: Thank you. Sammi: I will hand over to Harry now to take you through the learning outcomes for this evening. Harry: Welcome everyone. My name is Harry Nespolon. I will be facilitating tonight’s webinar. I just quickly want to go through the learning outcomes that we are trying to achieve. By the end of the online CPD activity, you should be able to identify the difference between medicinal cannabis and elicit cannabis products, explain how cannabis medicines work, list the types of cannabis medicines available and explain the existing evidence for cannabis medicines’ use for specific health conditions and the importance of evidence-informed prescribing. We will be addressing questions throughout the presentation, throughout Jan’s presentation, but we will try and group the questions up so that we are not disturbing her presentation too much. Now I would like to hand over to Jan. Jan: So good evening everyone. It is lovely to see so many people on line. My name is Jan and I am here to hopefully provide some interesting information for you. So going through our presentation tonight, I am going to first of all talk about what makes a medicine a medicine, some of the things we know about cannabis and medicine, and then talk about two of the most important cannabinoids available in medicines in Australia at the moment, and that is Delta 9 THC including some of its uses, and adverse events, and cannabidiol often abbreviated to CBD and how it is being used in some of the adverse events, the available combinations of THC and cannabidiol, and the evidence for use in certain conditions from some of the reviews that The Therapeutics Goods Administration commissioned last year. So, talking about cannabis as a medicine. So, we have got this thing where we regulate therapeutic goods. We know that therapeutics have a known composition. They have got known likely effects and we generally know what their likely side effects are. We have usually got product information and quite a bit of information we can go to, to look up and understand what is going to happen when we use a certain dose on a certain patient. We generally know what the likely activity is in the body so that we know how long it is going to be active for that patient, and we usually know how long it is going to take for that product to leave the body. Now, cannabis is a plant, a fantastically complex plant. There is over 100 cannabinoids which are particular chemicals. We know that when we eat a cannabis plant, we convert some of the non-psychoactive cannabinoids from their acidic form to their active form. We know that there is also potentially other active ingredients in cannabis plants, and we also know that even if we have got exactly a cloned plant, depending on where we plant it, when we harvest it, the amount of light that plant is exposed to, where the product is grown including I think it is latitude, you are going to have a different cannabinoid content from exactly the same clone of a plant. We also know that in Australia, when the police seize cannabis being used illicitly, most of the cannabis being seized in Australia has got really high THC content comparatively and not a lot of the cannabidiol. So, if a patient is using a product that they have grown themselves, from seeds they have obtained in Australia, chances are they are using a high THC low cannabidiol product. So when we look at the black market, products that people are using in Australia, or look at some of the foods that are available overseas and your patients might talk to you about brand names like Elixinol and so on. We know that overseas and in Australia, the cannabis plant is really, really good at cleaning up paddocks. It sucks up heavy metals where people use a lot of pesticides, but also once we have cut the cannabis it is also quite a good medium for fungal growth. And so there is often significant contamination from black market product. When people try and turn black market cannabis into a tincture, there are lots of different ways, you only have to google on YouTube and you can find ten different ways to make yourself a cannabis medicine if you are so inclined. But that means that we have got no standardisation of the end product, so a person might say “well I had a gram of cannabis that I did something with”, how much active THC they have got at the end of that process is going to vary significantly. So, people get different doses with each batch they make. Overseas, people in some countries in Europe have cannabinoids available in their food products and we know that some of the companies that do food testing and are trying to market their products as you know, just about medicine therapeutics. Even their own testing by those companies show that there is significant batch to batch variability in the cannabinoid content. The US food and Drug Administration has done some testing of products being sold in America as foods. Some of them being sold as having high cannabinoid content actually have no cannabinoid content, some of them have very different cannabinoid content to what is on the label, and we know that even some food-grade products in some countries actually do contain THC even though theoretically you would think that they would not, because usually one of the regulations about having a food is that they are THC-free. So when we look at cannabis as a medicine, you know, we have had a history of using cannabis and cannabis extracts as a medicine. And it is quite interesting, even when we look back in history and we look at some of the articles written in the 19th Century about cannabis. The doctors even then were complaining about the batch to batch variability of medicines because they were making it from a plant and at that time they did not have gas chromatography. So, you know, even doctors for 200 to 300 years have been using it as a medicine, but even so it has been difficult to get a standardised product. Towards the end of the late 19th Century, people who were concerned about the intoxicant qualities of cannabis started to see the medicines being moved into poison schedules. So Western Australia had cannabis or Indian hemp put into its poison schedule in 1899 for example, and we have seen increased regulation as people more are concerned about the intoxicant effect rather than their availability as a clinical tool. However, in Israel there was continued research throughout the 20th Century, and that led to us being able to recognise some of the endogenous compounds that our own bodies produce, and that gives us a clue as to how some of these cannabis medicines may actually work in us, on us. So, we get to the endocannabinoid system and this is a busy slide and I am really sorry about that. But basically, the really exciting thing about cannabinoids are they work all over our bodies. But it depends on the dose. It depends on the person’s particular metabolism as to what effect that they are actually going to have. But, you have got two major ones that people talk about, which is anandamide and 2-AG, and basically they can really affect how your neurotransmitters work. They moderate things like your cyclooxygenase system. They can have immunomodulatory effects. They can help with inflammation because they work on your cyclooxygenase. They can help stimulate appetite. They have things to do with your homeostasis so there is interest in them as you know, potential medicines for diabetes. There is a whole lot of really, really interesting things that these molecules do, but we are still at the very infancy of really understanding how they do this in a standardised fashion. Harry: And so the cannabinoids that attach themselves at different affinities to the different receptors. Jan: Yes. So for example, THC binds to your CB1 and your CB2 receptors, whereas cannabidiol tends to block uptake at your CB1 and CB2 receptors and tends to moderate things through other channels. I really encourage people who are particularly interested in the pharmacology of them to do more reading of it, because it is really complex and a lot of it is still, you know as I say, it gets published every day, something new that we have discovered works in a you, know, a rat model of a disease, works in a, how we understand receptors. So it is complex, it is not simple and however, like a lot of things in medicine, just the same as most of us cannot explain exactly how paracetamol works, we tend to be able to move on. So, we do have registered medicines. So, we do have one registered medicine in Australia which is nabiximols, which is a 1:1 ratio of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol. Its trade name is Sativex. It is on the Australian register of therapeutic goods. It is marketed here in Australia. It is not available on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Its registered indication is spasticity and multiple sclerosis and a lot of the evidence that we will talk about later has actually been generated from clinical trials using this particular drug. Overseas there are medicines registered, dronabinol and nabilone, THC only products. And just recently there has been a recommendation to the FDA that cannabidiol in sesame oil product manufactured by a pharmaceutical company that has been in clinical trials and has been used here in New South Wales for paediatric epilepsy, has been recommended for registration but is not registered yet. So we have imported cannabis medicines. So, unlike a lot of other drugs where when they are unregistered in Australia, usually they are imported on a case by case basis, the Commonwealth Government has decided to allow shipments of cannabis medicines into Australia. So we have no home-grown products as of yet. They are largely coming from Canada where they are being held to good manufacturing standards, so there are two standards that have to happen. One is a good agricultural practice standard which is about growing things that are not contaminated with heavy metals and pesticides. And the next one is a good manufacturing practice standard which is about making things to pharmaceutical quality so that you have got some consistency between your products. So if your patient gets prescribed a medicines, then you know, for every batch of that medicine, you should be expecting the same sort of effects and side effects, unlike some of the black market and artisanal products that people are using at the moment. However, we do not have a lot of phase one data. So there is not a lot of safety data for some of these products. But also, we do not know, you know, in hundreds of healthy people how a lot of these products are absorbed and we do know that they are variably absorbed. Some people are really good at metabolising cannabinoids, some people are slow metabolisers. We do not know all the metabolism because we know that for example depending on what carrier oil a cannabinoid is in, they will be absorbed and metabolised at different rates, and again they get excreted at different rates. The really important thing is to understand it that whilst they are used a lot in Canada, they have not actually been tested for safety or efficacy and we do know however, that some of these products if you are trying to look for which one of these might I look for, some of the products are used in clinical trials in Australia and overseas, so at least they have gone through a human research ethics committee scrutiny before they start being used, and so that gives you some hope that they have got, you know, at least had something go over them with a ruler. Harry: Do we have any idea how long it will be before there is an Australian product? Jan: Look, they are in development at the moment and you will probably read it in the share market reports before you read it in the medical reports to be honest, and that is how we are finding a lot of information about the cannabis industry in Australia. So, one of the things that we often hear about is how much the imported cannabis medicines cost. Unlike a lot of other medicines where you are paying for a lot of the research and development, here a lot of the medicines are actually priced at how much cannabinoid per dose you are getting. So basically, if you have got a 10 mg dose, you are usually paying about 30 cents per mg for THC-containing medicines, so your patient if they are on a 10 mg a day dose, will be paying about three dollars a day. If however they had a THC to CBD medicine where they were using 10 mg a day, it would be about six dollars a day and for cannabidiol only medicines, these are the ones that you are often seeing in the press. Kids using cannabidiol for their epilepsy, are often using 20 mg per kilo, so we wind up it costs them about $120 a day and that is where the real affordability argument comes in. If we look at black market products, in New South Wales, we see hydroponic cannabis costing about $10 to $50 a gram. In Canada, we see patients using about 2 grams daily on average, so that would be about $20 of black market product a day. And I know lots of people can grow their own and do different things, but you are not necessarily doing your patient a favour by sending them down to the pub, because the cost may not be as different as you think. It depends a lot on the dose and we have seen very different doses from what we use in cannabis medicines. Harry: So this is likely to limit its appeal to a lot of people? Jan: Well, I think particularly, well if a patient is really interested in it, if they think it is going to cost so much that they do not want to talk to you about it, if you can actually reassure them that if you are on a lower dose it is possibly not going to cost you that much compared to what the black market is, that is a good conversation to have because the patient at least would be having something that is safe and quality controlled. If it a conversation about a child with paediatric epilepsy, like a lot of the really expensive drugs that are highly specialised drugs, they are usually prescribed in our public hospital system and we have mechanisms to do that, and so that is about sending people to the appropriate, you know, highly specialised centre that deals with high cost drugs all the time. So, we can have a look at some of the components of our cannabis medicines that are available in Australia. So the first cannabinoid I will talk about is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. Now, one of the myths is of course, that medicinal cannabis cannot get you high. But actually, using delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol is actually, it is a very legitimate therapeutic, so trying to say oh you know, medicinal cannabis will not get you high and you should not use this product is probably not a good message, because this is actually a product that is quite well studied. It is responsible for a lot of the psychoactive effects of cannabis. We know that it reduces nausea and vomiting and that is in fact its registered indication in the United States and Canada. Dronabinol is the synthetic THC product, and that is its registered indication. We know that in animal models of pain, it can help reduce pain but that has not necessarily translated through to the human clinical trials. A lot of what I am talking about tonight is if you are a mouse or a rat, cannabis is an excellent drug for what ails you. But unfortunately, like a lot of things that we see working really well in mouse models, when we move it to human translation, it is not always as effective. We think it can improve appetite. We certainly know that, you know, there is the legendary munchies effect, however you know, some clinical trials have shown it to be more equivocal. And the really interesting thing about it is that in some doses it is anticonvulsant and in some doses it is proconvulsant and you sometimes do not know until a person has actually had it. We usually see oral doses starting at about 2.5 mg twice a day and the usual maximum is about 30 mg a day, because after about 30 mg a day, most of the product information from the drugs register overseas, that is when you really start seeing the psychoactive effects well outweigh any clinical benefit from anything else. If we look at the adverse effects of using a THC product. For this slide I have used the product information from one of the registered products overseas. We see asthenia which is a general weakness and malaise. I had to go away and look that one up because it was not a word I use often in my clinical practice or in my public health medicine practice. We do see palpitations, tachycardia, vasodilation and facial flush, none of which would be you know, hugely concerning. Interestingly, paradoxically, it can also cause nausea and vomiting. I am not going to talk about chronic cannabis dependence and some of those other issues that come with cycle vomiting with that. But you know, it can actually contribute to nausea and vomiting. With the CNS it can also cause dizziness, euphoria and of course depending on who you are, that euphoria is either a benefit or a negative. It can cause a paranoid reaction in some people. It causes people to feel sleepy. People find that they have trouble organising their thoughts. Some people feel nervous and anxious when they take it, confused, feeling out of body and hallucinating. So, if you look at the ones with the star, they are not really uncommon, you know if you treat 100 patients, you will have three patients with that as long as you do not go too high with your dosage. When we look at cannabidiol, this is the one that is a particularly interesting molecule. We are still learning how to use it and what the likely side effects are and even what the long term effects are going to be of this. One of the really interesting things about cannabidiol is that it seems to modify some of the psychoactive effects of the THC when it is co-administered. It does not completely ameliorate them though, so we cannot say if give a 1:1 ratio of cannabidiol and THC that somebody will not have a bad psychoactive effect from the THC, but we do have some hope that people will have less problem. We have seen it become a sedative at around 300 mg a day. We do however know and this is really important when people are prescribing it, that it is a potent inhibitor of lots of enzymes in the people, so any of those drugs that are completely notorious for it, welcome to cannabidiol it will have a nice interaction with them. In refractory paediatric epilepsy syndromes, they are using quite large doses, around 15-20 mg per kg a day. We actually do not have a lot of evidence, so some of the preparations that you will see imported say have a 50 mg capsule. Now, we do not have a lot of evidence for cannabidiol alone having a particular clinical effect at low doses. There is lots of theoretical things it might do. It seems to be an antioxidant. It seems to be an anti-inflammatory. It seems to be neuroprotective. It some of its immunomodulatory effects one of the interesting things is you know, are we getting some of the effects of cannabidiol in paediatric epilepsy because you know, they respond to prednisone, is it the immunomodulation of the cannabidiol that is actually helping to control some of those seizure disorders in those kiddies. So it is not however, completely side effect free. When we look at the results from the clinical trials for paediatric epilepsy, we can see that they are documenting common adverse effects, and they include the kids getting diarrhoea, they become sleepy. Some of them can run an unexpected temperature for no good reason. Their appetite can be decreased which you know, you can understand if it is opposing some of the effects of THC. THC stimulates appetite. Cannabidiol opposing those effects may decrease the appetite. Some of the kids vomit and what we do see in paediatric epilepsy, is we are seeing really high levels of some of the anti-epileptics. And so they are getting high levels of rufinamide, piramate, clobazam, and so then when you have a look at other drugs that your patients might be using, for example, warfarin, metoprolol, amitriptyline, paroxetine, some NSAIDs, you might find that they get increase serum levels. So it is really important that if for whatever reason a patient is doing something with a cannabinoid, that you have got an open and honest relationship with them because otherwise if suddenly they are having postural hypertension and really sleepy, it might be their amitriptyline that they are also on for their pain, rather than the cannabinoid itself. It is not the cannabinoids doing it, it might be their drug interactions. So it might be about if they are getting a benefit from the cannabinoid, dropping back on some of their other medications. Harry: So we have had two questions. The first question is, what are the effects of the cannabinoids and alcohol, and secondly, can you drive while you are taking them? Jan: Okay. So we tend to see an additive effect of cannabinoids and alcohol as far as adverse events go. So they tend to potentiate the intoxicating effect of THC. It has not had a lot of studies that I am aware of, cannabidiol and alcohol, so I cannot comment on that, because believe it or not, people with paediatric epilepsy are not heavy drinkers largely. So that is where most of the clinical trial data has come from, and there has not been a lot of systematic collection of adverse event data and drug interactions with alcohol and cannabidiol because the number of adults who are taking cannabidiol alone are small in the reported literature. As far as the THC, alcohol certainly potentiates the intoxicating effects of THC. Now with driving. With driving, we put together an expert panel in New South Wales to talk about driving, because is there a safe time to drive, how long to drive after. And unlike alcohol, where we see a fairly linear response between blood alcohol goes up, impairment goes up, cannabinoids are really interesting. Some people have significant impairment at a certain blood level. Other people have got zero impairment. People who have got heavy use will have cannabinoids washing around their system for longer times than people who are using low doses. So the answer is, we have no safe answer. What we do know, is that there are good driving studies with people using THC which says that they have trouble staying in their lane because they get this inattention thing happening. We do know that generally it is an intoxicant so people’s judgement about making decisions about “oh, so I have got to do something right now” are there. So we also know that authorities overseas, so Canada says if you are on a THC product, do not drive. Israel says if you are on a THC product, do not drive. The product information for Sativex says, if you have spasms from multiple sclerosis and you are using Sativex, you probably should not be driving. So, our advice that we were given at the Ministry of Health from our expert group was generally people will be impaired and as such they probably should not be driving. And it is also not a defence under the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act to have had a cannabinoid prescribed to say that you can, you know, “I have been prescribed this, I am right to drive.” It is not a defence under that Act. And at the moment, we do not have the collective evidence to be able to go to our colleagues in justice and say we need an exemption for this group of people, because one of the levels of impairment which I think is like five nanograms per mil in blood of THC, also crosses the therapeutic boundary of what you actually want somebody to be achieving for some of the therapeutic effects. So, by definition, if you have got a therapeutic effect of the drug for some people, you also have impairment. So, we are not at the stage where we can go to our colleagues and make a clear case for why it should not be an offence to drive with THC in your system. Harry: So currently in New South Wales, do not drive. Jan: Do not drive. Harry: If you get picked up you are in trouble. Jan: Yes. And if you ask me how long after a patient has been administered THC, can they drive for, at the moment the advice from the guys who are doing the chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting trial, so those patients are only having it for a very limited time because they are only going to be feeling sick from the chemotherapy for a window of time, I think they are sort for saying 48 to 72 hours. But that again is assuming those patients are not regular users of cannabis. They are de novo. But it is not 12 hours like you might see on the RTA website. They are being quite conservative with their advice to their patients, and for a patient being administered it every day, we do not have a safe level to say yes, you can drive. Harry: And that is because THC has got quite a long half-life, does it not? Jan: Absolutely. And it is variable. And, the saliva test does only test for THC. It is not testing for metabolites, but to get a blood level going and keep it going, particularly for an oral product, you are probably going to cross that impairment boundary. So that is the really hard part. It is a bit like you know, you are assessing all your patients that you are prescribing potentially sedating medications for, and again, if you have got a patient that has got such a severe condition that they might need the THC, that condition in itself might be an impairment that suggests that they should not be driving. Yes, so again, it is about assessing your patient with the impairment and so, if they have got a general impairment that you are treating, really have a consideration about what am I treating? Has this person got such terrible pain that they are distracted anyway, that they probably should not be driving. Has the person got epilepsy that they probably should not be driving? Cannabidiol in and of itself, will not get picked up on a saliva test, but because of all those drug-drug interactions and the fact that it is usually being used for refractory epilepsy, the person probably should not be driving. So, the last drug I am going to be talking about is nabiximols and that is that registered product, Sativex. It is registered in Australia for MS spasticity. Per spray, there is 2.7 mg of THC and 2.5 mg of cannabidiol per spray. You will notice that I am not abbreviating my cannabinoids to CBD and so on that you might have heard in some other presentations, and that is because we are trying to encourage good prescribing practice, because what we see is people either not being familiar with the abbreviations and trying to prescribe a cannabinoid that is actually not commercially available because they have got mixed up. One of the classic sayings is that it is cannabinoid scrabble, you know CDN, CBG, CBD and so on. So we are really encouraging doctors when they are prescribing it, THC is a fairly well known abbreviation for delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol but we would really encourage people as more cannabinoids become commercially available, please spell out your cannabinoids when you are writing a prescription. This one is administered as an oro-mucosal spray. You do not need to go to the TGA to get off-label use approval, just like you do not need to go to TGA to be able to prescribe amitriptyline off-label for example. It does need State authorisation, as it is a controlled drug and it has been investigated for use in chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting where it was promising, that study had 16 patients in it. There have been huge studies done for it in chronic cancer pain and across the different studies it was a non-significant improvement in pain. So there was a tendency towards an improvement but it was not significant and whether it was clinically significant is something else to debate. But what they do seem to see is an improvement in quality of life in these chronic cancer pain patients, which if you are thinking about what are you really after in a person that you are looking after in palliative care, that is important. There has been a small pilot study in rheumatoid arthritis and that has tended towards disease severity improvement and pain improvement, but it does not suggest that tomorrow everyone with rheumatoid arthritis should be prescribed nabiximols. And there have also been recent clinical trials in New South Wales around mitigating cannabis withdrawal syndromes, so it has got a really interesting role perhaps in mitigating cannabis withdrawal syndrome and I think overseas it has been investigated with some of the narcotic withdrawal syndromes. So I have just mentioned some of the other cannabinoids, and as I said at the beginning, there is over 100 cannabinoids in the cannabis plant, and they are really interesting. The really important thing to understand is, by the time they are usually in a medicine, they are in a very different concentration to what you would normally see in a cannabis plant and that is because usually they are extracted and refined and then put back into some sort of medicine so that we get that standardised cannabinoid ratio. So we are starting to see people being exposed to much larger doses of cannabinoids than they would have had through normal mechanisms. Currently they are not commercially available in Australia. There is this idea of the entourage effect where it is the combination of cannabinoids and other phytochemicals that are available in cannabis that work together to give its clinical effects. It has been difficult to quantify because of that idea that you know, different plants will have different things, so how much of the entourage effect is important. And also, it is really hard to quantify because a lot of the chemicals are not unique to cannabis. They are found in rosemary. They are found in lemons. They are found in other things that we eat, so how much of it is because it was present in the plant and how much was different. And again, these other turpenoids, limonene, all of these are very different proportions in different products. There are very few studies examining the differences between plant derived cannabis medicines and synthetic cannabis medicines. It is usually synthetic cannabis medicine or comparator or plant derived cannabis medicine or comparator. People are starting to do more studies looking at you know, if we have plant-derived full spectrum extract type thing where you have got trace cannabinoids in it versus pure, but they are not mature. Everything available in Australia is pretty much plant-derived. Nabiximols is plant-derived. It has got trace other cannabinoids in it. All the goods coming in under TGO 93 have trace cannabinoids in everything else. So there are traces of other things in all of these drugs. So, when we talk around where are we seeing the real interest at the moment. On my list here is not paediatric epilepsy and we will certainly talk about epilepsy, but one of the things is with paediatric epilepsy, is it is being used in really refractory kids. And so generally, our advice would be just like any other significantly refractory condition, you probably do not want to take responsibility for prescribing an experimental drug to a patient with really refractory disease unless you are working with the specialists in that particular symptom or disease and that is just for everybody. We do not expect an adult gastroenterologist to be prescribing for a pain medicine problem. We do not expect an intensivist to be prescribing for anorexia. We just expect people to be thinking really carefully about what they are doing and what is in my normal scope of practice. Where do I work with my colleagues and to try and make sure that the patient has got coordinated care so that we do not wind up with this problem of either a doctor feeling compelled to prescribe and they are not comfortable to do it without support from their colleagues, or a patient sort of being led up the garden path a little bit I think with an idea that something might help when it might not. So, the TGA guidance documents - so as I said earlier, the Therapeutic Goods Administration along with a whole lot of groups - they involved RACGP as well as consumer groups, as well as groups with special interests in the various conditions, to develop some guidance for the use of cannabis medicines. What it really is, is an evidence review. It does not help you a lot if you want to know what dose I should use or what medicine for what condition. But it does give you a broad understanding of what is the state of the evidence of systematic reviews for the common conditions that people are interested in prescribing for. So, one of the big conditions of course is palliative care, and the messages that come through is that it is adjunctive to standard palliative care management. You do not abandon your normal tools for looking after your palliative care patients to use a cannabis medicine. You think about where could this cannabis medicine fit? What symptom am I trying to target? And then you chose your cannabis medicine for that. It is really probably not going to modify the course of a patient’s disease, although sometimes you know, patients feel that it has made a huge difference to their quality of life and so they feel like things have happened. And one of the things that is really difficult in this space, is when we do the clinical trials, such as the one I talked about, there is large, large clinical trials for the Sativex for chronic cancer pain, we get “it might help a bit”, is really different to patient’s personal stories about you know, “I took it and it was the best thing,” “I could sleep for the first time,” “I felt so much better.” So we are still trying to understand what it is that the patients are responding to. Is it the placebo effect where you know, the harder it is to get access to a treatment, the more likely we are to feel that it works? Is it the fact that you had that dissociative experience where the pain is still there but actually doc, I do not care about it? That is what one of my palliative care colleagues has said when she talked to her patients using it. You know, the pain is still there, but I just do not care about it when I am taking cannabis. Which you know, is a relief for that patient. And so what we often found when we were trying to work out what to do with the clinical trials, was that the studies were often missing the primary endpoints, but sort of consistently what was being found was this improved quality of life and they seemed to be fairly well tolerated. So we have got this clinical trial underway in New South Wales looking at appetite stimulation and there will be a new trial announced soon that is just about trying to pitch some of that quality of life thing and it is more of an access trial that will be available to patients across New South Wales. We are running that with the new Cannabis Research Institute up in Newcastle and they have got a number of GPs, palliative care providers, so that we are trying to design that trial so it is accessible as possible and there will be more information about that once we have got that all solidified and the ethics committee has approved it and all those things. Harry: And these guidelines are very easily found if you just google the title. Jan: Yes, they are. Absolutely. So what did they find when they actually looked at it? And this is this problem that I am talking about where there was no differences between cannabinoids and placebo for improving caloric intakes. So we would really expect that to have worked. You know, everyone knows somebody who did something at uni and got the munchies. But when we see it in clinical trials, we are not seeing it. We are not seeing that huge improvement in appetite. We are not seeing a huge difference in nausea and vomiting. We are not seeing a big difference in pain. We might, you know, we are seeing a trend towards it helping, but we are not seeing a statistically significant effect. But we do know it is fairly well tolerated and we are not seeing a huge number of adverse events. So if it is something that you have tried your standard manoeuvres in palliative care and you have got a patient who would like to try it, then perhaps that is what you are taking into account. We have also seen some interest in dementia and it is not helped by the headlines, like “Cannabis will help reverse dementia.” I think a lot of us have got a family member with dementia or know a close friend or, you know it is a very common condition and it is a very distressing condition for family and for patients and for everyone. Unfortunately, we know with dementia that pharmaceutical interventions are not ideal and it is behavioural management and everything, and so we have got to take that all into account before anyone thinks about using a cannabinoid for dementia. There have been two trials done overseas where they looked at the dronabinol which is that synthetic THC product, versus placebo in Alzheimer’s type dementia. In the trials they had small numbers. They had difficulty recruiting to them and that is something we are seeing commonly with cannabis trials. They often fail because people do not want to be recruited into them, either because they are already using something and they do not want to move on to it, or there is a stigma about using cannabis as a medicine. What we see is that for dronabinol, there was some weight gain and using dronabinol we had negative effect decrease in therapy phases and we saw a greater reduction in patients receiving cannabinoids. So it could help, because we know that with dementia, we can see you know, a problem with weight loss and so you know, something that stimulates appetite not necessarily a bad thing, something that might help with anxiety and depression. But again, it is very experimental. We are not going to reverse dementia at the moment, again unless you are a mouse. Really good if you are a mouse. I cannot help wishing I was a mouse. But at the moment, we have not got the evidence in human studies. So, moving on to epilepsy. And so, we have had that historical use of cannabis tincture for seizure control, and to be honest it largely fell out of use because we got better drugs and those better drugs were things like bromide and phenobarbital which most of us would not think of using in a human any more. However, we do know that we have got kids who are still fitting after lots of exposure to lots of different anti-epileptic drugs and so we have got clinical trials currently focussing on higher dose cannabidiol in treatment resistant epilepsy syndromes. If you talk to the paediatric neurologists, they will talk to you about significant drug-drug interactions and the fact that this needs to be monitored really closely. They have seen liver function tests get very, very deranged. We have already talked about the fact that it is already a very high cost thing, and so if you do have paediatric patients who are interested, usually they are refractory, they have failed at least five drug therapies. They are probably under the care of our paediatric neurologist, but all paediatric neurologists in New South Wales are actually authorised prescribers for the cannabidiol and all children who meet those particularly refractory criteria are actually eligible to go into our pool to receive compassionate access and at the moment that is being triaged on clinical necessity by a team of paediatric neurologists who set up that criteria. Harry: And so do they get the cannabinoids through the hospital? Jan: Yes. So they are being supplied directly from the four centres that have got paediatric neurologists operating from them. So, if we do look at epilepsy patients, and of course some of these studies have not just been done in under 18’s, they are actually being done in people to 25 and 30 with some of these complex epilepsy syndromes such as Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndrome. I am not professing to be an expert in any of these particular syndromes, but they are very refractory things. And so, it favours CBD as far as working. It can help in some people achieve a 50% reduction in seizures. But what we do not have is the evidence that you would sort of see in the media, where you would expect that every child being administered CBD would suddenly stop fitting for life. We also do not have a lot of evidence that it is useful as a rescue medication, so again you will see some of the parents in the media sort of, you know, putting out a dab of cannabis and rubbing it in the cheek. There is not a lot of evidence that it actually works as a rescue medication and I would probably prefer any relative of mine to be given an urgent benzodiazepine. I think that is still the treatment of choice, rather than have cannabis rubbed in their cheek. But it is an interesting drug. There are other cannabinoids that are being investigated for anti-epileptic effects, but we are not there yet. Now, here we are moving onto chronic pain and this is the really challenging area I think for everybody, because again, we have got a cluster of symptoms that at this point we know drugs are not the answer for, but at the end of the day, drugs are sometimes the only answer we have got. We have got this problem of a lot of anecdote in the community about how it will really change somebodies pain and what we really want to do is help people understand where the actual evidence is on chronic pain. And again, it is being studied in clinical trials, some of which are quite large. But the real thing to emphasise here again is that drugs are not the core component of therapy. Patient education is really important particularly when they are expecting that the drug is going to do wonders for them, and the real take home is that there is this need for larger trials of sufficient quality, size and duration to help us understand what role if any, the cannabinoids have in chronic pain. So when we look at these in clinical trials, the review evidence suggested that to actually get an outcome we are going to have to treat somewhere between 22 and 26 generic chronic pain patients to get one to have some benefit. So we have a look at our therapeutic guidelines for analgesia they will usually say around an NNT of about 7-8 is where we want to be at for chronic pain. So we normally would not pick up our prescription pads for this drug. We also know from other studies, it is not in this guidance, but it has been discussed by the authors of the guidance, that the number needed to harm if we can get that at about 7-9. So we have got a terrible number needed to treat to number needed to harm ratio. We do see with people with MS related neuropathic pain that they seem to get a better effect from it. We see a non-statistically significant increase in the proportion of pain who achieve a 30% reduction in pain intensity, and for non-MS related neuropathic pain, we see a 50% reduction in pain and reduction pain scores compared with patients taking a placebo. But when we show these to our colleagues in our Faculty of Pain Medicine, they are not very excited about this. And one of the things they are concerned about is, at the moment, a lot of people do actually self-medicate with chronic pain and if we look at a study that is taking place in Australia at the moment, and has been published. It is called the POINT study, and this is actually looking at people who are using pharmaceutical opiates. And what is happening, they have gone and had a look at these people, so it is over 1,500 people who have been prescribed opiates for chronic non-cancer pain. And so they had a look on cannabis use, the cannabis use disorder that could be diagnosed and cannabis used for pain. So out of those 1,500 people, 16% had used cannabis for pain relief, including 6% in the past month. 25% reported that they would use it for pain relief if they had had access, and the really interesting thing is, it is a younger group who report a greater pain severity, they get a greater interference from it, they do not cope with their pain as well, they have more days out of role in the past year. And that is actually something that we are seeing reflected in Canada as well. They looked at 1,000 people coming through the doors of one of their large rheumatology clinics and looked at who was using cannabis for medical purposes as they have it in Canada, versus their other people, and again, they were younger, they were poorer, they had less coping with similar objective measurements of disease. And so one of the questions is, are we actually seeing cannabis use because people are having trouble negotiating a potentially expensive and difficult to navigate healthcare system, and so people feel that by self-medicating, they are actually doing themselves some good. But having said that, we do not usually recommend that people go home and drink alcohol for their pain, either. So, we do know that it is being used for pain relief in Australia at the moment with a lot of people self-medicating. So it is a difficult question for GPS, because one of the questions is, “Well if my patient is self-medicating, would it not be better to put them on a legal standardised product?” But the problem is, we still do not know whether that is an appropriate thing to do. We do not know if that is going to stop them using other cannabis sources. We do not know what to prescribe them. There is a whole lot of thorns in that particular argument that we have not quite got to the end of that discussion. So I think it is you know, it is not an unreasonable question, am I doing a harm minimisation gesture, but the problem is, we may actually just be prolonging somebodies difficulty with rehabilitating from their chronic pain syndrome. So it is a difficult thing. Harry: And they are much more likely to be driving. Jan: And they are much more likely to be driving. And so there are all those harms coming into contact with the criminal justice system or losing your licence and all of those things. So we are better off possibly recommending other therapies as best we can. For multiple sclerosis’s best studies we have got a registered medicine and this is what people are using for other cannabinoids or complexes we have got limitations because we do not have quality evidence for those other cannabinoids being used. We do not have a lot of evidence around disease activity or disability progression, although there is some theoretical immunomodulatory effect and some of the large registry studies overseas are starting to monitor for are we getting better outcomes for people if they are using baclofen versus nabiximols. But we do not actually, also one of the problems is, often it is not baclofen plus nabiximols versus baclofen. It is often nabiximols versus nothing. So we actually do not know how well nabiximols goes against for example against some of our current standard treatment, so that makes it complex as well. When we talk about chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, the general guidance from the document is high THC medicinal cannabis products can sometimes be effective for nausea and vomiting but we have had a lot of revolutionary treatments since the clinical trials were being done using dronabinol. And you know, they include, you know the advent 5HT3 antagonists and there are newer things like NK1 aprepitant and so on, those ones. And even more recently, olanzapine has been shown in a large RCT to have a significant impact in chemo-induced nausea and vomiting. And so, we are actually having trouble recruiting patients into our CINV trial, because actually we are doing a much better job of controlling chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting even than what we were doing three years ago, which is really, you know, such a change because there are some people who do not tolerate the 5HT, that cannot tolerate the old drugs, like you know they get the terrible dystonias and the akathisias. So you know, there are a group of people who actually are a bit stranded for anti-emetic therapy. But for general nausea and vomiting, generally you have got to be really careful before you would start recommending a cannabinoid. But for chemo-induced nausea and vomiting, we have actually got a clinical trial available in a lot of our centres at the moment. It is using a THC and cannabidiol capsule that is being manufactured by one of those Canadian companies who have got GMP certification. It is at all of these centres around New South Wales and so if you do have a patient that is particularly interested, it is probably worth talking to them about getting involved in the clinical trial. The trial methodology is that they are exposed to cannabinoid or placebo in cycle 1, and then switch, and then choice of therapy for cycle 3. So everyone gets a cannabinoid at some point, and then it is unmasked at the end and if the patient has actually responded to the cannabinoid, they are then eligible for ongoing treatment with those cannabinoids. So in helping us generate the evidence which is what we really want to do, we want to see what place these have in therapy, so that as doctors when we are actually asked to pick up a pen and prescribe, what do we do? So moving on to what they are doing in Canada. So, Canada is often held up as the model for care. One of the things to recognise in Canada, is that in Canada doctors actually do not prescribe cannabis medicines. They can make a recommendation that a patient can access cannabis, but as part of that recommendation, they do not actually specify which cannabinoids are being used, and the patient can take that recommendation for 1 gram of cannabis per day for example, and take it to the local dispensary where the cannabis guru there will inform them what will work for them best. So the doctor does not have a lot of control over what their patient actually receives. So it is a very different system of accessing cannabis and in fact the Canadian, I think it is the Society of Physicians and Surgeons in Canada, have said now that we are going to decriminalise cannabis, we want that whole regime gone. But there is a different argument for a different day. So basically though, what they have done in Canada is where the physicians have been, particularly family physicians are being asked, this is the flow chart that the family physicians in Canada have suggested that people have a look at. And this is trying to put things into perspective as to what a general practitioner, a family physician might actually want to do. And so they are basically saying, is it for neuropathic pain, palliative pain, CINV or spasticity or spinal cord spasticity, because you know if you have got spasticity from one neurological disease, you are probably going to get similar effects for a different neurological disease with the same outcome of spasticity. Let’s not get too precious. If it is not for those things, as a family physician, you would recommend against use. Now that is not saying a specialist, one of the things they discuss in this article that I have listed there, and it is freely available, you do not have to be a subscriber, is you know, why as a family physician you might not want to be prescribing for refractory paediatric epilepsy for example. So that is why it is not addressed in this flow chart. These are things they say, you know as a GP, as a family physician you may be confronted with. And so, you know, they are sort of talking about for people with neuropathic pain have you done more than three medications? Have you done more than three standard interventions for that patient? For the palliative pain, have they had two different interventions? Because you know, lower standard different pain mechanisms again for all the different ways people get pain and discomfort from cancer. And again, are they refractory to standard therapies for these things? Then maybe try one of the medical cannabinoids as an adjunctive therapy. And so in Australia we have got more control over the cannabinoids that we use here. We do not have dronabinol for example available here, but we do have TGO 93 regulated THC products. They generally say do not let your patient go off and do it themselves, because particularly smoke, because of the high risk of bias in available studies and we still do not know what is going to happen if people are exposed, a lot of these at much higher doses than we are used to. But always talk to your patient. That is the really important thing about not shutting down the conversation. It is about talking it through with your patient. One of the questions I have just seen coming up was, can we monitor blood levels, and the answer is we have just resourced the University of Newcastle Centre to actually do some of that work with us and that is around being able to get some blood levels, so that if a person has started at what they thought was a low dose of THC and the patient has a very abnormal reaction, such as seeing fairies or fitting or doing something really abnormal and you want to know what has happened, I understand that if you get a serum tube collected and send it to John Hunter Hospital, you know, you can request your normal pathology collected divert it to John Hunter Hospital to ACRE for cannabinoid studies, that can be done. But as I say, we still do not understand a lot about what a blood level versus a symptom means. But it certainly can be done, but it is not routinely done at the moment. But considering how little we know about how these medicines are absorbed and how they are acting and at what doses they are acting, and at what blood levels they are acting, we are certainly encouraging as part of that big palliative care study I was talking about, you know, we are sort of saying 24 hours after studying we would like to get a tube of blood out of everyone please, so we can see how very different people are. Look, we have also got a laundry list of things that people are also interested in and that you will see in the media as something that it is really important that we have access to cannabis medicines to be able to fix. So PTSD is a big one. We have seen, the things that I am showing here are things that people have studied. We have seen studies for THC, THC cannabidiol and nabilone. In the RCT using nabilone we saw some decrease in nightmares for PTSD but there was a high risk of bias. One of the hard parts about doing research with cannabis medicines is that people usually know when they have got THC on board. I am sure that will come as a surprise to everyone, but it is really, really hard to blind people to whether they received THC or not, because a lot of people do actually get those side effects, well side effects or effects again depending on your personal predilection. For anxiety, people are interested in studying cannabidiol and nabilone. Basically at the moment, we are seeing a person given a single dose of cannabidiol and seeing whether they can be made as anxious as when they have not. We have not got long term exposure to cannabidiol for anxiety. For depression, we have not got much human evidence. For Tourette’s, we have seen some case reports in the literature. There has been use of THC which has seen some tic reduction, again uncontrolled studies, high risk of bias. For Parkinson’s disease, there is a lot of interest and anyone who has watched YouTube would think that it was going to fix tremor and fix micrographia and fix everything. There might be some improvement with dyskinesia with cannabidiol, but we do not have really good hang your hat on it evidence yet. For Huntington’s disease, there was some small benefit from nabilone. People using cannabidiol and nabiximols probably did not see an effect. For psychosis, people have used cannabidiol and we are likely to see in the future much, much better studies around schizophrenia and psychosis because cannabidiol seems to be a really interesting anti-psychotic but we are not there yet. We have got to use our standard treatments at the moment. Moving on to the slightly more – curing cancer. Anyone who wants to google “Can cannabis cure cancer” they will find out that the answer is of course it can. There are thousands of studies, where is the government deliberately hiding the cure for cancer because we are in bed with big pharma. And I only wish that was true, but unfortunately, we seem to be, there are some really interesting results of cannabinoids, because they can promote angiogenesis, they can inhibit and promote mitosis and some of them are likely to be pro-mutagenic and some of them are likely to be anti-mutagenic, and as I have said to a number of disappointed people I can cure cancer in a petri dish. It just involves bleach and I am sure you would not like to me to advise you to drink bleach. So we just do not know. What is really interesting though, is that they did some interesting mouse models using cannabidiol in a model of glioblastoma multiform, and what they found was if they gave the mouse just cannabidiol it did not work. If they gave it temozolomide it kind of worked, and when they gave it cannabidiol and the temozolomide together, the effect was much better. So they have moved that on into a human study, which for glioblastoma multiform, it might work synergistically with temozolomide. But it is not like we have got live studies with lots of evidence. And then we wind up with all those problems of it is a rare disease, how do we generate good evidence in rare diseases, which I am sure we can all have a good conversation about another day. This is something that parents are often really interested in and there is a study underway in Israel, but it is certainly too early to be encouraging people to be taking it up as a medication. One of the things that you know, is potentially as I said, cannabidiol can be a sedative, so if you have got a disruptive small child that you give a large dose of sedative too, they become a less disruptive small child, and so we do not know how much of it is that and how much is actual behavioural modification. So that means the same in ADHD they tried using nabiximols and we had a non-significant trend to improvement in symptoms. So they are really interesting things, but we are not there yet. Inflammatory bowel disease is one of the really interesting areas, where Israel did a randomised control trial and they have also done, they did a big retrospective trial of people smoking a particular blend of cannabidiol and THC and then they sort of said, well that is actually probably not how we are going to be delivering this treatment to people with inflammatory bowel disease in the future, so we do need to do randomised control trials and so I think there is that underway in Israel and there is certainly a lot of interest in it, because it is a really disabling thing and you will have seen it in the media here with families who are using it. Fibromyalgia. One of the things that people are suggesting is that fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome and any other disease that we are not particularly good at characterising the pathophysiology of, are of course because of an endocannabinoid deficiency. So how do you fix that? You give somebody cannabinoid. So there is a lot of interest in the people that we have trouble giving a diagnosis to. People who are feeling abandoned. People who a doctor has said to there is nothing more I can do. And they are searching for something, and here we have got this really interesting group of molecules that can do really interesting things and who can blame the patient for wanting to hang their hat on that. I mean, it is a really normal, human reaction, especially if we as doctors do not have much more to add. But for fibromyalgia they have looked at THC. The TGA guidance suggests it is not robust enough for comment. There has been a study looking at dronabinol which is that synthetic THC versus amitriptyline. It was as good as amitriptyline. We know a lot more about amitriptyline and it is very easily available, so if you were going to treat it, I would not suggest that we went straight to THC. But again, you know, some people do not tolerate things, so. Harry: So Jan, just a few questions. Jan: Absolutely. Harry: So one of the questions was, can you become addicted to the medicinal cannabinoids? Jan: So, as far as THC goes, we know that with long term use, about 10% of people will develop some form of dependence. As far as if you stop it abruptly, do you have those physiological problems? People might not feel great, but it is not like it is highly dangerous to stop suddenly. Harry: And one of the other questions is, if someone is pre-disposed to psychotic problems, should they be getting cannabinoids? Jan: Well, they should not be getting THC, that much is certain. So basically there is a number of contraindications to any of these medications, and they are the standard. For THC in particular, personal history of psychosis, personal history of intolerance of the drug. We would even go as far as to say family history of psychosis, so if you have got a strong family history of schizophrenia because there is some genetic component to it, we would probably say do not go mucking around with THC if you can help it. We would also suggest for developing brains, probably not for under 25’s preferentially. Now there is debate you know about that, but generally developing brain plus psychoactive substance is not our best thing to do. So it is usually recognised as contraindication. Now as I mentioned, cannabidiol is actually being explored for its anti-psychotic effects, so it may be that in 10 years’ time, we will have a very different conversation about the place of cannabinoids in psychiatric disease, but I reckon we will be having that conversation in increments over the next 10 years. Harry: So Jan, can you whet our appetite for the second part of this presentation please? Jan: So look, what I think we have talked about tonight is the evidence and one of the questions is, why is New South Wales Health investing so much time in an area for which we have got such equivocal evidence? Why is the government going out and spending all this time, almost promoting the use of these medicines? And I think what we are really interested in doing with this is trying to help GPs have really good conversations with their patients about these, because I think it is one of these things, that if we do not engage, patients will go away and try to manage it themselves, and so I think that is really important. And so in our next one, we will be talking about the prescribing processes, we will be talking about some of the reasons why the controlled drugs are controlled drugs. I know that everyone usually knows it, but we have had this really interesting constellation with the cannabinoids, because we know general practice use of special access scheme and authorised prescriber is pretty rare. There might have been some use of authorised prescriber early on in the piece for some of the medical abortion type drugs, but it has not been a common thing in general practice to use unregistered medicines, and that is because usually we would like to have a lot of information before we do use medicines. And again, the use of the highly controlled drugs like the psychostimulants are again usually the province of paediatricians or psychiatrists or respiratory physicians, not something that GPs have often had to fill out forms with. So if we can help navigate the processes, that is something that will be very helpful in the future, you know, in the times when you do have the patient, that I know what the evidence is, I know how much information I have got and on the balance I think this would be a good thing to do, what do I do next? And so one of the things that we can do in the meantime between now and the next webinar, is we have invested money in putting together a cannabis medicines advisory service. It is available 9-5 Monday to Friday. They are there to help. You want to know what the evidence is for use in a condition? They can help you with it. If it is a weird and wonderful that the TGA have not done, they can go away and do a literature search and come back to you with it. They can tell you about the different cannabinoids that are available. They can help you with the paperwork. They can tell you which form you are going to need to fill in. So I would really encourage people if they have got questions or are super excited between now and the next couple of weeks, this is what I suggest is your first stop. Call the service. They are there to help. We have got drug information and pharmacists there and we have got a clinical pharmacologist there. So they are there. They are experts in medicines and they are there to help and they can also tap into that huge network. And they are located in Newcastle and Hunter New England, so they understand the issues that we are all GPS, and also have an accessing specialist services. So that it what we are there for. Harry: I would like to just quickly go over what our learning outcomes were. I would like to hope that we have been able to demonstrate the difference between medicinal cannabis and illicit or black market cannabis. We have briefly spoken about how cannabis works in our body. We have looked at the cannabis medicines that are available at the moment in Australia, and we have also looked at a range of the existing evidence for where cannabinoids may be useful. Part of this discussion tonight is to help us as GPs to have these discussions with our patients. Whether we like it or not, there will be more patients coming to see us and asking about whether or not this is something that will be useful for them. So once again, thank you very much for your attention tonight. Sammi: That is great. Thank you Harry and Jan for joining us tonight and presenting this webinar. Thank you again everyone for joining us tonight and enjoy the rest of your evening.","May 16, 2018 ...

The RACGP would first like to clarify and highlight that there are significant differences between the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes and recreational purposes. Any attempts to legalise the use of recreational cannabis should not and must not be confused with the use of medicinal cannabis in certain patients under strictly controlled circumstances.  The RACGP’s position statements on the Medicinal use of cannabis products and 
Regulatory 
framework for medicinal use of cannabis products  are available on the RACGP website for your 
consideration. 
 It is also important to recognise the negative health aspects of cannabis when used recreationally, including the risk of mental health problems and cannabis use disorder. Legalising the recreational use of cannabis can also have a significant negative impact on public safety issues, especially driver impairment and work safety problems. These risks have to be carefully considered against the potential benefits that regulating the sale of the cannabis  might bring. On balance, the RACGP cautions against the legalisation of recreational cannabis as this will most likely  encourage use of a drug that will result in increased demands on the Australian healthcare system.   We look forward to hearing about this Inquiry’s progress and outcomes.   Yours sincerely    Dr Charlotte Hespe Vice President

PEP Specialist Stream Reflective Task Example 1   
PEP Specialist Stream – Reflective Task Example 1: 
The PEP program has helped me with learning how to be a general practitioner in Australia from a clinical, administrative, and cultural point of view. The resources provided are very helpful to address the differences from where I practiced previously (New  Zealand) and to consolidate all the information required to manage daily practice.  The general practice I have been working in is in  a small rural town called Nanango (Modified Monash Model score of 5 for remoteness). There is a higher proportion of geri atric and unemployed population in this practice. Compared with my previous practice, my current practice case -mix involves more emergency care such as accident and injuries, procedural work such as skin cancer excisions, and requires more engagement in im proving patient’s health literacy and managing chronic and complex medical conditions. Working in a rural country general practice in Australia has exposed me to a vast mix of clinical presentations. Of note are the zoonotic diseases such as Ross River, Q fever and Japanese Encephalitis, which I have never encountered with my previous metropolitan practice.  The health disparities and inequalities relating to Indigenous peoples’ health in both Australia and New Zealand are equally prominent, despite the geo graphical distance and the varying histories. Chronic health conditions and youth suicidal rate are increasing in both countries and this is especially prominent in the Indigenous people. The Māori population has slightly more privileges compared to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (ATSI) in all aspects, including health initiatives and health programs to improve health inequality and life expectancy.  The clinical management guideline for most health conditions, such as in emergency, is relativel y similar between Australia and New Zealand. The resuscitation algorithm and drugs used are the same as the guidelines are shared between the countries. The preventative healthcare guidelines outlined by the RACGP Red Book are like NZ practice with some variation such as timing of cervical screening and colorectal screening.   From an ethical perspective, the RACGP and Australian medical board guidelines are very similar to the RNZCGP and NZ medical council guidelines. Ethical practice including professional boundaries and behaviours towards patients and colleagues are similar. The medico -legal aspects such as patient’s rights and capacity for consent, managing patient’s confidentiality and complaints, as well as death reporting process are very similar.  One difference between Australian and New Zealand general practice is the structure of the health care system and the Medicare health insurance system. The Australian health care system is jointly funded by local, federal and state governments, allowing eligible Australian residents access to health care at affordable cost or no cost, along with the option of a subsidized private sector healthcare. The introduction of Medicare since 1984 has provided equal access to cover all cost of public hospital services and some of other health services such as GPs, medical specialists, allied    
 
  
    
  
 
PEP Specialist Stream Reflective Task Example 1   
health, nurses and dental services for children. GPs are responsible for services billed under the correct Medicare billing code. Some general practices offer bulk billing while oth ers have a mixed private and bulk billing options. Bulk billing is where a practice accepts the Medicare rebate only as payment for service and the patient may agree for this to be paid directly to the practice. Private billing is where patients are charged more than the rebate paid by Medicare for the provided service, known as ‘gap payment’. In New Zealand (NZ), General Practices are private businesses and set their own fees for consultations and other health services; in accordance with thresholds agreed  by District Health Boards and Primary Health Organisation (PHO). Some practices join a Very Low-Cost Access (VLCA) programme run by PHOs where government funding is provided to the practice directly to keep patient fees at a low level for enrolled patients. Most practices offer zero fees visits for aged 13 and under, and cheaper visits for all community service cardholders and their dependents.  The remoteness of my current practice meant more challenges to face and more resilience necessary to overcome these challenges. One of the challenges I have found is the limited secondary and tertiary healthcare service available locally for optimisation of patient healthcare. The nearest large hospital with major health services available is about 100km away (Toowoo mba). The local rural hospitals, at times, have inadequate staffing and lack some services. Medicare bulk -billing healthcare services options are very limited locally including psychology and allied health. A long waitlist usually follows upon referral or sometimes rejection from referrals due to an overflow in booking. A private referral is an option but most patients in Nanango are from a low socio -economic background (unemployed or pensioners), who cannot afford to pay for such services and may have issues accessing transport to get to health services. I have had to become more resourceful to search for alternative options for these patients, such as seeking DVA funding, or sourcing Telehealth consultations to help with transport issues.  There is a relatively high degree of opioid and benzodiazepine use among patients in my current practice. I have found this challenging to manage, especially with the discussion of weaning them off these medications. Many are patients who have been on opioids and benzodia zepine for years, and I ‘inherited’ these patients when I joined the practice. It was challenging initially as I was a new doctor to these patients and had inadequate rapport with these patients.  Rapport is particularly hard when patients’ prescription expectations are not met, but over time and with relationship building, I was able to negotiate a management plan with most patients including a discussion on rationale for discontinued use of these medications and/or goals for tapering of the doses where to lerated. There is still a minority of patients who are resistant to plan negotiation and insistent on continued high doses of these medications. With resources from PEP program and the RACGP guidelines on S8/drug of dependence prescribing, I am more confident in managing these patients and aware of contact details available to seek for advice or second opinion for complex high -risk users. The Q script online learning system is a good resource to assist with opioids and benzodiazepine prescribing for my

patients as it allows me to keep track on patient dispensing history. I am thankful for the pathways to refer patients to chronic pain or ATOD services for those patients who are difficult to manage.  A significant problem with my current practice is the patie nt management software. Correspondence from other health care providers, pathology, radiology,  or the department of health seem to be variably lodged in different places of the program because of  automated systems combined with human filing systems. This has created significant time wastage, as we must  comb through all the different tabs to tease out relevant data. There is a potential risk of information going missing and lost to follow-up, such as with important investigation results or pathology requests being lost to follow-up due to inadequate user alerts within the software. This can cause significant compromise in patient care. To combat this potential loophole, I keep a written task list to check important test requests made and ensure that patients always arrange another appointment at the front desk (for results review and to prevent them being lost to follow- up). A better patient management software package can be considered. My previous practice’s patient management software has easily identified tabs for clinic letter correspondences, radiology and pathology results. The software program also incorporated an automatic trigger system with reminders on all test requests made to reduce risk of patient loss to follow -up. One of the key learning points from completing the PEP learning units is the Medicare billing and claiming process. I have developed a better understanding on claiming responsibilities including use of the correct Medicare item codes for services provided. Medicare Benefit Schedule has a list of subsidized medical services, with correct billing codes readily accessible online for references on MBS online. Penalties may apply for incorrect claimed services. Services Australia website has contact details and resources to assist health professionals with Medicare billing. Besides, I have come to familiarize with various health benefit card entitlements available to patient including pension and unemployment benefits, as well as other healthcare funding options available if no n- Medicare funded services access required, such as the Department of Veteran’s Affairs (DVA) and Workplace health and safety indemnity. Another key point learned is safe prescribing process and regulations, including S8 medication prescribing. Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) online has information on medication scheduling basics to help understanding on medication classification system in Australia. Both Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) online and RACGP guideline have resources to help GP with S8 prescribing including PBS authority application rules for S8 prescription and strict legislative requirements involving request for prescribing approval from the Chief Executive at Queensland Health for drug dependent individuals. In Queensland, it has b ecome mandatory for prescribers to review online real-time prescription monitoring system (Q script) prior to prescribing, dispensing, or giving a treatment dose monitored medicines such as S8s. The Q script online learning portal serves as a good platform for GP to be familiarized with this system.

An important learning point for me is the impact of historical experiences and intergenerational trauma on the Indigenous peoples’ health. The resultant fear of discrimination and loss of cultural identity are potential contributing factors for poor healthcare access for ATSI people and high rates of chronic health conditions such as diabetes, anxiety/depression, drug use and alcohol binge. With this knowledge, I am more culturally aware and sensitive when provid ing healthcare to ATSI patients, cultivating a holistic approach involving the local ATSI community as it has been suggested that the strength of the Indigenous cultural community to be a protective factor in prevention of chronic disease and mental illness. There are health initiatives and community services available under Medicare funding to assist with health preventative measures and emotional wellbeing for the ATSI people, which should be utilized.  One of the key aspects for my future learning is med icinal cannabis prescribing. Medicinal cannabis is an emerging therapeutic modality that has seen significant uptake across the world. Potential therapeutic areas include but not limited to management of chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, palliative care, anxiety, chemotherapy induced nausea/vomiting. In Australia, medicinal cannabis is available for management of certain conditions and prescribers must apply to the TGA under the special access scheme to prescribe cannabis compounds to patients (vi a their portal). I will need to do more research on the efficacy of medical cannabis and attend webinars or courses on this topic before I feel more comfortable prescribing these medications. Evidence based systemic review journal readings such as from Pubmed is another helpful resource for my learning on medicinal cannabis. In line with the government’s ‘Closing the gap program’ to achieve health equality and life expectancy, I wish to learn more practical ways to work towards this goal in daily practice. ATSI peoples view health as being connected to community and connection to the land. I plan to engage with the local Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Service and Aboriginal Medical Services which are in Kingaroy, to identify social, emotional, mental and physical health needs that I can address to provide this holistic care. I aim to also research ‘Closing the gap’ initiatives and outreach programs. Some patients have approached me with the question of wanting gene testing to identify if they have a genetic risk for cancer. Currently my knowledge extends only to tumour markers in serology and identification of the BRCA gene. I would like to have a better understanding of genetic testing available and to become more confident in offering advice for patients, for instance, in pregnancy planning and those requesting personal gene testing. My research on this will be from RACGP guidelines, National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) resources, Medline, Google and local medical institutes.
