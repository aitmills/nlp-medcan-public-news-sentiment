 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Crikey speaks to the makers of Green Light, a new documentary about the black-market entrepreneurs serving the massive demand for medicinal marijuana in Australia. Amber Schultz Oct 10, 2019  3 It’s rare that entrepreneurs implore governments to put them out of business by flooding the market — but that’s exactly what the duo behind a black market medicinal cannabis company want. A new Australian documentary, Green Light, follows two men running an underground medicinal marijuana ring as they prescribe and administer cannabinoids to patients who struggle to access it legally. Treating everything from a face tumour the size of a saucer, to a bump on a horse’s nose, the duo have tens of thousands of patients across the country. It’s a documentary deliberately light on evidence but heavy on testimonies, using patients’ stories to tug on heartstrings and raising questions about medicinal cannabis legislation.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Legalising the herb would be good for the public, good for police and bad for lawyers, say Crikey readers. (But it's not for everyone.) Crikey Jan 25, 2023  43 Colby Hanks: As a long-time beneficiary of medicinal cannabis, I very much support its use (“Australians still waiting for grass to grow for medicinal cannabis use”). The current schedule is too narrow in scope and most GPs have little interest in prescribing it. Legalising it for recreational use would not only introduce a host of laws regarding quality, but it would also bring in untold taxation benefits — and all at the expense of organised crime!   When the health deficits of cannabis are less than either alcohol or tobacco, what’s not to like? Daniel Phelan writes: I have had chronic pain for some 15 years, which has badly affected sleep. I have had a hip transplant, sacroiliac nerves burnt out, psoas tendon treated and many sleeping tables, opioids, etc, taken — all unsatisfactory. Over the past three years, small amounts of medicinal THC cannabis taken at bedtime give me a good night’s sleep.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au An unusual alliance of senators including the Greens and One Nation teamed up against the government to allow fast-tracked access to medicinal cannabis. Josh Taylor Jun 14, 2017  3 A group of unlikely allies teamed up in the Senate on Tuesday to fast-track access to medicinal cannabis for people suffering from terminal illnesses. Last month, a Greens/Labor-backed motion failed in the Senate that would have fast-tracked access to medicinal cannabis for people with terminal illnesses by allowing doctors to simply notify — rather than ask the permission of — the Therapeutic Goods Administration when they intend to treat a patient with a terminal illness using medicinal cannabis. The Senate vote was tied after Pauline Hanson’s One Nation voted with the government and the Nick Xenophon Team to block it, while Jacqui Lambie was absent from the chamber for the vote. A letter from Health Minister Greg Hunt to the Nick Xenophon Team tabled in Parliament at the time showed Hunt was lobbying the crossbench for their support, playing up their protectionist tendencies, claiming that the motion would disadvantage local suppliers because it would require them to go through the longer registration process — meaning those who were terminally ill would simply import their medicinal cannabis. Hunt also went on Sky News to claim that such a proposal was “irresponsible, ill-thought through and utterly dangerous” because it would lead to “bricks of hashish to come through our airports”.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Most people use marijuana to manage pain — and boredom. Now, as lockdown drags, medicinal cannabis approvals have reached new highs. Amber Schultz Aug 19, 2020  11 Cannabis is the COVID-19 drug of choice in Australia after alcohol. Self-reported usage rates have soared and medicinal cannabis approvals are at record rates, increasing by almost 40% since telehealth was implemented in April.  Australians are turning to marijuana during the pandemic for prescribed medication, self-medication, and as an alternative to other substances.  In July last year the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved 2207 medicinal cannabis applications. By July this year that had shot up to 5564 — a 60% increase.  Become a subscriber to get full access to the website, as well as our premium newsletters.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Despite the prehistoric plant being allowed to be prescribed for medical use in 2016, its use as medicine has been disappointingly limited.  Mitchell Squire Jan 24, 2023  10 Australia is likely to see the decriminalisation and retail of cannabis well before its widespread medical use. Since it was downscheduled in 2016 by the Therapeutic Goods Administration to allow it to be prescribed by any doctor in Australia, its uptake as medicine has been limited. That is disappointing since the anti-inflammatory and psychotropic effects of cannabis — and the ubiquity of inflammation and stress as determinants of disease — make it a potentially useful drug for many common health conditions.  The major cannabinoids (active ingredients) of the cannabis flower are cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). When consumed by humans, THC and CBD activate cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 — these propagate and modify activity in the central nervous system, the immune and other organ systems. Any molecule, not exclusive to the cannabis plant, that activates these receptors can be described as a cannabinoid — they can be found in other familiar products like black pepper and chocolate.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au No argument from Crikey readers over decriminalising marijuana — it's a no-brainer, says one, and will 'get rid of the dealers and scum'.  Crikey Jan 23, 2023  11 Tim Stephens writes: We need Gough Whitlam back to do what he did with brewing one’s own beer at home (“Is NSW ready for cannabis reform? Weed activists prepare for the election”). Before he acted, it was illegal to brew beer at home even for your own consumption. Since legalisation, brewing has developed into a magic little industry of its own. Society hasn’t collapsed and commercial breweries still exist. Of course cannabis should be decriminalised! What is the coherent argument against me in my own backyard growing a plant or two and doing what I do with my home (craft?) brew? That is, sitting quietly and contemplating the madness of the world with some synaptic enhancement. Get rid of the dealers and scum, for sure.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Change.org's pot petition ... don't look now, Hunt's screwing the environment ... war on Christmas part 42,856 Crikey Dec 22, 2015  3 From the Crikey grapevine, the latest tips and rumours … Signatures that actually change things. As we come to the end of the year, we can only hope that the Twitter outrage machine also takes a break, at least for a couple of weeks. Interestingly the issues that made the biggest impact on petition website Change.org were actually very different than the daily anger churn. Change has released a list of its most successful petitions of the year, covering state and federal politics, getting drugs on the PBS and credit card surcharges. Interestingly, Change.org believes that while the majority of petitions started on the site relate to local government issues, the most successful ones relate to state and federal issues. The most successful petition for the year, with 172,000 signatures, resulted in a drug that treats melanoma being added to the PBS. But the biggest petition of the year is yet to be called a victory. A petition calling for medical cannabis to be decriminalised has more than 250,000 supporters, and although the federal government has announced it will move toward legalising medicinal cannabis, the campaigners won’t call it a victory until legislation is passed. What do we pay you for? Most of think we pay our politicians to make decisions for the country, but over in the UK the Scottish National Party has decided, after doing its own research, that MPs have “wasted” six working days by voting since the general election in May. The SNP is using the stat to lobby for electronic voting, which is already in place in the Scottish Parliament. While the UK also has the Westminster system of government, UK MPs don’t just vote by crossing the chamber like here in Australia — they walk down “aye” or “no” corridors, which are known as lobbies. The SNP says this takes on average 15 minutes every time there is a vote. We think keeping the current system is also good for the pollies’ health — at least this way they get to get up for a walk every now and then.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Who does one believe when the spinners are spinning for themselves? Emily Watkins Feb 12, 2018  1 The spin cycle around professional spinners M+C Partners is gathering speed. The small PR firm is currently facing a court action from Asher Moses, a former executive with the company, for unfair dismissal. In response to his claim — that he was sacked after he was diagnosed with depression and that the company is trying to avoid paying out his equity entitlements — M+C Partners filed a defence with the court saying that his dismissal was related to being affected by cannabis while at work and not showing up in required hours. The battle has been played out partly in the media, as well as the courts, with a piece in the Australian Financial Review‘s Rear Window column last week prompting an internal email at M+C to “correct” some parts of the column. One point of contention was Rear Window’s reference to a “rumoured” mural of “what could be interpreted as a skunk smoking a joint”. The Fin was assured it was a cigar, which the company — which represents a number of medicinal cannabis companies — repeated in the internal email.

That the obstacle to its proposed company tax cuts should be Tim Storer — a neophyte independent washed on the Senate shore amid the wreckage of the Nick Xenophon Team — will have many in the government calling to mind Paul Keating’s famed characterisation of the upper chamber as “unrepresentative swill”. Storer’s credentials as a representative of South Australia rest upon a grand total of 189 primary votes received at the 2016 election, with the vast majority of the votes that elected him having filtered through the ticket of a party he now refuses to represent.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Has Nick Xenophon forgot where he came from? ... Wilders in the wilderness .. Andrews jumps the gun ... Crikey Oct 05, 2015  4 From the Crikey grapevine, the latest tips and rumours … Xenophon turns on micro-parties? The Australian reports today that Nick Xenophon has written to new Special Minister of State Mal Brough proposing Senate electoral reforms that would make it harder for micro-parties to get elected through complex preference deals. Xenophon proposed that group voting tickets be abolished, with people be required to number at least three squares above the line, or be required to number just 12 candidates below the line. It’s a bold move from Xenophon, who has in the past wielded considerable influence over the independent and micro-party crossbenchers, who are understandably not keen on any plans that would leave them unable to get elected at the end of their terms. While Xenophon is now the third-biggest force in South Australian politics, pulling almost enough votes for two Senate places at the last election, he seems to have forgotten how he started out. Xenophon was first elected to South Australian Parliament on the back of preferences, but he has since gained enough of a profile to get elected without them.

Anton Nilsson Apr 06, 2023  106 Cannabis would be available to be bought and smoked at Amsterdam-style cafés or grown at home under a legalisation bill written by the Greens.  Adults would be allowed to grow up to six plants at home for private consumption, and there would be no upper weight limit for possession, according to the bill drafted by Senator David Shoebridge.  “This bill could legalise cannabis in one go across the country with a simple and coherent national scheme for growing, distribution, sales and taxation,” he said. “What we have created with this bill is a core set of principles for an ethical cannabis market that is controlled by individuals and small businesses rather than big pharma, big tobacco or big alcohol.” Become a subscriber to get full access to the website, as well as our premium newsletters.

Crikey intern Naomi Lim has the latest results. Crikey Nov 07, 2012  5 From legalising pot to cleaning up potty behaviour, voters across America are deciding on a raft of radical social reforms as well as the presidential race for the White House. Marijuana legalisation, gay marriage and assisted suicide are some of the red-hot issues being decided by voters in 38 states. There are 176 such measures on the ballots, an increase from 159 in 2010. Gay rights advocates are confident Maine, Maryland and Washington will vote in favour of ballot measures to legalise same-s-x marriage, and Minnesota will overturn a ban on gay marriage in the state constitution.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Advocates are calling on the Australian government to take a leaf out of Biden’s book and finally decriminalise cannabis. Julia Bergin Oct 07, 2022  6 US President Joe Biden has pardoned thousands of Americans with federal cannabis convictions, reigniting the debate around whether Australia should do the same for its citizens — or go a step further and decriminalise the drug altogether.  It comes a week after the Greens launched a campaign to legalise cannabis nationally. “This is really exciting from an Australian perspective because it shows how important action by the federal government is when it comes to cannabis law reform,” Greens Senator David Shoebridge told Crikey. “This answers those few critics who have been saying it’s not the job of the federal government to advance federal law reform.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au I became and remain the first patient in Australia with my particular Parkinson's disease  symptoms to legally obtain and use a revolutionary cannabis-based medicine, writes Graham Irvine, a law lecturer and broadcaster. Crikey Oct 21, 2010  2 After nine months of bureaucratic processes, in 2009, I became and remain the first patient in Australia with my particular Parkinson’s disease (PD) symptoms to legally obtain and use a revolutionary cannabis-based medicine in a three-month clinical trial. Sativex is not legal in Australia and its importation from Britain cost me $1000. But it did little to ease my symptoms, which was unfortunate not only for me but for the other 80,000 PD sufferers who could potentially benefit from the drug. There are two glaring problems with this pharmaceutical. First, the psychoactive effects of its 55% THC content are claimed to be balanced by its other active ingredient, cannabinol, which is not psychoactive but has other medicinal properties. However, that was not my experience for I became stoned every time I took it. Become a subscriber to get full access to the website, as well as our premium newsletters.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Voters approved recreational marijuana in California yesterday, and four states also approved minimum wage increases.  Glenn Dyer Nov 10, 2016 The presidential poll was not the only thing on the ballot yesterday in the United States. Results of some down-ballot measures show a more liberal and reformist agenda still exists among tens of millions of Americans who voted in some states to tighten gun controls, in some cities and towns to tighten the sugar content of soft drinks, and in some states for freeing up of laws restricting personal use of marijuana. Take California — the country’s biggest and at times most radical state — which legalised recreational marijuana. Some local areas voted to impose soda sugar taxes, while voters rejected a move to end capital punishment. Californians 21 and older will be able to possess, transport, buy and use up to an ounce of cannabis for recreational purposes, individuals can grow as many as six plants. The measure would also allow retail sales of marijuana and impose a 15% tax. The measure only allows non-medical marijuana to be sold by state licensed businesses, and it gives the state until January 1, 2018, to begin issuing sales licences for recreational retailers. California legalised medical use dope years ago. Voters in Nevada and Massachusetts also decided to legalise cannabis for recreational use, while voters in four more states — Florida, North Dakota and Arkansas and Montana — legalised the medical use of marijuana or eased restrictions. These four states all voted strongly for Donald Trump. Become a subscriber to get full access to the website, as well as our premium newsletters.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Crikey readers discuss marriage equality and other issues of the day. Crikey Aug 28, 2015  5 Get your dogs in a row David Salter writes: Re. “Dog days are over” (yesterday). Call that a Springer Spaniel? This is a Springer Spaniel — my beloved and faithful woofer Brandy.  By the way, for the canine pedants, there are three kinds of Springers: English (like my Brandy), Welsh, and American (like the lovely dog George Bush had at the White House – his only redeeming feature). On productivity John Kotsopoulos writes: Re. “The challenge of lifting productivity” (yesterday). There is a challenge involved in lifting productivity when you can’t measure but what is the point.  These days so much of this “productivity” includes financial service industries that churn money and clip tickets  and the monetizing of activities that used to be done by family and friends such as childcare and elder care. Strip these zero sum items out of the equation and it seems to me that we have had zero or negative productivity for some time and living standards have only risen because of fortuitous events like the rise of China and the mining boom “Service industries” are the fools gold of the modern era.  They are not sustainable without a solid manufacturing base which we must maintain whatever the short term cost. Neil Hauxwell: Leave the targeting of workers; let’s look at the “productivity” of  Australia’s business leadership.  Trading conditions tough?  Board and CEO bereft of an original idea? Hey, we’ll flog the whole shebang to a multinational! Shareholders get to buy  new Mercs. CEO and board  grab a quick buck and move on. Never mind the downside” jobs lost, R&D hived off to who knows where, profits and taxes “disappeared” to Lichtenstein.  Australia ratcheted another click to Banana  Republic economic status.  Roam the aisles of retail and check the proportion of great brands now in offshore hands.  Check the share holdings of our extractive industries.  It’s time for some national economic self-interest. Real reform Richard Barlow writes: Re. “Talk is cheap: we need action, not more hot air, on reform” (yesterday). If national “reform” is not happening let’s have an election and change the government, then Fairfax and News can get back to screeching “Class War” every time someone has a vaguely sensible idea. Gillard changes her mind Ken Lambert writes: Re. “We will not be lectured about marriage equality by this woman” (yesterday). Well, this time Crikey is spot on! Gillard has shown us again what she really stands for: expedience — in spite of all principle; compromise — no matter what the facts of the matter; survival — no matter how craven the actions may be. Jenny Thomas writes: I take issue with your attack on Gillard over same-sex marriage. If indeed her primary concern was to “hold on to the top job at any cost”, she was doing the nation a great favour. We could have had Abbott two years earlier or an earlier return to Rudd, God help us. There can be no doubt that by holding on to the job she herself was paying a serious personal price, and the nation unwittingly benefited, getting a chance to see a better future through decent financial management, a climate change mechanism,  a glimpse at an NDIS, an NBN that worked,and a Gonski.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au The man who made the bomb that killed more than 200 people, including 88 Australians, in a Bali nightclub in 2002 has been freed, and Brittany Higgins will take the stand in any defamation action by Bruce Lehrmann. Emma Elsworthy Dec 08, 2022  8 Bali bombmaker Umar Patek has been released from jail after serving just over half of his 20-year sentence, the ABC reports, something Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called “abhorrent”. Patek helped build the bomb that killed more than 200 people, including 88 Australians, in a Bali nightclub in 2002 — he was on the run for nine years as one of Asia’s most wanted terrorism suspects before being caught. Patek was a senior figure in the al-Qaeda-linked network Jemaah Islamiyah, as Guardian Australia continues, and the Indonesian government said he had completed a “deradicalisation” program while inside. So why was Patek released? He received 33 months of sentence reductions — Indonesia often gives them to prisoners on national holidays — which left him eligible for parole after serving two-thirds of his sentence. Staying overseas a moment and Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong will tell the US that both of us need to show the Indo-Pacific that our alliance is not just about military cooperation and security, but economics too, as the SMH reports, that we want to “do business and create wealth” with countries as well. Wong will say that it’s about showing we “have skin in the game” by getting involved in “development, connectivity, digital trade and the energy transition”, otherwise we risk being outplayed by China. Wong will also urge Beijing to take up a US offer to put “guardrails” in place to manage competition, saying it was in “all the world’s interests”, Guardian Australia continues. If you’d like to delve into the issue more, The Conversation has a cracking analysis this morning. Former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins says she’d be happy to take the witness stand in a defamation action after the man once accused of raping her, Bruce Lehrmann, hired defamation lawyer Mark O’Brien. The rape charge against Lehrmann has been dropped. Lehrmann is reportedly sizing up Channel 10’s The Project and the ABC over a National Press Club speech, but there’s a heck of a lot of media reporting and speeches to go through, news.com.au noted. Higgins tweeted “If required I am willing to defend the truth as a witness in any potential civil cases brought about by Mr Lehrmann” yesterday from a Queensland hospital, The Australian ($) reports. So who is O’Brien? He’s acted for VC ­recipient Ben Roberts-Smith, actor Craig McLachlan, former treasurer Joe Hockey and businessman Chau Chak Wing and is known for his “aggressive approach” as a lawyer, the paper says. Hey, speaking of lawyers — the Aboriginal Legal Service (ALS) has fronted the Supreme Court of WA over cell lockdowns at Banksia Hill and Casuarina Prison, The West ($) reports. The ALS says the lockdowns (caused by staff shortages) should be unlawful — indeed one kid was in his cell for more than 20 hours a day for 26 days this year — which is an astounding and dismal fact. The court agreed they were unlawful, but they’ve continued, ALS says. An urgent hearing will take place tomorrow. Junior doctors at a Sydney hospital have been told napping on quiet night shifts is forbidden and management would replace lounges with “less comfortable chairs” if it didn’t stop, the ABC reports. An email said doctors were not being “paid to sleep” and should have a “cup of tea” instead. Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital apologised after the letter was posted online, calling it an “insensitive and inappropriate email”. The Australian Medical Association (AMA) NSW pointed to a recent study that found half of all doctors in training who work overtime had stuffed up something because they were so tired. It is kind of a bizarre fact that the people entrusted with our lives often work intensely long hours, have unpredictable rosters, do overtime, wait around on-call, and work night shifts. In 2016, the AMA got a bunch of doctors to record their work hours, with several reporting single shifts that lasted as long as 72, 59, 58 and 53 hours. Meanwhile, the national AMA has called the refusal to reinstate the mask mandate “weak political leadership”, Guardian Australia reports, saying it was the best policy for stopping COVID infections. We need a plan that “relies on more than vaccination”, the peak body said, with one expert warning 1 million Australians could have long COVID by 2023. It comes as the country’s peak actuarial body says the government should urgently investigate why 13% more people died this year in Australia, news.com.au reports. An extra 15,400 people died in the first eight months of the year, according to analysis of Australian Bureau of Statistics data by the Actuaries Institute. A third of the deaths had no link to COVID — it’s an “incredibly high number for mortality”, and actuary Karen Cutter said she has no idea what’s behind it. An Adelaide woman hasn’t put her bin out for two years, and no, this isn’t an angry neighbour story worthy of a segment on A Current Affair. Alice Clanachan just didn’t need to — she has basically no rubbish worthy of the regular bin thanks to an extremely thorough approach to “reduce, reuse, recycle”, as Guardian Australia reports. Clanachan was like, I probably could’ve gone longer than 26 months, but it was getting a bit hot out. So what was in the bin? Mostly tradie rubbish like repairs from old pipes or drains, but also worn-out gardening gloves, rapid antigen tests, thermal paper receipts, vacuum cleaner dust, dental floss and broken ceramics. Fascinating. Wondering how this is possible? Clanachan said she doesn’t drive a car, and cycling to get the groceries keeps the items she buys pretty low. She takes her own glass containers for grains and rice, and buys a lot of produce from farmers markets where they’re not practically vacuumed-sealed in plastic. She doesn’t really buy pre-packaged food, gives egg cartons to people with backyard hens, and even gives yoghurt containers to a friend who grows mushrooms. When fellow Adelaidian Trudy Conroy heard about Clanachan, she was livid. Conroy’s record was about 18 months, and she’s sure she would’ve gone further if not for this old manky pillow no one wanted. “It felt a bit weird putting it out, it had spiderwebs and duct tape on it,” Conroy said. Hoping you lighten your footprint in some small way today. A 32-year-old climate activist is about to be imprisoned for 456 days for stopping traffic for 24 minutes.

And it provided the Liberals, up to and including Scott Morrison, with a parallel universe within which to live and operate, ultimately to their downfall. “In the News Corp universe, climate action was the obsession of a few inner-city soyaccino drinkers, trans people were enemies to be smitten hip and thigh as a first-order matter of public policy, gender and workplace issues were a minority obsession foreign to the experience of ordinary Australian women, and Morrison was a political genius and master tactician. Sadly, May 21 2022 confirmed this parallel universe had minimal overlap with planet earth.” Cam Wilson Dec 07, 2022  5  “In January, Grove projected that Junkee’s traffic and revenue numbers would return to their 2019 peak by the middle of the year, even after he was warned by staff that this wasn’t possible. Grove’s plans to replicate the success of The Daily Aus and The Betoota Advocate, which had grown their audience through social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, simply wasn’t feasible in 2022 since Meta had changed its algorithms. It wasn’t going to be as simple as using the old playbook. “Multiple Junkee staff told Crikey that Grove had claimed he sold his stake in The Daily Aus and invested $1.2 million into Scout Publishing. Suddenly in May, staff were brought into a meeting room. Grove appeared via video from an Adelaide hotel room. He told the staff that both Junkee’s chief operating officer Rob Stott and editor-in-chief Gyan Yankovich had accepted redundancies and wouldn’t be returning.” Michael Bradley Dec 07, 2022  47  “Deanna “Violet” Coco is incarcerated, denied bail and sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment — with a non-parole period of eight months — for blocking traffic on the Sydney Harbour Bridge, possessing an orange flare in a public place and resisting police (not violently; she just refused to move on). Coco was protesting to raise awareness of climate change. “Nicolaas Bester was in court in Hobart on Monday, charged with three counts of using a carriage service to menace or harass former Australian of the Year Grace Tame. Bester was Tame’s high school teacher. He groomed and serially raped her over six months when she was 15. It was not, to be clear, a relationship. On arrest police found 28 pieces of child pornography.” Zelenskyy named Time magazine’s ‘Person of the Year’ (Al Jazeera) Sister of Iran’s supreme leader condemns protest crackdown (The Guardian) Bank of Canada raises rate again to 4.25% — but opens door to staying there (CBC) Nigerian military ran secret mass abortion program in war on Boko Haram (Reuters) Germany coup plot: police raid far-right terrorist suspects behind bid ‘to overthrow government’ (EuroNews) Taliban carry out first public execution since taking over Afghanistan (The Guardian) Microsoft strikes 10-year deal with Nintendo over Call of Duty (Stuff) Disjointed pot policy puts dopey Australia behind rest of world — John Ryan (SMH): “There have been 700,000 arrests for cannabis-related offending in Australia in the past 12 years, more than 90% of them for personal use or possession. That is the extraordinary finding from a study released today by public health research and drug policy organisation the Penington Institute. That’s hundreds of thousands of Australians entering the criminal justice system for use of a drug that likely does little harm to them and no measurable harm to others … “Australia is now well out of step globally on this issue. Over the past two decades, momentum from health leaders around the world has been gathering to question the spectacularly ineffective and harmful ‘War on Drugs’ and seek constructive alternatives. Countries including Canada, Thailand and Uruguay have passed legislation either decriminalising or legalising cannabis, as have many states in the US. Recently, US President Joe Biden issued an official pardon for all citizens convicted of simple possession of cannabis under federal law.” Kirstie Alley was a fat, glamorous actress. That was radical — Jennifer Weiner (The New York Times): “Fat actresses, fat singers or dancers or stars are still few and far between. But there are a handful, and their weight isn’t always their entire plot arc, and they’re not always the butt of the joke. And social media’s given all of us — thin, fat and in between — a soapbox to share our opinions. Women can call out designers when they don’t offer extended sizing, or complain when, for dramatic effect, a music video shows the actually quite thin Taylor Swift stepping on a scale that reads FAT. “Fitness magazines wrestle with fatphobia in the health and wellness industry and put larger women like the yoga instructor Jessamyn Stanley on their covers (to the tittering disdain of men who can’t wait to tell their followers how gross it is). Plus-size influencers flourish on social media. And Lizzo continues to redefine the game, whether she’s wearing couture in Vanity Fair, ruling the red carpets, racking up Emmy and Grammy wins, launching a size-inclusive shapewear brand or creating a reality show to launch the next generation of ‘big grrrls’ into stardom — all while living joyously in her larger body. The world is changing. And Kirstie Alley was a part of that change, whether she meant to be or not.”  Online Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek will discuss her plans for environmental reform in Queensland.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au The current policy settings around cannabis are clearly failing. Richard Di Natale is right to try to find an alternative. Greg Barns Apr 18, 2018  40 Greens leader Richard Di Natale’s push to legalise cannabis makes sense at so many levels, not least of which is a correlated reduction in general crime rates which is highly likely to occur if weed is no longer sold on the black market. In those American jurisdictions that have legalised cannabis for recreational and medical purposes there has been a marked drop in property crimes and crimes of violence. Take Washington state. It legalised cannabis in 2012. Oregon, next door, legalised in 2014. A 2017 paper by Davide Dragone for the German based IZA Institute, found that that the “legalization of recreational marijuana caused a significant reduction of rapes and thefts” in those areas of Washington that border Oregon. The decline in crime is significant. Become a subscriber to get full access to the website, as well as our premium newsletters.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Scott Morrison has dismissed yesterday's landmark IPCC report calling for drastic action to avoid catastrophic climate change. It's the news you need to know, from Chris Woods. Chris Woods Oct 09, 2018  3 Prime Minister Scott Morrison has rejected calls from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to rapidly phase out coal-fired power stations, after the IPCC reported that a 1.5 degree hotter planet will be impossible to avoid without a drastic cut to emissions over the next decade. According to The Sydney Morning Herald, the major IPCC report predicts the remaining carbon budget for a 1.5 degree increase is set to be wiped out under global trends over the next decade, with even that threshold seeing a 70-90% decline in coral reefs. However Morrison, backed by members of the resources sector and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg ($), has argued that Australia is not “bound” to meet any of the report’s conclusions or “to tip money into that big climate fund“. While Labor and the Greens have since attacked the Coalition over the report, Morrison has reiterated his support for a 26% reduction on 2005 levels, a target the IPCC report paints as insufficient and government data says will not be met under current policies. New Urban ­Infrastructure and Population Minister Alan Tudge will today unveil visa proposals that would require thousands of migrants to settle outside Sydney and Melbourne for up to five years, in a Coalition bid to address population growth. Ahead of the government’s official release of the new population policy, The Australian ($) reports that Tudge will today emphasise an unplanned population spike post-2007, reportedly driven by the Labor government’s lift in immigration and family reunion visas, and an alleged $25 billion a year lost in economic activity due to congestion. Elsewhere, a new Australian National University/University of Melbourne study had found that Australia would risk a chronic shortage of young workers and economic damage from any drastic cuts to the annual migration rate. US President Donald Trump’s trade war with China could soon claim an unlikely target: A-League soccer team the Newcastle Jets. The Australian ($) reports that the Jets’ owner, Chinese multi-billionaire Martin Lee, has considered cutting the team’s budget after Trump’s tariffs slashed the value of his shares in LED lighting company Ledman Optoelectronic over just five months. Lee reportedly floated the idea of cutting as much as $600,000 from Jets’ players wages, but pulled back from the idea. We mightn’t have even started. We haven’t even started. You’ll have to wait and see.  Andrew Crook The media spokesman for Clive Palmer hints that those big yellow billboards and the recent $1 million spent on radio and TV spots in capital cities are just the first we’re going to see ($) of his return to federal politics.  “In 2012, lawyer Geoff Watson likened disgraced NSW politician Eddie Obeid and his ilk to the infamous Rum Corps, a group of soldiers in the early colony who ran the liquor trade and used it to buy power. This ‘whatever it takes’ attitude has been revealed by the corruption watchdog, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, to be endemic to both sides of politics in NSW, where it has long been said that we get the ‘finest politicians money can buy’. “ “Last week the European Parliament approved a local content quota on streaming video services including industry giant Netflix. Under the European agreement, online-only streaming services will be required to produce content in the markets it’s available in, and have local content available in their libraries.” “The debate around the Ramsay Centre’s proposed degrees in Western civilisation continues to divide, with academics at the University of Sydney now considering a boycott over its proposed introduction. But despite hysteria across the political spectrum, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the Ramsay Centre’s curriculum itself. A brief look at an indicative curriculum posted on the centre’s website in June puts the debate in perspective.” Hackers target the Queensland government with online attacks Royal Commission into aged care will be based in Adelaide ($) Women voters in poll position as parties court the female vote Deloitte, EY, KPMG, PwC targeted by ATO ($) ‘I’m not going anywhere’: Perth wetlands protest reaches new heights Former Howard adviser Peter Conran joins Morrison ($) Gunner Government facing angry public backlash as alcohol prices surge ($) Call to action as Australian recycling rates ‘stagnate’ Crossborder rustlers rort NSW drink container refund scheme ($) Voters split on bringing families from Nauru to Australia, poll finds Wealth or greed for their own sake does not define the liberal ($) — Adam Creighton (The Australian): “To be ‘on the Right’ of politics meant supporting the conventional wisdom of that time: lowering taxes on the wealthy, cutting welfare to encourage workforce participation, celebrating the financial services sector and privatising government assets. To be on the Left signalled, mainly, an affection for identity politics. So convincing had the ideas of the Right been that social democratic parties in the US, Britain and Australia pretty much adopted its program.” Seven days, six dead women. When will we wake up? ($) — Sherele Moody (The Courier-Mail): “Six women were killed in the past week. Sixty-two women have suffered violent deaths since January 1. If this is not a national crisis, what the hell is? If a terrorist killed six people in Australia, our country would be in lock down. Major emergencies would be called. Cops would be roaming our streets in greater numbers. Billions of dollars would be set aside for terror-thwarting activities.” Our media’s vested interest in racism — Celeste Liddle (Eureka Street): “In a month where it felt Aboriginal people and other people of colour were continually under attack in this country, the call on Aboriginal commentators to respond to this and therefore convince the public of our humanity reached boiling point. I, and other Aboriginal people I knew, were expressing disillusionment and exhaustion. It was just too much.”  Sydney NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian will be invited to accept a petition signed by more than 225,600 people calling for the Sydney Opera House to not be used as a billboard for horse racing, with the organiser of the petition to hold a press conference outside parliament.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Good morning, early birds. Bill Shorten has set out Labor's energy ambitions, Amnesty reports deteriorating conditions on Manus, and Bali Nine member Renae Lawrence is freed from prison. It's the news you need to know, with Chris Woods. Chris Woods Nov 22, 2018  1 Opposition Leader Bill Shorten will today unveil Labor’s long-expected energy package, which is set to include a more ambitious version of the National Energy Guarantee, rebates for battery installations, and $10 billion for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. The ABC reports that Labor’s adoption of the Coalition’s doomed energy policy is aimed at both tentatively offering a bipartisan solution and leapfrogging expected criticism, while also upgrading the Coalition’s target from 26% to 45% total emissions cuts on 2005 levels by 2030. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that the CEFC funding would allow Labor to invest in new renewable or low-emission energy projects without having to negotiate with either the Coalition or the Greens. A new report into the escalating mental health crisis on Manus Island has coincided with yet another suicide attempt. According to SBS, Amnesty International and the Refugee Council of Australia published the report, titled “Until when? The forgotten men on Manus Island”, just hours after Kurdish journalist and refugee Behrouz Boochani reported the tenth suicide attempt or self harm event in the space of two weeks. The report found that men are suffering after more than five years indefinite detention, cuts to mental and physical health services, and violence from local authorities and members of the public, while Boochani has claimed that Port Morseby’s hospital had inflamed tensions on Tuesday by rejecting a seriously ill refugee. For anyone seeking help, Lifeline can be reach on 13 11 14, and Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636. Convicted Bali Nine drug smuggler Renae Lawrence has become the first and only member of the group to be released from prison, and was deported last night after spending 13 years in Bali’s Bangli prison for trying to smuggle 2.7 kilograms of heroin to Australia. The ABC reports that Lawrence, who had her original life sentence brought down to 20 years on appeal and then 13 due to good behaviour and Indonesia’s national holidays, is in good health and will arrive in Brisbane this morning. Lawrence is now banned from returning to Bali for life and faces outstanding charges relating to a car theft and high-speed chase in Sydney 2005. We’ll tender to the sector, whatever the markets decides, we’ll tender out.  Michael Lamb Frankston’s Liberal candidate and Sky News’ David Speers provide the closest thing we’ll ever get to a spontaneous Clarke and Dawe sketch.  “The same policy breakdown that has occurred in other areas of neoliberal policymaking is now occurring on immigration. It’s generating the same response as in other areas. And it has the same causes. Rinse, repeat. Scott Morrison, who only a matter of months ago was an ardent defender of high immigration, now wants to cut it. The PM says he has heard the complaints of residents of Sydney and Melbourne about congestion and access to services and housing.” “A Tasmanian man named Allan Maccaul copped a $500 fine this week after he shouted ‘you’re a fucking muppet, you’re a fucking muppet’ at Prime Minister Scott Morrison, at the Bathurst 1000 in early October. But wait, in the land where we apparently laud the larrikin, calling the PM a fucking muppet (hell, 50% of that description comes from Morrison himself) gets you set upon by the Protection Operations Unit?” “Anderson’s comments are some of the strongest to come directly from the ABC regarding successive governments’ cuts to the broadcaster. Following the government’s cuts in the 2018 budget, Guthrie, who was still managing director at the time, said the cuts would ‘make it very difficult for the ABC to meet its charter requirements and audience expectations’. That had followed repeated complaints from Communications Minister Mitch Fifield and others government MPs to the ABC regarding its editorial decisions and coverage.” As bad as a Muslim hate preacher: Ex Border Force boss wants Gavin McInnes banned from Australia Commonwealth Bank board asked former chairman to return fees, inquiry told 109 South Australians given medicinal cannabis prescriptions so far this year ($) Victorian Liberals to shut down injecting room in a week if elected Speaker Sue Hickey reaffirms support for Government as Health Minister condemns gender law reform as ‘social experiment’ ($) Police red shirts probe has been undermined from within, insider says Victorian state election 2018: Coalition promises $5b boost by leasing off sewage business ($) Protesters interrupt Greens MLC’s final speech defending Buckingham Scott Morrison considers roping in ‘Bob Katter wrangler’ ($) Morrison’s ‘captain’s call’ on Israel embassy was a misguided stunt — John Hewson (Sydney Morning Herald): “To be absolutely clear, and ignoring the tsunami of subsequent hubris and spin, this was the Prime Minister’s captain’s call, made within a week of the Wentworth by-election, made in desperation, without consultation with DFAT, other relevant advisers, or cabinet, in an ill-conceived, naive attempt to win the so-called Jewish vote.” Deliver what community wants or get off the bench ($) — Graham Richardson (The Australian) “If any improvement in this is to occur, there will need to be new methods of holding magistrates and judges to account. If magistrates ignore their community, then some counselling should be tried. This would let them know they are on thin ice. If their sentencing continued to be way out of line, a better mechanism than placing them before the parliament needs to be found.” Kelly O’Dwyer’s boondoggles and bastardry — Eleanor Robertson (Meanjin): “A little-used expression that I really like is ‘praising with faint damnation’. The opposite of a more popular saying, ‘damning with faint praise’, it describes a way of politely under-reacting to something truly stupid or awful. It’s the ‘you’re going to need a bigger boat’ of political discourse. I thought of it yesterday when I read Tanya Plibersek’s reaction to the government’s Women’s Economic Security Statement.”  Sydney Labor leader Bill Shorten will announce the opposition’s energy policy at BloombergNEF event. Stop Adani protests are also planned for outside the building. India’s President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Scott Morrison will present keynote speeches at the Australian Financial Review’s India Business Summit. Westpac CEO Brian Hartzer will continue giving evidence at the banking royal commission’s policy hearing before Macquarie Group CEO Nicholas Moore is set to appear. The House of Reps communications committee inquiry into Australian music industry will hear from Spotify, ABC, MEAA, and music industry representatives. Melbourne Victorian Labor leader Daniel Andrews and Liberal leader Matthew Guy will take part in an ABC debate ahead of the November 24 election. A federal senate inquiry into Australia’s animal extinction crisis will begin hearings with first witness Professor David Lindenmayer from the Wilderness Society. The House Economics Committee inquiry into the implications of removing refundable franking credits will hold a public hearing. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg will attend Ronald McDonald House North Fitzroy at Casa Elda Vaccari for the opening of its newly renovated $4.4 million House, which will reportedly offer support to more than 1,000 families each year. Former Liberal Deputy Leader and Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop will deliver an address at La Trobe University on conservative politics in Australia. Brisbane The 2018 Walkley Awards for Excellence in Journalism will be presented at a Brisbane gala.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Good morning, early birds. More details revealed about Essendon crash, and Benjamin Netanyahu arrives in Australia. It's the news you need to know, by Sally Whyte and Max Chalmers. Sally Whyte Feb 22, 2017 The five people killed in a fiery plane crash at Essendon airport yesterday have been identified as Australian pilot Max Quartermain and four American tourists heading to King Island on a golf trip. Labor Left is pushing for high-income earners to pay more tax, The Sydney Morning Herald reports today. The idea, which has been labelled a “Buffett rule” after US rich lister Warren Buffett, is said to be an answer to populist parties like One Nation. Mandatory minimum tax rates for high earners could mean that people above a certain annual income pay more tax than they currently do. Heath Aston writes: “The Buffett rule, which is designed to end the relentless pursuit of tax loopholes by corporate advisers on behalf of wealthy clients, is named after American tycoon Warren Buffett who once remarked that it was a nonsense that his secretary paid a higher percentage of income tax than him simply because he could afford better accounting advice.” It’s not a done deal though; the idea has opposition within the ranks of Labor Right. Seven’s injunction against former employee Amber Harrison was extended by Justice Robert McDougall yesterday, even after media companies teamed up to get the gag order quashed. The court heard Harrison, who says she was unfairly targeted by the company after having an affair with CEO Tim Worner, made email threats to “destroy” Worner. The Guardian‘s Amanda Meade writes: “According to emails produced by Seven sent by Harrison after the affair with Worner was over, Harrison said she would unleash a ‘reign of terror’ aimed at ‘finishing’ Worner, a married man with four children.” The injunction was extended until March 3, although Seven asked for an permanent ban on Harrison releasing documents on Twitter. The sale of medical cannabis to assist Australians with severe illnesses will be legalised, Health Minister Greg Hunt will announce today. The Daily Telegraph reports in an exclusive that companies will be able to legally sell cannabis oils and medications, meaning waiting times for those in severe pain will be slashed. Although the use of medical cannabis for those with illnesses such as cancer and motor neurone disease was legalised last year, without a legal local market, those with prescriptions to access the drug had to import the products or use the black market. Hunt said: “We have listened to the concerns of patients and their families that are having difficulty accessing the product while domestic production becomes available.” Sydney: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrives in Australia today, holding bilateral talks with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at Kirribilli House. Turnbull will be hoping Netanyahu opens a copy of The Australian while he’s here; our PM has criticised the United Nations over the body’s resolutions on Israel, writing: “My government will not support one-sided resolutions criticising Israel of the kind recently adopted by the UN Security Council and we deplore the boycott campaigns designed to delegitimise the Jewish state.” Sydney: Fairfax will release its half-yearly financial results this morning, after the company went in to a trading halt yesterday in preparation for an announcement today about real estate arm Domain. The move to sell off Domain has been received well by some major investors, the Oz reports (“Wait, didn’t you say this yesterday?” I hear you asking. Yes I did — I was just too keen and went a day early. Sometimes you can love reporting season too much.) Washington: Foreign Minister Julie Bishop will meet with Vice President Mike Pence. Sydney: Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe will address the Australia-Canada Economic Leadership Forum. Sydney: Woolworths and Coca-Cola Amatil are among companies releasing their hair-yearly financial results. Adelaide: Final T20 between Australia and Sri Lanka. Welcome, Mr Netanyahu: the first Israeli PM to visit Australia — Malcolm Turnbull (The Australian $): “Israel is a miraculous nation. It has flourished despite invasion, conflict and an almost complete lack of natural resources, other than the determination and genius of its people.” A real friend of Israel would stand up for Palestinian rights — Stuart Rees (The Age): “The Australian and Israeli governments have much in common. Each seems determined to not care much for international law and to care even less about the suffering of Palestinians.” The difference between Malcolm Turnbull and Justin Trudeau — Jennifer Hewett (Australian Financial Review $): “Despite the same loss of manufacturing jobs, sluggish growth, growing deficits and a resource-based economy, Trudeau remains popular – if with a few more dints on his shiny image.” We need to stamp out ‘tanking’ in business — Andrew Leigh (The Age): “The spread of phoenix activity throughout Australia hurts decent small businesses. It hurts the people who worked for the failed company and the suppliers and subcontractors who worked with them. It also hurts honest taxpayers, who have to shell out more when some people don’t pay their fair share.” The Department of Homeland Security has released the first details on how Donald Trump‘s anti-immigration positions will be converted into public policy. Undocumented immigrants with any criminal conviction will now be prioritised for removal, as will those who have been in the country for less than two years. Previously, only serious criminals had been prioritised for removal. Trump has spoken out against anti-Semitism today after failing to mention Jews in remarks on International Holocaust Day and berating a reporter from a Jewish newspaper who tried to ask a question about anti-Semitism. Trump said recent anti-Semitic threats targeting Jewish community centres were “a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil”. The CIA has temporarily suspended support to a number of rebel groups in Syria. The decision came in the wake of Islamist attacks on rebel groups in the northwest of the country and is thought to have been caused by concerns that weapons and ammunition could fall into the wrong hands. — Reuters An Israeli soldier who was caught on camera shooting an incapacitated Palestinian has received the lightest possible sentence and will serve 18 months in prison. Elor Azaria was charged with manslaughter after he killed an injured Palestinian man who had just stabbed a fellow Israeli soldier. The case has proved highly divisive in Israel, with far-right politicians calling for Azaria to be pardoned. — Haaretz Far-right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has cancelled a meeting with Lebanon’s Grand Mufti after refusing to wear a headscarf. While Le Pen insisted she had not realised she would be asked to wear one in advance, a spokesperson for the Grand Mufti said this was not true. — CNN Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe has marked his 93rd birthday by vowing to cling to power and praising US President Donald Trump. Despite laughing off reports of his poor health the nonagenarian is thought to be grooming his 51-year-old wife, Grace, to succeed him. — The Guardian This century is broken (New York Times): “The 21st century is looking much nastier and bumpier: rising ethnic nationalism, falling faith in democracy, a dissolving world order.” A journey through Assad’s Syria (Spiegel Online): “There is a Syrian saying: If you repeat a lie often enough it becomes the truth. A trip through Syria, accompanied by Bashar Assad‘s minders, shows that the true opinions of many Syrians are hidden behind fear, and that the suffering of the other side is being ignored. It shows that the Assad regime may be able to win the war, but that it is creating little room for reconciliation.” Canada is betting on a universal basic income to help cities gutted by manufacturing job loss (Quartz): “Of all the ideas to pull people out of poverty, one of the more contentious is also the simplest: governments should just hand out monthly checks to the poor, no strings attached. That’s exactly what the Canadian province of Ontario plans to do, and it’s already causing a ruckus.” Trump & the press: a murder-suicide pact (Medium): “Am I giving up on journalism and democracy? No, damnit, not yet. I am giving up on mass media. The internet wounded it; Rupert Murdoch and Donald Trump finally killed it.” The secret U.S. army study that targets Moscow (Politico): “A decade ago, McMaster fought a pitched battle inside the Pentagon for a new concept of warfare to address the threat from Islamist terrorists and insurgents in Afghanistan, Iraq and other trouble spots. Now, his new mission is more focused. Target: Moscow.”  Crikey is able to be independent because of subscriber support.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Angus Taylor will take no questions, the flyer wars have started for Victoria's upcoming state election, and an anatomy of how you wipe $600 million off your value in a single day. Crikey Aug 31, 2018  1 Angus Taylor actually, literally, hides from the media glare; the flyers have started for Victoria’s upcoming state election; and an anatomy of how you wipe out $600 million in a single day. From the Crikey grapevine, the latest tips and rumours… Taylor not energised. With the recent knifing reshuffle, Angus Taylor has just agreed to guzzle from the poisoned chalice of the energy portfolio — or, in typically Scott Morrison ‘hardline conservatism masquerading as folksy common sense’ speak, the “minister for getting electricity prices down“. Taylor gave his first speech as minister yesterday at a small business summit in Sydney, and notably denied he was a climate skeptic. Apparently though, he was not so confident in his few policies that he was willing to answer any questions about them. A tipster at the event told us that, after his speech, he barricaded himself in the ironically named “media room” with all the doors closed for roughly half an hour before ducking out a back door as quick as he could. “Farcical” was how our tipster put it.  Labor’s middle class pitch. The flyers have started to circulate for the upcoming Victorian state election. A tipster sent us through what they were handed by some Labor volunteers earlier this week at the Prahran train station, shilling for their candidate Neil Pharaoh. The seat has swung between Liberal and Labor before the Greens scraped home in 2014. Labor, hoping to claw it back for the first time since 2010 are offering “fairness and a more progressive society”, with an “Australia-first” medical cannabis program, plastic bag bans, and “Australia’s first equality minister” alongside more concrete policy positions like “record mental health investment” and “ambitious renewable energy targets”:  Become a subscriber to get full access to the website, as well as our premium newsletters.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au New documents have been filed in an unfair dismissal case. Emily Watkins Jan 22, 2018 A PR firm being sued for unfair dismissal by former journalist Asher Moses has claimed in its defence that Asher Moses was affected by cannabis when working, and had repeatedly not shown up for work during the required hours. Moses, a former Fairfax technology journalist, filed his claim against M+C Partners with the Federal Court last year, alleging he was sacked after he was diagnosed with depression after his father’s illness and death (which he told his employers about), and that he was forced to sell back his equity in the business for nothing after he was deemed a “bad leaver”. Moses, who was a senior executive in the company, says he told his employers about his mental health diagnosis, and that his role and responsibilities were diminished before he was dismissed. In its defence, filed with the court on Thursday January 18, M+C said Moses had been dismissed because he had breached his contract by not working the required hours in the office, breaking the drug and alcohol policy by going to work while under the influence of cannabis, and that his performance was poor. The company said it had not been informed by Moses of his mental illness including depression, that he’d not told them his cannabis use was related to his grief or mental illness, and that he didn’t pass on any medical evidence of his mental illness.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Good morning, early birds. The National Farmers Federation has called for Australia to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050, and Scott Morrison's signed vaccine deal isn't all it was made out to be. It's the news you need to know, with Chris Woods. Chris Woods Aug 20, 2020 According to The Sydney Morning Herald, the National Farmers Federation has called for Australia to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050, a relatively tame, vague goal adopted by literally every state and territory — along with most developed countries and even fossil fuel companies — but still rejected by the Morrison government. Five years after replacing the carbon price with roughly nothing, the Coalition has again refused to implement any carbon target, with Energy Minister Angus Taylor only saying he is working with the farm sector to reduce emissions but that the government “won’t set a target without a plan”. Elsewhere, The Australian ($) reports that shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers will speak to the Warwick Chamber of Commerce today on both climate change and regional communities. Meanwhile, agriculture spokesperson Joel Fitzgibbon — who after less than a month ago speculating that members of the Labor Environment Action Network had “probably infiltrated the party” — has fretted on a podcast run by business search firm Blenheim Partners that Labor could end up splitting trying to juggle urban and regional bases. PS: This feels like a fine time to remind everyone that the Beyond Zero Emissions’ five year proposal to create 1.8 million jobs could probably help with the recession, regional communities, and next global crisis. PPS: In the first of the 2020-21 season, 9News reports that a bushfire is burning across 160 hectares in Duranbah, along the Pacific Highway near the NSW-Queensland border. At 10.30pm AEST Tuesday, just about every media outlet in Australia had published Scott Morrison’s claim to have signed an agreement with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, one worth hundreds of millions of dollars to mass produce their Oxford vaccine candidate in the event it succeeds. However, as The Monthly explains via industry publication Pharma in Focus, Morrison’s “deal” is in fact a signed letter of intent that, according to an AstraZeneca spokesperson, does not “go into any detail about costs or numbers or anything until [they] have an idea of what the manufacturing capacity is”. According to the ABC, Morrison also walked back comments yesterday indicating any future vaccines would be compulsory — acknowledging that, while there are social programs such as “No Jab, No Pay”, the government “can’t hold someone down and make them take it” — and later promised to roll out any locally-made drugs to Pacific and some South-East Asian countries. PS: For some global context, both the US and the UK have signed agreements with six different vaccine candidates, as has the United Kingdom. According to the ABC, the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services told some meatworks staff at JBS Brooklyn that, despite several infections amongst staff, they could skip the self-isolation period following COVID-19 tests so that the plant could remain partially open. The department has replied that the exemption only applied to workers who were not considered close contacts of infected colleagues and who were not feeling unwell. Elsewhere, The Age reports that new clusters at two hospitals in Melbourne’s south and east are not believed to be linked to a growing outbreak at Frankston Hospital, while the Herald Sun notes that, as Dan Andrews and Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton warn of a decline in testing rates, some clinics are now seeing as few as 20 people a day. PS: According to The Age, the Victorian government yesterday removed a restriction barring Melburnians from driving to local parks and other areas in order to exercise, after Victoria Police reminded residents on Tuesday that they faced $1652 fines if found to breach the blatantly nonsensical rule. The Federal Court has dismissed an application to stop Home Affairs from transferring a 68-year-old man with underlying health issues from a Melbourne detention facility to Perth, after first ruling that the government must stop detaining him within the city’s COVID-19 outbreak. Rather than simply letting the man stay with his Melbourne family, Home Affairs intends to fly him to the Yongah Hill Immigration Detention Centre, located an hour outside of Perth — a transfer the Human Rights Law Centre explains has been deemed permissible on the basis that prevention measures be put in place, such as masks, gloves and social distancing. PS: In a separate, damning update on Australian incarceration policy, The Guardian reports that Western Australia has set up a new prison taskforce following the fourth Aboriginal death in jail in three months. We regulate aged care, but when there is a public health pandemic, then public health … whether it gets into aged care, shopping centres, schools or anywhere else, then they are things that are matters for Victoria. So I don’t think it’s as binary as you suggest.  Scott Morrison The prime minister attempts to share responsibility for aged care failures, and, while the Commonwealth is responsible for funding and regulating the sector, he’s not wrong that states can have a role: of the 2000 cases linked to the sector, only five are in Victorian government-run homes, which, coincidentally, are the only ones subject to legislated staff-to-client ratios. Jason Murphy Aug 19, 2020  9 “Australian shoppers — and politicians — may be about to get a very unpleasant cost-of-living shock. “Coles supermarkets just reported its official results and buried below its impressive $930 million profit is some bad news: grocery prices are rising again — faster than official inflation and faster than wages.” Amber Schultz Aug 19, 2020  7 “Cannabis is the COVID-19 drug of choice in Australia after alcohol. Self-reported usage rates have soared and medicinal cannabis approvals are at record rates, increasing by almost 40% since telehealth was implemented in April. “Australians are turning to marijuana during the pandemic for prescribed medication, self-medication, and as an alternative to other substances.” Guy Rundle Aug 19, 2020  50 “The Australian response to the coronavirus should be, by any rational assessment, a cause for pride. We’re not a boutique little island like New Zealand. We’re a continent nation with two major global travel hubs in Melbourne and Sydney. “Had we had a fully anti-science populist prime minister — i.e. the one we will have, gifted by Murdoch, in 10 years — or a couple of premiers of the same stripe, disaster would have been possible.” Embassy job cuts ‘hamstring our consular muscle’ ($) ‘Desperate’ Australian hotels want overseas passenger caps raised to fill quarantine rooms ‘What are you planning to say?’ Pope quizzed whistleblower priest, book claims Frydenberg snubs China Mengniu’s $600m dairy deal for Lion ($) Banjima people caught up in BHP’s Pilbara mine expansion say they were forced to ‘trade away’ heritage $1b NT gas pipeline plan for east coast gas supply ($) Apple’s market value doubles in two years, becoming first US company to top $US2 trillion Australian home affairs department blunder reveals whistleblower’s identity and disclosure details Coronavirus updates: India records deadliest day, Iran death toll tops 20,000 US to roll out rarely-used diplomatic line of attack to reimpose Iran sanctions Weird scenes from the Democratic convention — world waits for the real Joe Biden ($) — Greg Sheridan (The Australian): “The unbelievably weird second night of the Democratic National Convention had four stars — Donald Trump, COVID-19, Jill Biden and a terminally schmaltzy version of Joe Biden’s personal story. This was the Instagram convention. A near vertigo-inducing series of amateur videos paired with an almost complete lack of spontaneity, substance and even rationality.” Local government needs a voice at the national cabinet — Andrew Giles (The Mandarin): “It’s almost a cliché’ to say the challenges we face today are unprecedented. But it makes this no less true. The challenges we face as policymakers and elected officials are enormous. How we respond to the challenges of a pandemic and a deep recession, in particular how we craft policy to make our cities and suburbs better, healthier, more liveable and productive places.” Coronavirus vaccine: Truth behind Scott Morrison’s ‘No Jab, No Pay’ policy — Samantha Maiden (news.com.au): “Scott Morrison was in a strop. It was a Friday — February 20, 2015 — and the Productivity Commission had just released a report into childcare. He had reluctantly agreed to be interviewed about the report in his capacity as social services minister by News Corp Australia’s Sunday newspapers. Recently appointed to the role after ‘stopping the boats’, he was, by all accounts, not impressed with his new job and regarded it as a sideways move.”  Australia Labor leader Anthony Albanese will speak in conversation with Crikey’s editor-in-chief Peter Fray and politics editor Bernard Keane tonight at 6pm AEST.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Good morning, early birds. Victorian MP Helen Haines has challenged politicians to reveal all donors who contribute over $1000 to their campaigns, and $47.9 million worth of grants were reportedly approved against the recommendations of the department when Peter Dutton was home affairs minister. It's the news you need to know, with Emma Elsworthy. Emma Elsworthy Feb 16, 2022  5 Reveal who donates more than a grand to your campaign — that’s the challenge from Victorian MP Helen Haines, The Age reports, as the fallout over donations from coal millionaire John Kinghorn to independent MP Zali Steggall continues. Haines says she’ll list every donation above $1000 on her website each quarter, and anything above the official threshold of $14,500 within just five days (!), demanding all sides of Parliament do likewise. At the moment donations are revealed eight months after the end of the financial year. Speaking of, Steggall this morning has actually pointed the finger at Damien Hodgkinson, her former financial controller, over the donation bungle that saw a $100,000 cheque from Kinghorn not initially disclosed, as The Australian ($) continues. Hodgkinson is actually the director of Simon Holmes à Court’s Climate 200 campaign — and Climate 200 reportedly backed Steggall this week amid the drama. Steggall says she and the Warringah Independents board weren’t involved with the cheque, saying the “donation processing and accounting” was Hodgkinson’s job. It remains to be seen whether the bungle means Steggall’s job is untenable. Speaking of — the Morrison government still has not decided whether to dump stood-aside education minister Alan Tudge, the AFR reports. Rachelle Miller, a former staffer who had a consensual affair with Tudge, alleged he was abusive and once violent. Tudge denies it. An independent investigator (who incidentally also looked into allegations against former High Court judge Dyson Heydon) gave the Tudge report to Prime Minister Scott Morrison on January 28, The New Daily reports. So where is it? Good question — Morrison says he supports the release of it, but no word on the date — or the fate of Tudge — yet. The education minister says he intends to recontest his Victorian seat of Aston at the federal election. When Peter Dutton was home affairs minister, some 225 funding grants (worth $47.9 million) were approved against the recommendations of the department, the auditor-general reportedly found. Why? The audit cited the influence of lobbying MPs and senators, Guardian Australia reports. Of those 23 projects (worth a combined $7 million) were “assessed as either ineligible or unsuitable”. It’s the finding of the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) which looked into the $187 million safer communities grant program, and also found Dutton was more likely to approve grants in Coalition-held seats, ABC continues. But Dutton says funding was fairly neatly split across Labor and the Coalition electorates (about 51.45% to 48.55%), and the auditor-general found mostly there was no clear electoral bias. Also this morning Prime Minister Scott Morrison is reportedly urging Coalition colleagues to show how different they are from Labor, Guardian Australia reports. It comes as Morrison turned to the character test bill to corner the opposition on national security during the final sitting weeks of Parliament — basically at the moment if a non-citizen gets more than 12 months in jail, they are kicked out of the country. It mostly affects New Zealanders, and NZ PM Jacinda Ardern has before slammed the bill, as ABC reports, saying offenders can be born in New Zealand but have not lived there all their lives. Morrison reportedly told MPs to play up “the starkness of the choice in front of the Australian people”, continuing “I know how to do that, and I know that is how you win elections. I know what the path is and I’ll be following it”. Tennis player Novak “no-vax” Djokovic has hit the headlines again after saying he’s willing to forego possibly being the best male tennis player in the world rather than be forced to have a COVID vaccine. Djokovic told a rather incredulous BBC sports journalist he’s willing to miss Wimbledon and the French Open over it, continuing that he was “prepared” not to go to Australia. Djokovic rejected the Australian government’s reasoning for deporting him but distanced himself from the anti-vax movement, Guardian Australia continues. Closer to home, a Western Australian MP has been banned from Parliament after she refused to show either her vaccination status or an exemption, WA Today reports. Legalise Cannabis MP Sophia Moermond slammed her suspension as “medical apartheid” after the was told to go on Tuesday, The New Daily reports. The rule actually only just changed on Tuesday — before then, politicians in WA only had to show their status if there was a lockdown, but an upper house vote made it enforceable all the time. Moermond went on about the vaccine being “unsafe” (there have been 51.1 million doses of vaccine given so far in Australia, and 11 deaths linked to vaccination, a rate of 0.000022%, whereas unvaccinated people are 14 times more likely to die from COVID). Her comments come as hundreds of anti-mandate protesters marched through Perth, The West ($) continues, with one man dressed as former US president Donald Trump and another in a “Make Australia Great Again” cap. One Nation leader Pauline Hanson “called in” via video link to show support, saying she was sick of “nanny states”. Meanwhile in Queensland, a teacher and some prison guards have joined police staff and health workers on 10 legal challenges about vaccination at work, The Brisbane Times reports. In the sunshine state all healthcare workers had to receive two doses by mid-December, while cops had to get both by January 23. Four of the vaccine mandate challenges will have civil trials in April in the Brisbane Supreme Court. Former Australian of the Year and victims of sexual assault advocate Grace Tame had more than a few people sniggering when she responded to a photo of her apparently sitting near a bong in 2014, when Tame was 19 years old. Media heavyweight Lisa Wilkinson described the photo’s backlash as a “relentless hit job” — the Coalition denies they had anything to do with it — while ABC journalist Patricia Karvelas called the outrage “disgusting” and “gross”. Tame had the last laugh when she tweeted a humorous “explanation” for the photo: “Alright, I confess, we were doing a cover of ‘April Sun in Cuba’. On the oboe,” she wrote, an apparent reference to Prime Minister Scott Morrison causing ears to bleed around the country when he strummed a rendition of the 1970s Dragon hit on a ukulele in a 60 Minutes interview that aired on Sunday night. Unsurprisingly, Tame’s photo got a lot more flack than other, far more powerful figures admitting much more than the old photo implied. Former PM Malcolm Turnbull revealed on national TV that he’s “smoked pot”, ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr once ate a pot brownie, and the literal ACT Police Minister Mick Gentleman says he smoked weed in the ’70s. Besides, cannabis is legal in 18 US states, throughout Canada, and in South Africa — as well as our very own ACT. Wishing you a smooth and relaxed Wednesday dudes. I’ve been deposed as leader of the Liberal Party trust by the right wing of the party, working with right-wing media … which is basically in coalition with the Liberal and National parties and government, and their MO [modus operandi] is one of a terrorist. But what they basically do is say: ‘Unless you give us what we want we will blow the joint up’.  Malcolm Turnbull The former PM held nothing back when he seemed to compare News Corp with, well, a terrorist organisation — though Turnbull did not name News Corp specifically, the behemoth’s boss Rupert Murdoch has long been accused of instructing his newspaper editors about their coverage to sway elections. Amber Schultz Feb 15, 2022  13 “Employment Minister Stuart Robert’s inability or unwillingness to disclose key financial details means he should be treated in the same way as former attorney-general Christian Porter who resigned last year over the operation of a blind trust set up to accept donations for his defamation proceedings against the ABC, Senate estimates has heard. “A Crikey investigation into Robert’s blind trust and investments raised a series of unanswered questions about the minister’s financial dealings, Labor Senator Murray Watt said. He asked Trade Minister Simon Birmingham why Robert had not met the same fate as Porter.” Margot Saville Feb 15, 2022  19 “There’s no greater interview subject than a former prime minister with an axe to grind, and Malcolm Turnbull proved that last night with a star turn on the talkfest organised by the Community Independents Project. “The project, run by the former independent member for Indi Cathy McGowan, had invited the Statler and Waldorf of Australian politics — Turnbull and his Queensland mate Kevin Rudd — to opine on media and democracy … it was Turnbull who really let fly on a few topics, including the character of the current PM.” Amber Schultz Feb 15, 2022 “As previously revealed by Crikey, a huge number of people with disabilities show up to the AAT without legal representation — 20% in 2019-20. Ninety-eight per cent of NDIS matters didn’t go to a tribunal hearing, with cases dropped or settled after meeting with legal representatives of the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA). “Meanwhile, the NDIA throws money at external legal firms, while also using its team of in-house lawyers. Freedom of information documents show that across 2020-21 the NDIA paid $17.3 million to legal firms representing external legal matters — an increase of 30% from the previous financial year.” Russia says some troops pulling back from Ukraine border but exercises continue (The Wall Street Journal) ($) German broadcaster Deutsche Welle fires two more Arab employees (Al Jazeera) Prince Andrew settles sexual abuse lawsuit with Virginia Giuffre (The New York Times) Several dead after Spanish trawler sinks off Canada (Al Jazeera) [Russian opposition leader] Alexei Navalny faces 15 more years in prison as new trial starts (The Guardian) Sandy Hook families reach $73m settlement with gun manufacturer Remington (CNN) Stocks rebound after Russia says it will withdraw some troops from Ukraine’s border. (The New York Times) Who is who at the Convoy 2022 occupation of [New Zealand] Parliament’s grounds (Stuff) The [Canadian] federal government has invoked the Emergencies Act. Here’s what that means (CBC) Bunbury, WA — just one of Australia’s many places named after the killers of Indigenous people — Paul Daley (The Guardian): “Perth historian Chris Owen recently focused on WA’s third-largest city — situated on Noongar Wardandi country — in a recent post on his Darkest West Australia page, where he routinely chronicles the state’s shocking pre- and postcolonial violence against Indigenous people. Bunbury is named after Colonel Henry William St Pierre Bunbury, a British army officer who arrived in the colony in March 1836 and who, in just a year-and-a-half, earned a reputation as one of the harshest proponents of colonial ‘justice’ (a genteel euphemism for ‘killing’) in the history of the place. “Bunbury wrote in his journal that the country wasn’t much to his liking, but ‘the Natives seem inclined to be quiet since I shot a few of them one night’ … It is equally clear that Stirling’s reference to adherence to ‘the law’ when it came to his intent to ‘tranquilise’ (another quaint euphemism) the Indigenous warriors (and their non-combatant families) was nothing but a charade. Theoretically, according to English law, the Indigenous custodians of the land upon which the WA colony was imposed were British subjects and, consequently, subject to — and protected by — imperial law.” The joy of cooking (insects) — Tala Schlossberg, Kirk Semple and Jonah M. Kessel (The New York Times): “Mealworm soup. Chile-lime cricket tacos. Charred avocado tartare with ant larvae. In the West, edible insects have long been the domain of food adventurers, with few other takers — even as billions of people elsewhere on the planet count insects as a part of their traditional diets … It’s a matter of numbers. The world’s population is booming. So, too, is agricultural production to meet the growing demand for food. Yet agriculture, particularly the production of meat, is a big driver of environmental harm. “Scientists have warned that unless we make major adjustments to the kinds of food we eat and how we produce it, we have no chance of meeting our climate goals. A change in dietary patterns, especially reduced demand for meat, would help relieve pressure on the environment and mitigate global warming. That’s where insects come in. Though the research is still nascent, the early evidence suggests that some edible insects offer a more environmentally sustainable alternative to some conventional livestock. Insects also offer tremendous potential as pet food and a feed source for conventional livestock.”  Online The Wheeler Centre presents an interactive series about an imagined climate crisis led by storyteller Bernard Caleo.

Melissa Sweet Dec 16, 2015  5 Clearly the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook is not primarily focused on trying to improve the nation’s health or healthcare. If it were, it would look quite different to the document released yesterday. For the health, aged care and welfare sectors, most of the focus is on yet more cuts — to the tune of $3.7 billion, according to the ABC’s calculations (though of course these are described in the MYEFO papers as “savings”).

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Good morning, early birds. New research shows immense concern over climate change, and support for banning coal mines. Plus, insurance sales culture revealed. It's the news you need to know, with Chris Woods. Chris Woods Sep 12, 2018 Research by progressive think tank The Australia Institute has found national concern over climate change has surged and roughly half of Australians want a ban on new coal mines. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that the research, to be officially released later today, found 73% of Australians are concerned about climate change, up from 66% last year, and 49% support banning new coal mines with just 20% opposing. This comes days after Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed the government would abandon emissions targets, and is at odds with the actions of new Energy Minister Angus Taylor as he explores extending the life of coal power. In other news, a new agricultural forecast report has found that NSW winter crops will be down 46% from last year due to the eastern drought, while the Victorian government yesterday announced three new solar and three wind farms, to a combined 928 megawatts, as a result of its first reverse auction. The banking royal commission has heard that trips to Bali, Vespa scooters and “cash money” were among prizes used to incentivise insurance call centres staff to exceed sales targets. The ABC reports that day two of the inquiry found that incentives fuelled an aggressive sales culture in the accidental death and injury insurance company Freedom Insurance. In one of the more shocking examples, a sales agent sold several insurance policies to a 26-year-old man with Down syndrome after an unsolicited sales call which left him “distressed”. Freedom Insurance chief operating officer Craig Orton described the calls as “deeply troubling” and said they “do not make for comfortable listening”. The Department of Home Affairs has reportedly spent tens of thousands of dollars on motivational speeches from celebrities such as singer Casey Donovan, surfer Layne Beachley and Shark Tank judge Naomi Simson. The Daily Telegraph ($) reports that in 2018 alone the department spent more than $63,000 on just five speakers, including $11,250 for a National Reconciliation Week address from Donovan and $13,200 for an “innovation month” speech from celebrity scientist Dr Karl Kruszelnicki. The news drops as an incredible war of words between Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton and former Border Force chief Roman Quaedvlieg continues to escalate, with Quaedvlieg last night complaining to speaker Tony Smith over Dutton’s use of parliamentary privilege to accuse the former colleague of “grooming” a younger woman. Open a history book motherfucker and then go fuck yourself @TheCalebBond.  Kathy Griffin The American comedian dunks on Adelaide teen columnist Caleb Bond for defending a racist cartoon. “As Scott Morrison explained last week, mateship is crucial to his conception of government. ‘Remember, my value is: we look after our mates’. And not really ‘mates’ in the more modern, graciously inclusive, non-gendered sense; this is a boys’ club government, with Scott and Josh, and Mathias and Birmo in the Senate, all top blokes, of course, with Julie Bishop gone to the backbench and complainers like Julia Banks told to harden up and ‘roll with the punches’. Morrison is less Prime Minister than First Mate, Primus Inter Amicis.” “The wires that once linked human traffic to the busiest city intersections were cut, but not by an authoritarian state. We walkers of the world were stripped of our will by maths. And, a good thing, too. A system of traffic must not concede its flow to me, or to anyone running late for a haircut. If we want fair and virtuous systems, we can’t rely on us. We automate the virtue into the systems we inhabit. We build that virtue in.” “In just under three years, Myanmar’s 1991 Nobel Prize Laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi has gone from triumphant former political prisoner — feted around the globe as Southeast Asia’s Nelson Mandela — to her country’s de-facto leader (or is she?) and a spectacular disappointment to those same supporters.” Two Aboriginal teens drown in inner city police chase Tony Abbott set for the long-term as he cements his hold on seat Bid to strip rort doctors’ cars, houses ($) Moreton Bay council secretly helped mayor’s donor win $20 million deal Four-year-old girl from East Devonport is eighth case of meningococcal in Tasmania ($) Short-stay accommodation boom yet to reach peak in Tasmania, inquiry hears Four years on, William Tyrrell disappearance referred to State Coroner WaveStone’s Catherine Allfrey on the day the GFC arrived in Australia ($) Prime Minister Scott Morrison has moved to lift aged care standards to prevent another Oakden tragedy ($) Bob Woodward: ‘People need to wake up’ to what’s happening under Trump ‘Easy-peasy, smash 400 lives by lunchtime’: cold-call victims didn’t stand a chance — Adele Ferguson (Sydney Morning Herald): “It is hard to know what is more distressing, listening to a Freedom Insurance sales representative relentlessly flogging funeral, accidental death and accidental injury insurance to a 26-year-old with Down syndrome, or reading emails bribing sales agents to ‘smash 400 lives’ by lunchtime.” The Herald Sun’s Serena Williams cartoon draws on a long and damaging history of racist caricature — Clare Corbould (The Conversation): “In the United States, the tradition of racist caricature began as slavery came to end. This was not a coincidence. The first place to outlaw slavery in the newly formed United States was Vermont in 1777. Over the next 50 years, northern states abolished slavery at different rates. Then, in 1861, the nation went to war over slavery, and with the Union’s victory four years later, this dark period of the nation’s history officially came to a close.” Northern Australia can benefit from water development boom ($) — Michael McCormack (The NT News): “Water is the lifeblood which empowers regional communities throughout Australia to make a significant contribution to our nation. I’ve never shied away from the fact we should store more of our water and build more dams to use for irrigated agriculture, flood mitigation and to help drought proof our productive primary production regions.”  Canberra Directions hearing for Australian spy-turned-whistleblower Witness K and his lawyer Bernard Collaery, who are facing criminal charges after revealing the 2004 spy operation on East Timor.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au You could argue that Indigenous health is our most important issue. So why isn't the media picking up on it? asks Dr Ruth Armstrong.  Crikey May 27, 2009  1 As a medical journal editor, I don’t measure my success by the amount of general press coverage the articles I shepherd to publication receive. I long ago accepted that the priorities of academic publishing rarely mesh with those of the media. In fact, media coverage of content can be a medical editor’s nightmare, such as a recent instance covered by the ABC’s Media Watch, when an article discussing management options for a child with severe obesity that had been carefully vetted with peer review, thoughtfully revised by the authors and scrupulously edited in-house — all over a period of months — was wildly sensationalised, misused and misquoted by the media. Items from the MJA generally hit the news within the first couple of days of publication. Despite my mixed feelings, I kept an eye out last week for reports about the articles in our latest issue, a theme issue dedicated to Indigenous health.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says he would have signed up to the AUKUS deal with the US and UK if he had been PM at the time, and he has asked Opposition Leader Peter Dutton just what will it take to get his support for an Indigenous Voice to Parliament. Emma Elsworthy Feb 02, 2023  2 Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says he would’ve signed up to AUKUS had he been leader at the time, Guardian Australia reports, despite calls from former Labor PM Paul Keating to walk away. The diplomatic ménage à trois is not just about nuclear submarines, Albo continued — it’s a defence pact between “friends” in an “insecure world”. Incidentally, Defence Minister Richard Marles and Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong will meet with their British counterparts today before Marles heads to the US — it’s prep work for the revelations next month about how exactly we will get to own at least eight subs. It comes as the British navy is urgently investigating whether someone repaired one of its nuclear submarines with superglue, the BBC reports, which honestly sounds like a Monty Python skit. Meanwhile Albanese has written to Opposition Leader Peter Dutton asking him just what it’s gonna take to get his support on the Voice to Parliament, the SMH reports. Albanese asked Dutton for “practical suggestions or amendments on the wording” and reinforced that it’s up to Parliament to decide the structure if the referendum is successful. Dutton is meeting with the referendum working group today, with members Pat Anderson, Megan Davis and Noel Pearson to explain to Dutton how important the Voice really is. So what’s Dutton’s problem? One is how far-reaching the Voice would be — could it have a say in defence matters or budgetary priorities, he wondered on 3AW last month. But Albo wrote in his letter it would offer advice on Indigenous policy — for example, when the alcohol bans in a bunch of Indigenous communities in the NT were suddenly lifted without consultation, as the ABC reported last year. Former Liberal staffer Bruce Lehrmann has lodged an explosive formal complaint against the ACT’s top prosecutor, accusing him of “malice” and “political interests”, The Australian ($) reports. Lehrmann says Director of Public Prosecutions Shane Drumgold’s “public behaviour continues to smear my name and the presumption of innocence that is a cornerstone of our justice system and that demands him to uphold”, news.com.au continues. He also accused Drumgold of “repeatedly and frequently” failing to ensure a fair trial following Brittany Higgins’s allegation of rape. The trial was ultimately abandoned over concerns for Higgins’ health. The ACT government has confirmed the inquiry (the territory’s version of a royal commission) into Lehrmann’s trial can look at political interference in the case, the ABC reports. The inquiry is also looking into why a letter between Drumgold and the ACT’s top cop was made public — in it, Drumgold said detectives had “cherry-picked” evidence and pressured him not to charge Lehrmann. Hey, to another court case now and one of 14 mostly “grey-haired” climate activists who allegedly disrupted Queensland Parliament last year says she’d rather die in jail than a nursing home, Guardian Australia reports. The crew were released on bail under the condition they do not enter Parliament — the case will resume in two weeks. The number of people who put off going to the doctor because it’s too expensive surged by almost 50% in the past 12 months, a damning new report has revealed, amounting to 3.5% of the population, or about one in every 28 people. It’s one of several grim findings in the latest Productivity Commission report, as the ABC reports. Another was that almost a quarter of respondents delayed going to a psychologist, psychiatrist or mental health professional because of money worries. Another finding: 3 million Australians went to the emergency department instead of the GP, the AFR reports, because of expense or wait times. Health Minister Mark Butler put it plainly: “It has never been harder to see a doctor than it is right now. It’s also never been more expensive.” It’s good timing — the premiers will meet with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese tomorrow and are expected to beg for more hospital funding from the Commonwealth. Australian Medical Association vice-president Danielle McMullen said it should be 50-50 state-federal for good, as the AFR reports — that was a temporary hospital funding split during the pandemic. At least we can rest easy about the tiny-yet-dangerous radioactive capsule lost on an enormous stretch of highway between Perth and Pilbara — it has been found. It was like finding a “needle in a haystack”, WA Emergency Services Minister Stephen Dawson said in a story that has gone around the world. “Nothing fans the fires of romance like a ticking clock,” The Guardian’s Clem Bastow says wisely, and she knows that now. On her first trip overseas at 31, not so much. She’d just completed a short course in London when a handsome Scot bailed her up at the pub bleating about a cryptic crossword. Her friends “looked on in dismay” as Cupid fired his arrow, she says. After some deeply romantic make-outs next to some supermarket’s bins, she was certain: he was the one. So what that his housemate did a wee in the kettle, she reasoned. Who cares that he seemed to survive on a diet of gruel? Big deal that he was an acquaintance of dishevelled rocker Pete Doherty! Bastow’s return to her home in Los Angeles only intensified things: late-night video chatting, exchanging playlists. She couldn’t wait to get back to London. After she landed, he didn’t reply to her texts. Hmm, she began to wonder, perhaps I have been too quick here. When she finally teed up a time to meet her handsome Scot, she was met instead with a “waterlogged figure [who] scurried in the side door” and “attempted to dry his beard with a tea towel and explained he’d had to sell his umbrella”. Hmmmm, she continued to wonder. As they talked, she realised it had been nothing more than a spark caused by a dank alleyway and an impending flight. “Overcome with relief, I started laughing and could not stop,” she says. As they left, Bastow spotted a Starbucks. “Well, this is me!” she declared brightly, and hid behind a rack of mugs. He didn’t follow. The lesson? Avoid Scots who sell umbrellas — and stay clear-eyed, even in the romantic throes of an overseas adventure. Hoping the smiles come easily today folks. It just had not crossed my mind until I read it in the newspaper, I think following the Federal Court case.  Alan Tudge Whether or not the robodebt scheme was legal did not occur to the former Coalition human services minister, who was responsible for the illegal welfare crackdown for two solid years. He’s been accused of releasing details of the people who complained about robodebt to the media. David Hardaker Feb 01, 2023  14 “In 1996, Pell’s influence was decidedly on the rise. He was appointed archbishop of Melbourne, having served as a parish priest and bishop for the southern region of Melbourne. His elevation to genuine church power coincided with the election of the Howard government. “He was invited as a delegate to the Australian Constitutional Convention in 1998 to consider the issue of the republic. In 2003 he received the Centenary Medal from the Australian government. Two years later he was made a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC), the highest of Australia’s honours. In the meantime, the Victorian-born Pell had been appointed archbishop of Sydney.” John Buckley Feb 01, 2023  69 “Miller said Tudge requested the files of ‘every single person’ who appeared in news reports on the scheme so ‘we could understand the details of their case’. The bolstered media strategy included ‘correcting the record’ in instances where victims had gone to media with their stories and made claims the department and the minister’s office deemed incorrect. “She was asked about the process that led to the release of victims’ personal details. The commission heard that Miller discussed the partial release of information against the recipient with Bevan Hannan, her media counterpart at the department, and chief counsel Annette Musolino, who cleared the release, which only drew more criticism.” Anton Nilsson Jan 31, 2023  25 “The Greens commissioned the PBO [Parliamentary Budget Office] to calculate how much money Australia could make by legalising cannabis for adults. Shoebridge said a combination of GST, company tax and a 15% cannabis sales tax would add up to more than $28 billion in government revenue in the first decade after legalisation. If the cannabis tax was set at 25% instead, the revenue would be more than $36 billion. “The PBO’s analysis, seen by Crikey, also said the pre-taxed price of cannabis, which is currently estimated at $13.40 per gram, would fall to $6.50 within a decade. It also said that the experience in Canada, where weed is legal, showed that more than half of recreational users would begin buying from legal sources within a few years. Within a decade, the proportion of users buying legally would rise to 95%.” Lebanon devalues official exchange rate by 90% (Al Jazeera) NFL great Tom Brady says he is retiring ‘for good’ (Reuters) Inflation in the eurozone fell for third month in a row in January (EuroNews) Revealed: how world’s biggest fossil fuel firms ‘profited in Myanmar after coup’ (The Guardian) Vaccine makers kept $1.4b in prepayments for cancelled COVID shots for the world’s poor (The New York Times) Andrew Tate: influencer’s appeal against detention rejected by Romanian judges (BBC) Why is Australian TV failing to punch through internationally? — Osman Faruqi (The SMH) ($): “The truth is very few of these shows, especially in recent years, have resonated strongly outside of Australia (Heartbreak High, turbocharged by international streamer Netflix, is one obvious exception). Even when they do break through, it tends to be in isolation rather than part of a cohesive and defined genre that tells a particular story about contemporary Australia. One Heartbreak High doesn’t equate to our equivalent of K-drama, in other words. So, what’s going on? Why does it appear as though Australian TV is failing to punch through? And, perhaps most importantly, does it even matter? “Let’s start with the question of why it matters. Audience size, whether local or international, has nothing to do with quality. Some of the best TV shows in the world have won more awards than they’ve had viewers. On the other hand, something as trite and meaningless as The Big Bang Theory was regularly watched by tens of millions of people around the world. But a show resonating outside its home country is about more than getting to brag about viewership figures. It demonstrates that, in a flooded TV landscape, the quality of the production and the uniqueness of the story stands out … Australia has some policies that encourage film and TV production, but they don’t go anywhere near as far [as] those in other comparable countries.” Sunak thinks he is following Thatcher’s union-busting playbook. But he has fatally misread it — Aditya Chakrabortty (The Guardian): “Despite the clichés of a deep-blue ideologue, the longest-serving prime minister of the 20th century obsessed over building public support for her policies. Through the early 1980s, she was sure the electorate, including rank-and-file union members, backed her against the union leaders. ‘Far from proving a political incubus it was one of our strongest appeals to the voters,’ she writes in her memoirs. Forty years ago, her cabinet considered a version of the same law Sunak is ramming through right now — in her case, a ban on strikes in essential services — but ‘the practical difficulties … were immense’ and great pains were taken to present her as wholly sensible. You would never have caught her on camera without a seatbelt. “After four decades, Sunak’s enemy bears no resemblance to the one faced by Thatcher. She kickstarted the process by which the UK ended up with some of the most repressive union laws of any major rich country and with feeble protections on such essentials as sick pay. Put atop an economic model that has been wrecked since 2008, plus more than a decade of austerity, and what do you get? The average British worker stuck in the longest wage freeze for 200 years. That is the reality of today’s workforce: not a platoon of mini-Arthur Scargills, but men and women who have spent years holding together failing public services, sacrificing a day’s pay and pension contributions on picket lines — merely to stop sinking further into economic misery.”  Online The University of Oslo’s Eli Skogerbø and Deakin University’s Maria Rae will chat about how Norway’s targeted “press support” subsidies could help Australia get better media diversity, and what Norway could learn from our news media bargaining code with Google and Facebook, in a webinar hosted by the Australia Institute.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Young science researchers are often disadvantaged because funding agencies favour researchers with strong track records. Time to go online, says medical researcher Dr Timothy Moss. Crikey Dec 06, 2012  6  Last week a young US medical researcher from Princeton University successfully crowdsourced US$25,000 to fund a research experiment that will test amphetamines (such as crystal meth) on the brains of mice. Researcher Ethan Perlstein used RocketHub, a crowdsourcing site for scientists and entrepreneurs, to raise the cash. It’s not a lot of money in medical research terms, but Perlstein might just have shown a way forward for Australia’s young research scientists struggling to get funding in difficult times.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Banks are regularly denying financial services to, among others, the legal sex industry. Tony Jaques Sep 23, 2021  18 Given the litany of corporate misbehaviour and illegal activity exposed by the Hayne banking royal commission, it is hard to imagine the banks as arbiters of moral behaviour. But that is what’s revealed in submissions to the independent review of the Australian banking code of practice. The triennial review by Mike Callaghan has been told that business banking and other financial services, including merchant facilities, are systematically denied to lawfully operating industries such as adult entertainment, the legal sex industry, gambling, medical marijuana and firearms. The current banking code chapter on accessibility and inclusivity lists protection against discrimination for vulnerable groups, including the elderly, Indigenous, disabled, migrant and LGBTIQ communities. However, it does not include protection for small businesses, and sex workers and others in the adult industry are officially classified by the ATO, banks and the code not as vulnerable individuals but  as small business operators.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Crikey readers have their say. Crikey Feb 10, 2011  5 Mark Riley vs. Tony Abbott: John Shailer writes: Re. “How shit happened for Tony Abbott” (yesterday, item 2). Any fair-minded Australian should be appalled at Channel 7’s Labor-leaning journalist, Mark Riley, attempting to score cheap political points over a remark by Tony Abbott regarding the tragic death of  Lance Corporal Todd MacKinny, and bringing fresh grief to his widow and family. The Defence Association spokesman supported Abbott and confirmed he was quoted out of context.  At the time the Australian Commander agreed with his remark, and Todd Mackinny’s widow has also supported him. No one has been greater supporter of our troops than Tony, and this is simply gutter journalism at it’s very worst — Channel 7 should be ashamed of itself!  (As should the Herald in inciting the soldier’s father to vent his grief and anger against Tony Abbott) NSW People’s Parliament: Chris O’Mara writes: Re. “A People’s Parliament or a News Ltd experiment?” (yesterday, item 17). It may well be that News Limited are seen to be using the forthcoming State Election as an opportunity to push its self interest and sell more copies of the Tele. What I think News limited have done, very cleverly, is recognise the absolute disgust the voters of NSW have with the Labor government. News Limited have for some months very blatantly, usually on the front page, reflected what the public feel. Is this opportunism for News Limited or is this a local paper doing its job and voicing the concerns of the community? There aren’t too many countries in the world where such freedom to express opinion exists. You only have to look to New Limited’s interests in Fiji for an example of what happens when you speak out against a government that imposes its own set of rules and isn’t answerable to the people. One of the real issues we have in NSW is that the government has a 4 year term. We wouldn’t be in this mess if we have 3 year term for government. Four years is too long between elections for a government to become at best complacent and at worst corrupt. The People’s Parliament is a good initiative and further reflects community feelings of wanting to send a real message to the current government and a warning to the incoming. Australia’s carbon task: Geoff Medley writes: Re. “Any way you look at it, our carbon task just got much harder” (yesterday, item 11). Yesterday’s article by Giles Parkinson, outlines the authors ideas on Australia’s response to human induced climate change.  Interesting indeed! However if Julia Gillard wanted to show some real leadership on the issue she would come out and scrap any idea of a carbon emissions trading scheme in any disguise whatsoever. She would declare that the status quo remains with Australia’s long term reliance on coal fired power generation assured until nuclear could take over.  And she would say to the world that Australia contributes three-fifths of five-eighths of not much as far as world emissions are concerned so the rest of the world can go jump. Now that would show some real leadership! Pakistan: Niall Clugston writes: Re. “Egypt: judicial reckoning looms for Musharraf” (yesterday, item 15). Charles Richardson misrepresents the recent history of Pakistan. Firstly, Pervez Musharraf might have been involved in the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, but it seems unlikely.  The fact is she courted the assassins, by not only making a public appearance (which Musharraf never did) but doing so by travelling slowly along a publicised route.  No security detail could have stopped a competent terrorist squad in those conditions. Secondly, for all the armchair criticism, Pakistan’s forces have captured more high-level “al-Quaeda” operatives than the American-led forces in Afghanistan.  Rather than being “soft” in Richardson’s words, Musharraf was performing a delicate balancing act, trying to avoid pushing hardline Muslims into the terrorist camp. Thirdly, Bhutto’s claims to power were as dynastic as “democratic”, and she was no more “secular” than Musharraf. Fourthly, rather than being Bhutto’s natural enemy, there is no reason why Musharraf could not have been her ally.  After all, his only motive in launching his coup was to prevent his own sacking (and presumably imprisonment or exile). Finally, America’s support to Musharraf wasn’t as a “bulwark against democracy”, but as merely a friendly government.  I doubt America would want to destabilise any Pakistani government that supports their war. Cannabis & schizophrenia: Michael R. James writes: Re. “Why pot really is making kids sick: the new scientific line” (yesterday, item 9). The article by Sophie Cousins was too emphatic in accepting the conclusion from the newly published study. Schizophrenia (SZ) is a terrible disease particularly as it afflicts adolescents and young adults but these strenuous attempts to place blame on a single environmental factor seems misguided. Readers should understand that this paper has not generated new primary data but is instead a meta-study of previously published data. A meta-study attempts to extract analyses of greater statistical significance from as many published studies as can be found to meet specified eligibility criteria. Meta-studies are used when there is confusion or conflicting conclusions from individual studies, usually over a long period of time. They are often employed, or resorted to, when statistical power of individual studies is inadequate. Thus, by definition the hypotheses being tested are not easy to prove and the phenomena being examined are complex and poorly understood. Disease of mental health fit this bill to an extreme. Clearly any attempt to increase power by pooling data from different studies is itself susceptible to problems, perhaps none more so than in mental health research. The meta-study must attempt to establish rules that pool appropriate data and exclude incompatible data. In this case, of 443 relevant published papers examined 354 of them were excluded from the meta-study. So 80% of papers were excluded for the various reasons given by Large et al. For example only those were retained that reported time of onset of psychosis rather than time of first treatment. These exclusions were an attempt to remove potential confounding issues that may have previously hidden significant associations. But excluding 80% of data raises the risk of ascertainment bias or publication bias, notwithstanding the authors’ statement “There was no statistical evidence of publication bias.” Statisticians try to take care of such nuisances but this scientist hardly ever believes their claims. Personally I am not going to be persuaded by studies like this. There are too many other possibilities, for example an ascertainment bias caused by susceptible teens being over-represented in the drug user group (or starting earlier, or smoking more). There are contrary studies suggesting that cannabis use may actually ameliorate psychosocial effects in SZ.  I also find the effect described (cannabis use advances disease onset by 2.7 y) suspiciously high especially since it comes from all users, not, say, high users. The authors reported that heavy use caused a greater effect but was not statistically significantly separable from light users; there is almost the hint in the paper that single use may be enough! More worrying is how enthusiastically politicians and some in the medical profession will grasp onto conclusions like this. Indeed, there is the money to perform these kinds of studies because cannabis is the third most commonly used addictive drug, not because it is the third most harm inducing drug. (That honour will lie with drugs like Prozac or Stilnox and other prescribed behaviour-modifying drugs our society is overdosing itself on.) Like the hysteria over ecstasy (on average one death per year compared to 12,000 alcohol-related deaths (2006 data, all ages) or log orders lower than youth alcohol consumption or dozens of other things kids use or do) the harm from cannabis is self-evidently not easy to find or we wouldn’t need to spend so much research money searching for it. And as a Crikey commenter noted “about 20 people under 25 experience early onset of schizophrenia and have smoked marijuana at least once” are not compelling numbers. Total abstinence is not going to make much difference to SZ prevalence—maybe none if, as is likely, all such people will still suffer SZ a few years later — or have much public health impact at all really. But even if we give the benefit of the doubt to such studies or the hypothesis, I doubt anyone seriously believes the “solution” is more draconian prohibition. And good luck on counseling kids on preventive measures for a disease which less than 1% of them will suffer. If anything these studies suggest that decriminalization and regulation of the product (THC levels etc) would be the way to go.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Evidence from similar drug testing for welfare trials elsewhere in the world suggest it is a solution in need of a problem. Josh Taylor May 10, 2017  16 Evidence from the United States suggests the Turnbull government’s proposal to crack down on people receiving Newstart and Youth Allowance payments by subjecting them to regular drug tests will be ineffective and costly. In last night’s federal budget, the government announced a two-year drug testing trial for 5000 people on Newstart or Youth Allowance. Those who fail the test will be limited in how much cash they can access from their welfare payments, and those who fail a subsequent test will be required to seek medical treatment. The idea had been floated by ex-PM Tony Abbott and his then-social services minister Kevin Andrews but was quickly dropped. Where the scheme has been tried elsewhere in the world, it has not turned up as many drug users as might have been expected. ThinkProgress in 2015 had a look at seven similar programs in states across the United States, and found that while the national drug use rate was 9.7%, the actual positive results for those seeking welfare in the states was mostly lower than 1%, despite collectively spending more than $1 million on the testing. In New Zealand, data from 2015 showed that of the 8001 tests conducted for $1 million, just 22 people tested positive.

Scott Morrison has rejected a proposed United Nations migration compact, researchers have found that just five NSW coal plants lead to several hundred deaths each year, and a plastic-filled whale has been discovered in Indonesia. It's the news you need to know, with Chris Woods. Chris Woods Nov 21, 2018 Prime Minister Scott Morrison will refuse to sign up to the UN Global Compact for Migration, an agreement to ensure a global set of principles for safe migration, arguing that the compact would weaken border security, risk encouraging more people “illegally” seeking asylum by boat, and give ammunition to critics. The Australian ($) reports that Morrison, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton, and Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne will today release a joint statement rejecting the compact on the grounds that Australia has already achieved the stated goals of “safe, orderly and regular migration”. The Coalition, which today faces backlash from both business groups and state governments ($) over plans to drop the migration rate, now joins the US, Hungary, Austria and Czech Republic governments in rejecting the UN document. As the Daily Telegraph ($) notes, the compact would seek limits on detention and, according to Morrison, not “adequately distinguish” between people seeking asylum by boat or land. Dutton further claimed that the government has removed kids in detention, comments made just hours after teachers across the country walked off the job over the 17 remaining child refugees still detained on Nauru and Manus Island alongside hundreds of adults. A new study commissioned by Environmental Justice Australia has found that air pollution from NSW’s five coal-fired power stations has lead to an estimated 279 deaths a year, with thousands more expected in the years leading to their closure. According to The Sydney Morning Herald, the report examined the effects of fine particle pollution by NSW’s plants, many of which have filters but operate without modern control technologies. This leads to the release of secondary particles that most other nations ban, with recorded impacts including 233 low birth-weight babies being born, and 369 people developing type 2 diabetes each year. By the time the last of the five plants is due to shut in 2042, these figures are expected to jump up to 3029 and 4412 respectively. The news comes as Opposition Leader Bill Shorten prepares to unveil Labor’s energy policy tomorrow, which the SMH reports could include a resurrected National Energy Guarantee, plans to bypass parliament for renewable investment mechanisms, energy efficiency measures, a transition package for coal workers and communities, and a version of the ACCC’s “dispatchable” recommendation focused on storage. A dead sperm whale has washed ashore in eastern Indonesia with thongs, bottles, bags, and 115 drinking cups in its stomach. The Guardian reports that Wakatobi national park rangers found the 9.5 metre carcass on Monday in Southeast Sulawesi after being contacted by environmentalists. WWF researchers said the whale’s state of decay made it difficult to cite the lump of garbage, which included over 1000 assorted pieces of plastic, as the cause of death. Temper your sense of justice.  Ian Narev, according to CBA chief Matt Comyn The former Commonwealth Bank chief explains to his successor how to handle those icky feelings over selling largely pointless insurance policies. “Here’s a great idea — why don’t some conservatives get together and start their own version of GetUp to combat the perceived power of the much-demonised progressive activist group? In fact it’s such a great idea, the right keeps having it… over and over and over.” “There was one place you wouldn’t read about legal action launched on Monday against two former Tennis Australia directors. While the story was covered by all the major news websites (including Nine’s news website) and other outlets yesterday, Nine’s Wide World of Sports (WWOS) steered well clear of the yarn.” “Politics is a game of scissors paper rock. Call it numbers screw-up money. Whenever anything bizarre appears, is it numbers, screw-up or money? Screw-up beats numbers (i.e. in-party or electoral support), money beats screw-up, numbers beats money. Round it goes. Whatever your first thought is, it’s the one that beats it that’s likely true.” Visa squeeze on families and skilled workers under Morrison’s population pitch Australian aid groups apologise for sexual abuse and harassment in vulnerable communities MPs’ subpoena powers face test in High Court action ($) Victorian state election 2018: Morrison Government backs Sunshine route for airport rail ($) How China diverts, then spies on Australia’s internet traffic Speaker Sue Hickey votes against Government over birth certificate gender reform, adjourns House Donald Trump’s ban on giving asylum to illegal migrants temporarily blocked by judge Papua New Guinea rejects US criticisms of Chinese ‘Belt and Road’ 190 bottles of wine, 21 cases of beer and a pineapple: Gifts for MP’s interest US asks for our help on North Korea nuclear weapons checks ($) It’s robbing Peta to pay Peta, but still worthwhile — Caitlin Fitzsimmons (Sydney Morning Herald): “Among women over the age of 15, more than one in six (17 per cent) have experienced violence from a current or former partner – equivalent to 1.6 million Australian women. So there is plenty of merit in the proposal to let survivors of domestic violence get early access to their superannuation in the Women’s Economic Security Statement, announced by the Minister for Women, Kelly O’Dwyer. There are also flaws.” Beware of joining US in a cold war that he can’t win ($) — Sam Roggeveen (The Australian): “Then there is the question of America’s resolve. There is not much evidence that the US is readying itself for a contest on this scale. Both Pence and Obama have issued strong words when travelling in Asia, but has US policy in the region matched that language? And has any recent US president delivered a speech to his own people to prepare them for a struggle that could be tougher than the 40-plus year Cold War against Soviet communism?” Scott Morrison’s population pitch may resonate with voters — David Crowe (Sydney Morning Herald): “Nobody should dismiss the migration debate when Australians have good reason to worry about their crowded cities. The government is yet to take an official decision but Morrison has leapfrogged his ministers. The permanent migration cap is 190,000 a year and should be subject to annual consultation in the weeks ahead. Morrison has made it clear he wants it to be at least 160,000. So much for the consultation.”  Darwin Day one of the two-day OECD meeting of mining regions and cities, with Chief Minister Michael Gunner to deliver a keynote.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Good morning, early birds. A top infectious disease expert has urged Australians to not put off getting COVID-19 vaccinations, and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly announced that his government is “determined to continue this operation until its aim is met”. It's the news you need to know, with Chris Woods. Chris Woods May 20, 2021  1 Top infectious disease expert Professor Sharon Lewin has called on Australians not to put off getting COVID-19 vaccinations, explaining to The Sydney Morning Herald that doctors have learned more about the rare blood-clotting condition linked to the AstraZeneca shot and are beginning to see milder cases. At the same time, Guardian Australia reports that more than 1.5 million shots — or about one in every four distributed — are now sitting unused in clinics across the country. Scott Morrison yesterday declared he was “not overly troubled” by a new survey in the Nine papers suggesting almost 30% of Australian adults are unlikely to get immunised, although projections by the Blueprint Institute also show that, going off current vaccination rates, it would take until November 2022 for vaccinations to hit five in six Australians. The news comes amid criticism of the government’s communication strategy and open-ended plan to reopen international borders; the SMH and The New Daily report that several public health experts have called for better communication and a federal advertising campaign, while head of the Australian Medical Association Dr Omar Khorshid has explained that a plan for 2022 would help foster a sense of urgency. Elsewhere, 51-year-old Sunil Khanna has become the third Australian reported to have died of COVID-19 in India, with the ABC noting Khanna passed on April 29 while his elderly mother died a day later. PS: In the latest federal-state divides, The Australian ($) reports Gladys Berejiklian wants an end to internal borders in Australia — putting her at odds with Morrison, who has called for a state version of vaccine passports — while Annastacia Palaszczuk has accused the federal government of “cherry picking” regional quarantine proposals. Benjamin Netanyahu has apparently knocked backed a message from Joe Biden that the US president expects “a significant de-escalation … on the path to a ceasefire” on Wednesday, with Al Jazeera reporting the Israel prime minister announced his government is “determined to continue this operation until its aim is met”. Israeli fighter jets continued to pummel Gaza Wednesday morning, destroying residential buildings and killing at least four people including journalist Yusef Abu Hussein, while a Palestinian protester has been killed and dozens wounded by soldiers in occupied West Bank. Palestinians across both territories and Israel have also engaged in a general strike. Elsewhere, Israel has fired artillery at Lebanese targets in response to four rockets launched from the territory, Reuters notes, while Gaza is now battling water shortage and COVID-19 outbreaks on top of the daily air strikes. In the US, Biden has been booed by hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters during a visit to an electric vehicle plant in Michigan, while The Hill reports that a group of progressive House Democrats led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have introduced a resolution designed to block a US$735 million arms sale to Israel. PS: After Scott Morrison declared last Friday that Israel “unquestionably has the right to defend itself … and, equally, Palestinians need to be able to live safely” — and Foreign Minister Marise Payne and shadow minister Penny Wong called on both sides to stand down — head of the Australian Centre for International Justice Rawan Arraf has argued in an interview with Sydney Criminal Lawyers that the Morrison government “has been the most pro-Israeli government that we have seen in Australian history”. Finally, the Victorian government will today hand down a budget showing a $16.5 billion turnaround from 2020’s debt forecasts — with net debt set to reach $138.3 billion by 2023-24. This is down almost 11% on the $154.8 billion outlined in November’s state budget — which The Australian ($) reports is attributed to a recovery in the property market, increased GST revenue and the creation of 240,000 jobs since September. But Treasurer Tim Pallas has also confirmed figures from a state audit completed last month and says the budget will show cost overruns and time delays averaging 30% across infrastructure projects worth more than $100 million. The Age notes the budget will include an extra $1.37 billion for the Metro Tunnel after it agreed to split the $2.74 billion blowout with the consortium building the project. Pallas also said plans for an extra $2.4 billion in property taxes are not, in the Nine papers’ words, meant to “vilify Victorians who had been successful”, an apparent response to campaigns from property developers as reported in the AFR ($). Elsewhere, The Mandarin reports of a $986 million plan to rollout 25 new energy efficient trains, while the government’s acceptance of all recommendations from its mental health royal commission yesterday signals a potential new mental health levy to fund service improvements. [Doug Cameron, via Twitter]: So Phillip Coorey is running cover for Morrison and his dumb decision to publicly fund a gas fired power station. The compliant RW media will not critically analyse crazy govt decisions. Justifying ideology over the environment is cowardly failure of journalistic integrity. [Phillip Coorey, via text before being tweeted by Cameron]: Hey Doug, the unions, the workers, the bosses and some of your former colleagues say that power station is needed to keep the smelter open and stop AGL and others gouging manufacturers on price and costing jobs. Remember when you used to care about that stuff and didn’t think government intervention was a bad idea when the markets failed the people? You’re a fraud mate.  Doug Cameron and Phillip Coorey Sure, “cons” for the government’s Kurri Kurri gas plant include it being a polluting, costly, and redundant gift to Coalition donors, but we officially have a “pro” after the news inspired this tit-for-tat between a former Labor senator and the AFR’s political editor. David Hardaker May 19, 2021  54 “Nothing says influence quite like having your own member of parliament — in the case of Andrew ‘Twiggy’ Forrest it is WA Liberal Senator Matt O’Sullivan, a Christian politician who appears to have already had an outsize influence on the federal government despite his brief time in Parliament. “O’Sullivan was elected to the senate in 2019 from number-three position on the Liberal ticket having spent the last 10 years of his working life at Forrest’s charitable foundation Minderoo.” Georgia Wilkins May 19, 2021  19 “Has there ever been a project that so neatly fits the government’s political agenda as well as the commercial interests of its mates? “The $600 million subsidy announced for a gas plant in Kurri Kurri makes no commercial sense for the taxpayer, but there are windfalls everywhere you look for Liberal donors. “From the owners of the proposed site through to the Hunter Gas Pipeline and on to the Santos’ Narrabri gas project, there are vested interests as far as the eye can see.” Kishor Napier-Raman May 19, 2021  14 “Penny Wong didn’t want to talk about the book she was there to launch. Labor’s foreign affairs spokeswoman used the release of Red Zone — The Sydney Morning Herald international editor Peter Hartcher’s deep-dive into the growing threat of Xi Jinping’s China — as an opportunity to excoriate the Morrison government’s opportunistic, misguided handling of foreign policy. “Delivering a stump speech which had been dropped to media overnight, Wong lashed out at an approach to China that was often ‘frenzied, afraid and lacking context’.” Liberal staffer accused of raping Brittany Higgins not sacked until 10 days after leaving office Call to limit low-paid wage rises ($) NT government concludes investigation into complaint against Treaty Commissioner Mick Dodson Second safe-injecting room to be modelled on King’s Cross facility Phone records, police documents to be examined in Ben Roberts-Smith defamation case 4 ways to fix private health insurance so it can sustain a growing, ageing population Health and Community Services Union unveils radical proposal to legalise cannabis ($) Ancient Australian Aboriginal memory tool superior to ‘memory palace’ learning ‘Beyond absurd claims’: Australia slams attempts to scuttle free trade deal with Britain Nancy Pelosi calls for ‘diplomatic boycott’ of 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics over human rights Vladimir Putin says Russia-China ties at ‘highest level in history’ during launch of nuclear projects Scott Morrison: pictures do not replace leadership in action ($) — Niki Savva (The Australian): “Amazing pictures of a touring Prime Minister going out of his way to show whoever he is visiting he is one of them guarantee him a run on the news. The poses help tell or sell the story of the day. But they do not count as leadership. That is sort of what Dominic Perrottet, the NSW Treasurer, was getting at when he tried to give the prime minister a big prod to lift his game, or rather his vision, above the polls. More gingerly a clutch of his backbenchers have finally shown signs of life to urge discussion of when and under what circumstances international borders can be reopened.” As a Palestinian and ex-journo, the coverage of Gaza by Aussie media outlets has devastated me — Jennine Khalik (Pedestrian.TV): “I’ve been watching the events unfold, feeling helpless — a helplessness compounded by the poor, biased media coverage from mainstream, commercial Australian media outlets, including those I worked at. This past fortnight, we have all been watching the dispossession of Palestinian homes in Sheikh Jarrah, and when finally the news was reported, after the silence, it was referred to as ‘clashes’. That’s the word used by our media to describe the forced evictions of Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah, Jerusalem, by illegal Israeli settlers and Israeli forces: ‘clashes’.” Government-owned firms like Snowy Hydro can do better than building $600 million gas plants — Arjuna Dibley (The Conversation): “Australian governments (of all persuasions) have not often used the companies they own to lead in clean energy innovation. Many, such as Hydro Tasmania, still rely on decades-old hydroelectric technologies. And others, such as Queensland’s Stanwell Corporation and Western Australia’s Synergy, rely heavily on older coal and gas assets. Asking Snowy Hydro to build a gas-fired power plant is yet another example — but it needn’t be this way.”  Brisbane Sinologist Linda Jaivin will discuss her new book The Shortest History of China in an Avid Reader online event. Australia The Grattan Institute will host webinar event “How to reignite policy reform in Australia” with former public servants Martin Parkinson and Don Russell, as well as inaugural chief executive of the think tank John Daley.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Former ACCC chair Rod Sims says the big gas companies should be bullied into lowering their prices, and the risks of heart disease from two of the COVID vaccines were not known until months after being put into Aussie arms.  Emma Elsworthy Oct 27, 2022 We should threaten the big three gas giants with export limits to get them to lower energy prices for Australian homes and businesses, according to Rod Sims. The former competition watchdog chair says export controls would scare the pants off Origin Energy, AGL and EnergyAustralia, Guardian Australia reports, and besides, they have an “obligation” to provide energy at a good price at home before shipping it all off overseas. Sims reckons the fuel should go for less than $10 a gigajoule domestically, which is less than half this year’s spot prices of more than $20. Would we do it? Hmm. Treasurer Jim Chalmers told the National Press Club he’s looking at a bunch of interventions, and there’s been chatter before about a trigger that would force supply into our local market. If we do nothing, households could be paying an extra $1300 on energy in the next two years, the SMH reports, but Chalmers says it’s just too late to stop the surge in prices we’re living through right now. Here’s what the budget says is coming: a 20% rise in electricity before Christmas and a 20% rise in gas prices before mid next year. To June 2024, a 30% rise in electricity prices and a 20% rise in gas prices. Compounding spits out that 56% overall figure you might’ve seen around. So what’s on the table? A supertax on energy giants to fund a household rebate, and a cap on gas prices — The Australian ($) reports the union told Prime Minister Anthony Albanese that without a price cap, factories would be forced to close — and fast. One thing’s for sure, Chalmers says — any financial support from the government is off the table, the SMH reports, even though NSW Treasurer Matt Kean points out the UK, German and French governments were all providing direct payments to help out households. Our vaccine technical advisory group didn’t know the COVID vaccine posed heart risks until five months after it approved the jab, news.com.au reports. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) revealed the side effect from the Moderna and Pfizer jabs was not known until May 2021, though the heart condition affected only a very small group of people. Interestingly, the risk was lower if you got the AstraZeneca vaccine — which is ironic considering all that drama over the AZ jab last year, as the BBC reports. It comes as Australia’s peak medical bodies are reeling from the Albanese government’s decision to end the shared funding deal between the states and the Commonwealth. It was a COVID-era policy that the budget confirmed would expire on New Year’s Eve, Guardian Australia reports. But the AMA says our hospitals are already at breaking point, and there’s a “very high probability” of another COVID wave before the end of the year. It comes as the budget earmarked $2.6 billion into our ongoing COVID response, the ABC reports, though unlike the UK and US, it failed to allocate a single dollar for long COVID research. Meanwhile in Queensland, a DNA lab manager has told an inquiry he ignored warnings from his team that its testing was misleading the courts, The Courier-Mail ($) reports. The Commission of Inquiry into Forensic DNA Testing in Queensland is examining the state lab’s failure to test thousands of samples correctly. Some say thousands of criminal investigations — including for murder and rape allegations — could’ve been messed up by scientists saying there was no DNA, or not enough DNA, found, The Australian ($) continues. The threshold for DNA, which the inquiry has been told was introduced to save the lab time and money, was scrapped in June when the inquiry kicked off. Former prime minister Scott Morrison’s apology to former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins risked a fair trial, according to the former lawyers of the man accused of sexually assaulting her. Morrison apologised to Higgins in February “for the terrible things that took place here”, saying the Parliament should’ve been a safe place but turned out to be a “nightmare”. The apology was one of the reasons Bruce Lehrmann sought to have his trial halted indefinitely, the SMH reports, as he argued it implied he was guilty before he’d had his day in court. It comes as the jury is continuing to deliberate in Lehrmann’s criminal trial after five days. To another trial now and the Federal Court has ordered the Commonwealth to enter mediation with the Indonesian children who were jailed in adult prisons, the ABC reports. More than 120 Indonesian boys (now men) who were trying to gain entry to Australia via boat were embroiled in the saga — the AFP’s controversial X-ray technique used the wrist bones to assess age, but Australia’s Human Rights Commission found the method was “inherently flawed”. Then attorney-general Christian Porter refused to refer the cases of two young teens to appeal, saying a court “could not reasonably conclude that a miscarriage of justice has occurred”, as Guardian Australia reports, even though six of the eight boys had their convictions overturned by a WA court at the beginning of the year. Staying in WA a moment, Liberal Clan MP Ian Goodenough had reported “forged texts” to police that show him threatening to quit the Liberal Party and sit as an independent, The West ($) reports. The paper had the receipts — it showed him the screengrabs earlier this month, and he retorted that he “fully [denied] sending those messages”. Police are warning businesses in the Northern Territory to watch out for fake $100 notes. The counterfeit currency is identifiable by “subtle differences”, the prim instructions read. For one, there’s a big honkin’ Steve Irwin face on the front. Turn the note over and you’re met with the stern glare of Alf Stewart from Home and Away, lesser known by his actual name Ray Meagher. The unlikely duo replaced Sir John Monash, a war hero and widely respected engineer, and Dame Nellie Melba, one of the most famous singers in the late Victorian era, as The New Daily reports. OK, but what if folks just figured we modernised the moola? The police continue there are other telltale signs one can be on alert for. You know the Shrine of Remembrance? It “is now John Farnham“, the note from the police states frankly. Still, you may be thinking, it wouldn’t be that weird to see the trio of Aussie blokes on our notes. For those who need further instructions on how to spot the counterfeit cash, simply look at whether the word “Australia”, typically written in rich, cursive across the pale green note, is instead spelt “Straylia”. Then you will know for sure you are holding a fake bill, the police say. So where did these patriotic notes come from? They were part of a TV production but were stolen in Alice Springs, though we don’t really know how much was taken — in addition to the $100 Detective Acting Senior Sergeant Robert Kent warned there might be fake $10s, $20s and $50s in circulation. Who will adorn the front and back of those counterfeit notes? The SBS’s Lee Lin Chin? Agro from Agro’s Cartoon Connection? That kid who threw an egg at conservative then senator Fraser Anning’s noggin? We can only wonder. Hoping you can see what’s real today in your world too. Inflation is the dragon we need to slay … But there’s a right way to spend and there’s a wrong way to spend. And perhaps surprising to some was our determination to deliver cost-of-living relief only where it met very specific and very strict criteria.  Jim Chalmers Someone has been enjoying the Game of Thrones prequel, House of the Dragon, it seems. The treasurer made the comments while defending his austere budget, which comes as inflation has jumped to 7.3%. Anton Nilsson Oct 26, 2022  23  “A ‘stunt’ by a freshman Greens MP to force a debate on a supply bill was roundly criticised in Parliament, even uniting the opposition and government, in what one academic says highlights the party’s newfound hubris after the election results. Griffith MP Max Chandler-Mather told Crikey on Wednesday he had no regrets and that the government was feigning ‘faux outrage’ to distract from a set of controversial tax cuts. “The night before, a full hour after the treasurer’s budget speech when most of the chamber had emptied and the MPs left were going through the motions of passing appropriations and supply bills, Chandler-Mather moved to amend a set of bills in order to make a protest speech about the government’s stage three tax cuts.” Guy Rundle Oct 26, 2022  69 “The mood was alternating between edgy and violent, which is very much the mood of the country at the moment. Donald Trump, in a rally in Texas, looked forward to journalists being jailed and raped in prison; the Republican anti-abortion candidates now oppose abortion, even if the mother’s life is at risk; Kanye West is talking about the Jewish cabal, about killing Jews, and has just been dropped by Adidas — which takes some doing; President Biden has warned Russia not to use tactical nuclear weapons, like it was a trade dispute. “On CNN that morning, a story on the sentencing of the Parkland high school mass killer was interrupted by breaking news about a high school shooter in St Louis. The latter killed a teacher and a student before police got him. He left a note saying he was lonely and isolated and had never had a girlfriend. He had also left 600 rounds in 12 magazines as ammo drops around the school he was about to shoot up. On it goes.” Adam Schwab Oct 26, 2022  27  “For lockdowns to have been genuinely effective, regions that refused to take such measures would need to have experienced far higher excess deaths and COVID-related deaths. Perhaps counterintuitively, in many cases, the opposite occurred — with some regions that locked down instead experiencing more excess deaths. The most obvious (but certainly not only) example was oft-criticised Sweden, which took a lighter-touch approach. “Sweden didn’t forcibly shut down non-essential workplaces. Instead, Sweden encouraged people to work from home and closed senior schools and universities (but allowed younger students to continue to attend in-person classes).  Perhaps paradoxically, Sweden suffered fewer excess deaths than many other countries that undertook lengthy lockdowns, including Peru, Italy, the US, Spain, Chile, Britain, the Netherlands, Germany and France.” Attack on Shiraz shrine kills 15: Iranian state media (Al Jazeera) Putin watches first Russian nuclear drill since invasion of Ukraine (BBC) Lebanon begins ‘voluntary’ repatriation of Syrian refugees (Al Jazeera) Atmospheric levels of all three greenhouse gases hit record high (The Guardian) Dubai company eyeing takeover and lease of Ports of Auckland business (NZ Herald) US mortgage interest rates jump to 7.16%, highest since 2001 (Reuters) Germany to legalise possession of up to 30g of cannabis and sale for recreational purposes (EuroNews) Our most pressing economic challenge is soaring power prices, and the government needs simple solutions, fast — David Speers (ABC): “Higher energy costs are also one of the main drivers of inflation, pushing up prices across the economy. According to the budget, higher electricity and gas prices will contribute 0.75% to inflation this financial year and 1% in 2023-24. Without this pressure from power prices, inflation would be considerably lower. Real wage growth would kick in earlier. This is an urgent policy problem for the government, with no sign it’s yet worked out what to do. “The government rightly points out there are factors at play here beyond its control. Energy prices are soaring globally due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. Nor has a decade of shifting domestic policy positions on climate and energy helped. And yet, the notion of an energy exporting super-power like Australia being unable to provide affordable energy at home becomes increasingly difficult to comprehend. As does the confusion over Labor’s pre-election promise (still being made after the war in Ukraine had begun) that power prices would fall by $275 by 2025.” Childcare, leave, housing: where women won in Labor’s first budget — Nicole Pedersen-McKinnon (The SMH): “In a policy already announced, from July next year, a higher income eligibility threshold of $530,000 will lift subsidy rates for 96% of families using childcare. Under $80,000, the refund will be 90% for a first child. The rates are also more generous for subsequent children. The idea of the plan for cheaper childcare is to reduce barriers to women’s workforce participation by making early childhood education more affordable. The cost is $4.7 billion over four years, with the government resisting calls to bring in the changes early, in January, to try and ease the skills and labour shortage. “In a bid to ‘support more equitable distribution of work and care between parents’, $531.6 million over the same four years as above will fund changes to paid parental leave. This, too, was announced ahead of the budget and lets either parent take paid leave that will reach 26 weeks (up from 18 weeks) by July 2026. Currently, the payment goes only to the birth parent with fathers and partners receiving just two weeks’ additionally. From July next year, parents will be able to take the leave in blocks as small as a day at a time. The aim is greater flexibility and promoting more equal distribution of paid and unpaid work in households, the government’s women’s budget statement says. Income testing the payments at a whole-of-family income of $350,000, instead of the individual income test currently set at $156,647, will allow an extra 2200 families to access the scheme and benefit women with incomes above that level who are the primary income earners.”  Online Minister for International Development and the Pacific Pat Conroy will speak at the Australian Council for International Development’s national conference which will explore climate action. Eora Nation Country (also known as Sydney) The New York Times’s Jane Coaston and ABC’s Annabel Crabb will chat about the 2022 US midterm elections, held at the University of Sydney. Former Australian army intelligence analyst Clinton Fernandes will chat about his new book, Sub-imperial Power, in a talk held at Glee Books. Yuggera Country (also known as Brisbane) Ethnographer Paul Memmott will chat about his new book, Gunyah Goondie + Wurley: The Aboriginal Architecture of Australia, at Avid Reader bookshop.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Good morning, early birds. The army has been brought in to enforce stay-at-home orders in NSW, and a refugee who was detained for 15 months under the medivac legislation is set to sue the Australian government. It's the news you need to know, with Emma Elsworthy. Emma Elsworthy Jul 30, 2021  11 It’s Friday and you know what that means, folks: it’s national cabinet day. Leaders will be given targets for vaccination levels that will ensure lockdowns become a thing of the past, the ABC says. And it just got easier to get the jab if you’re in Sydney — The Australian ($) reports that walk-in clinics for AstraZeneca are now operating in lots of places in Sydney’s west and south-west. Army troops will come knocking if you’ve tested positive or been a close contact of someone who has, SMH reports. It comes after NSW recorded — yet again — a record number of cases in the Delta outbreak (239). The tough response is in an effort to curb family transmission — more than 200 kids tested positive in the last two weeks. The stakes are high for the economy, too — Treasurer Josh Frydenberg warned Australia could tumble into a recession at the end of the year if the Greater Sydney lockdown doesn’t work, The Age says. A recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth — and September’s quarter is already forecast to shrink by 2.5%. Meanwhile, a man in Texas isn’t making it much easier on NSW people — he pleaded guilty after he tried to sell 50 million masks he did not have to the state government. The government was set to be billed $317.6m for the masks, which is five times the list price, Guardian Australia reports. Many found the mandatory two-week hotel quarantine stint gruelling and isolating. But one refugee was subjected to it for 15 months straight — and he’s suing the government over it, The Age reports. Mostafa “Moz” Azimitabar, 35, left Papua New Guinea in November 2019 bound for Australia to get treatment for his chronic asthma, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other conditions. But he spent more than a year locked away in two Melbourne hotels — a “luxury torture cell”, he says — under the now-repealed medivac legislation. The Kurdish refugee was released with a visa in January, but he described to Guardian Australia how, for over a year, his only physical link with the outside world was a window he could open a few centimetres. If Azimitabar is successful in his lawsuit, it could swing open the door for many more — at least 192 people were brought to Australia under medivac, but many were held in makeshift detention centres and — as former home affairs minister Peter Dutton told 2GB — many didn’t receive treatment. There’s an old (internet) adage that when you use the Holocaust to make a point about something unrelated, you’ve lost the argument. In fact, the phenomenon is so enduring that Godwin’s Law was created. Godwin’s Law states that, the longer an online discussion grows, the higher the probability that someone will use the Nazis or Adolf Hitler to make their point. Julian Burnside is the latest person in the frying pan for such a comparison. The Age reports the former Greens candidate and human rights barrister tweeted that Israel’s ‘‘treatment of the Palestinians looks horribly like the German treatment of the Jews’’ (it’s since been deleted). It was in reference to a report that found Israel may have committed war crimes in May, as The Washington Post reports, including three strikes on Gaza in which 62 civilians were killed. The comparison to the Nazi regime, however, sparked accusations of anti-Semitism, which the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance says is applicable in any “comparison of contemporary Israeli policies to that of the Nazis”. Greens leader Adam Bandt drew a fairly neat line under the whole thing with his response that the Holocaust was ‘‘one of the darkest moments in human history’’ and was ‘‘without modern comparison’’, continuing that “the treatment of the Palestinian people can be condemned on its own facts”. No Reductio ad Hitlerum required. It’s going to be another cracking day of Olympic feats, folks. World number one Ash Barty is back on our screens today in the mixed doubles alongside John Peers. Schedule your lunch break now: swim stars Emma McKeon and Cate Campbell will be in the women’s 100m freestyle today at 11:59am AEST. Today is also day one of the athletics program. In the football, the Matildas will face Great Britain after our nil-all draw against the US. The Opals, our basketball team, is playing for redemption against China after our loss to Belgium. And don’t miss the Rugby Sevens match between Australia and the US, after we walloped China and Japan. There’s loads more — check out ABC’s guide. New Zealand has been declared the best place to ride out a global societal collapse — whether it be climate change, a pandemic, a financial collapse, or other cataclysmic disruptions, reports The Brisbane Times. The study, conducted by Britain’s Anglia Ruskin University, considered land area per capita, distance from population centres and opportunities for agriculture and renewable energy. If you’d prefer to stay more local during the tormenting end of our days, no problemo — Tasmania got a nod in the study too. Considering Tassie is Australia’s best economy, amply stocked with oysters, fast becoming the country’s gin capital, and will pay you to explore if you live there, at least the apocalypse contingency plan looks good. And considering Tasmania is routinely left off maps worldwide, it might fly under the radar while the world folds in on itself in a horrible chaos of fire and brimstone — for a little while, at least! Have a restful weekend folks — it’s all going to be okay. If you weren’t so young, I’d come up there and rip your head off and shit down your throat.  Joshua Massoud The former Channel Seven journalist has lost his defamation case in rather spectacular fashion, brought against media outlets who quoted him as saying he would slit an 18-year-old colleague’s throat, when he had, in fact, threatened to defecate down his decapitated body. The judge called it a “distinction without a difference”. Massoud had been upset that details of his story had been tweeted ahead of its broadcast. Amber Schultz Jul 29, 2021  3 “Mandates exist everywhere in our lives. You wake up in your house built in line with a mandated code, perhaps paid for with rent and a mandated bond submitted to an independent authority. You might drive a car with your mandated insurance, using your mandated driver’s license, and drop your kid off at public day care, where it’s mandated they’re vaccinated under a ‘no jab, no play’ policy, or at school, which follows a mandated curriculum. You go to work in your mandated dress code, eat food from a store that adheres to mandated health codes and cross the road at the mandated pedestrian crossing. “Maybe after work you go to a pub or a concert, where you have to adhere to mandated behaviour codes — dress correctly, don’t be abusive to staff, don’t get too drunk.  Refusing to adhere to these mandates can result in you being refused entry or kicked out, being fired from your workplace or even being thrown in jail. But when it comes to medical mandates, like those being pushed for COVID-19 vaccines, many balk at the idea of being told what to put in their body. Why is the reaction to mandated medicines so visceral — and are they fair?” David Hardaker Jul 29, 2021  25 “On a bigger canvas, the blurring of lines between public duty and private interest endemic to the Nationals has produced a party where almost no behaviour has a consequence — just look at Queensland LNP member George Christensen’s public support for an anti-mask rally, and Matt Canavan going on the radio program of leading US alt-right figure Steve Bannon. It’s the kind of breakdown of respect for democratic processes and transparency that had many in the party hoping former party leader and deputy prime minister John Anderson might return to the fray as the party’s Senate nomination. “Anderson had said he was gravely concerned for the nation’s future and wanted to act as an adviser and mentor to the party’s leadership. However, he lost out to one-time director of the NSW Nationals Ross Cadell, who, in an exquisite closing of the circle, was the man appointed by the NSW state executive to investigate sexual harassment claims against Joyce.” Guy Rundle Jul 29, 2021  82 “For a time, at the start of the Albanese reign, one hoped that this manoeuvre was to buy breathing space in which a new joined-up social democratic policy could be made — one which proposed a modified progressive tax system, together with a real crackdown on corporate overshoring, and which, crucially, told us what specifically they wanted to do with the money.” “Faint hope. Instead we have had relentless low-level factional wars, or manoeuvres, and this tax policy itself appears to be an expression of a left-right stability pact, in which whatever side isn’t in power gets to pick the policies, a la Bill Shorten’s sudden ‘enthusiasm’ for renewables targets last go-around. What a great way to draft a party program … There is no longer a ‘natural fit’ between progressive social policies and social democratic political economics. The ‘low prospect’ groups locked out of power are unrepresented as themselves within Labor because so many actual left unions — construction, admin — have members drawn from the upper strata.” Ariarne Titmus books showdown with Katie Ledecky in Tokyo Olympics 800m freestyle final (ABC) Study finds all-girls schools create ‘stronger’ women (The Herald Sun) ($) Lucinda Price, AKA Froomes: the funniest things I have ever seen (on the internet) (Guardian Australia) The moves that gave Sunisa Lee Olympic gold (The New York Times) Chilling new satellite images expose China’s rapidly expanding nuclear weapons arsenal (news.com.au) Albert Einstein was right (again): Astronomers have detected light from behind a supermassive black hole (ABC) Three die as wildfire rages in southern Turkey (The New Daily) Tunisia: Turmoil continues as president sacks more officials (Al Jazeera) ‘Disgraceful’: Money advice only for rich (The Australian) ($) Israel to offer COVID booster shots for over 60s: PM (Al Jazeera) Why cannabis is still a banned Olympics substance (BBC)  ‘I made a mistake’: Wayne Rooney apologises after pictures surface (The New Daily) Politics is now just a show about the virus — Phillip Coorey (AFR): “Unlike previous governments, which used Parliament to maximise the power of incumbency by legislating changes or at least arguing for them, and thus be seen to be doing something, the current administration, whenever Parliament sits, tries to keep its head down. Even the Gillard/Rudd governments, in their darkest days of dysfunction and civil war, forged ahead with an agenda, be it on climate change or implementing the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Ditto the warring Abbott/Turnbull governments by, for example, arguing for company and income tax reforms. “This government had a small-target agenda before the pandemic came along and gave it a purpose. When the pandemic subsided at the start of this year, it again exposed the lack of an agenda other than the Prime Minister’s stated – and far from insignificant — no. 1 priority of rolling out the vaccine. With that not going so well at the moment, the government faces the prospect of spending almost all of August being belted around the ears by Labor during Question Time with nothing to distract from any of it.” Blaming individuals for spreading COVID lets government off the hook — Annika Smethurst (The SMH): “Earlier in the outbreak, Queensland authorities pinpointed a tradie, who also worked as a male entertainer and was infected with COVID-19 while performing at a hen’s party, as spreading the virus across the border into NSW. It was easier for us to issue a collective “tut tut” than to probe deeper and ask how the healthcare worker he caught it from wasn’t better protected while treating returned travellers. Mobilising citizens around a common enemy, even innocent ones, unites us in anger. These scapegoats may bring us together but it does little to address structural problems or government inaction that allow this virus to spread. “Abroad, governments are increasingly laying blame on the unvaccinated for spreading the virus. In the US, Republican governor Kay Ivey from Alabama recently told her fellow Americans it was “time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks” for rising cases of COVID-19 in the US. Such a narrative implies an individual’s hesitancy, laziness or selfishness is to blame if they get sick, freeing the government of responsibility when it comes to equitable vaccine access or a better communications strategy.” The US will lose credibility over its Afghan withdrawal — Dave Sharma (The Australian) ($): “Biden concedes that the Taliban is at its strongest militarily since 2001. His most senior general, Mark Milley, has been reduced to saying a Taliban takeover is ‘not a foregone conclusion’. If the Taliban were to prevail in Afghanistan, it would be an immense tragedy for the people of that country and a terrifying prospect for the many thousands of Afghans who have helped coalition forces during the past two decades. “But its strategic reverberations will be felt much more widely. Russia and China are already moving in, investing in their relationships with the Taliban and positioning themselves for a takeover. The message it sends to US allies and security partners is chilling. If the US can tear up a two-decade security partnership overnight and coldly abandon an ally of two decades to its fate, then US security assurances begin to trade at a discount.”  Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison will meet with state and territory leaders in national cabinet, held online. The National Portrait Gallery will announce the winner of its photographic prize, with this year’s theme to reflect the impact of the pandemic. History researchers Jessie Mathieson, Jimmy Yan and Anton Donohoe-Marques present via webinar their PhD completion seminars on rural womanhood in Australia, the “Irish Question” and World War II memories and identities, respectively.

Perth Children’s Hospital will host a research skills seminar about the importance of consumer and community involvement, presented by Anne McKenzie from the Telethon Kids Institute. Canberra The Australian Centre on China in the World will host a seminar about Taiwan’s future in the era of Xi Jinping. Darwin Daminmin Art and Culture Festival kicks off, with workshops, bushwalks, buggy tours, short films, music and more, held at Pudakul Aboriginal Cultural Tours.

 Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Good morning, early birds. Barnaby Joyce is set to be challenged for the Nationals leadership, and people in NSW who call 000 but don't need urgent medical attention could be taken to GPs or pharmacies under a new plan to take the pressure off ambulance networks. It's the news you need to know, with Emma Elsworthy. Emma Elsworthy May 27, 2022  2 The blows keep coming for the Coalition after former veterans affairs minister Darren Chester confirmed he’ll challenge Nationals Leader Barnaby Joyce for the top job on Monday, The Age reports. Chester told the paper the Nationals (which held onto all 16 lower house seats) need to take some responsibility for Liberal losses in the cities. It was actually the worst Coalition election result since 1949, ABC says, after the Liberals lost a swath of blue-ribbon seats in Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, in some cases to newly minted teal independents in what was undoubtedly a climate-action voter rebellion. The paper adds that the deputy leader David Littleproud will also challenge Joyce, and former leader Michael McCormack will probably do so too. Speaking of the teals, Victorian MP Tim Smith has written an opinion piece for Spectator Australia ($) about the disaster that unfolded in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs. The federal election result, that is, “not a reference to that time a heavily intoxicated Smith drove his new Jaguar into a child’s bedroom in Hawthorn,” the AFR’s Myriam Robin quipped. Yikes. In the op-ed, Smith called the teals “loud, entitled and rich” but also lampooned his fellow Liberal Melburnian Josh Frydenberg, who was “completely out-campaigned by an affluent political amateur” because, Smith continued, the campaign stood for nothing. It might’ve been a bit rough for Frydenberg to read (even if there is some truth in it) — the former treasurer actually backed Smith over Community Services Minister Mary Wooldridge in a preselection battle back in 2014, as The Age reported at the time. People in NSW who call 000 but don’t need urgent medical attention could be taken to GPs and even pharmacies via taxi under a new plan to take the pressure off ambulance networks, the SMH reports. The paper says NSW Ambulance reached its most severe level of pressure at 3pm yesterday — at one stage there were just seven available ambulances out of 142 on the road. From healthcare to energy pressures — NSW households in dire financial straits can soon get up to an extra $400 a year to deal with surging bills, bringing the total yearly voucher amount available to $1600, the SMH reports. But NSW Opposition Leader Chris Minns pointed to Queensland and asked why we can’t have what they have — electricity providers in the Sunshine state will automatically apply a $175 credit to the next round of all household power bills. The NSW government is (reportedly) bailing out someone, however — construction giant Metricon, according to The Australian ($). Metricon is Australia’s largest homebuilder and is insisting nothing is wrong (“business as usual,” its acting chief said, as The Advertiser ($) writes) — but sources reportedly told the paper the business was on the verge of bankruptcy. A rescue package costing hundreds of millions is on the table, the Oz ($) adds. Meanwhile, lawyers in NSW are asking the state government to extend some of that empathy to people with COVID fines, Guardian Australia reports. Some of the state’s poorest residents bore the brunt of the fines — including people living in small remote towns Walgett, Brewarrina and Wilcannia — and some 3000 kids were hit with fines of up to $5000. The Law Society says many can’t afford to pay them, and it just continues the cycle of debt and disadvantage — indeed people can even end up in jail for not paying the fines. The NT police force will be probed for “evidence of systemic racism” in a coronial inquest into the shooting death of Indigenous man Kumanjayi Walker, The Australian ($) reports. The 19-year-old Walker was shot three times by police officer Zachary Rolfe, 30, who was later acquitted of Walker’s murder. The inquest will also look at Rolfe’s background and conduct — including whether he was using drugs at the time, The New Daily adds. After the trial, evidence emerged that Rolfe had allegedly engaged in “excessive use of force” against Indigenous suspects, and had described Alice Springs as a place where cops did “cowboy stuff with no rules”. But the focus of the inquest will be mostly on the NT police force’s response, including looking at how police can make sure a death like Walker’s does not happen again. Meanwhile, two Indigenous artworks by Wurundjeri artist William Barak are coming home after his family won two high profile auction bids in New York, The New Daily reports. The Victorian government pledged half a million dollars to help buy the works, which date back to 1897 — elder Ron Jones says he had lost all hope they’d be able to afford them, and described himself as “so pumped” that they won. Victorian Aboriginal Affairs Minister Gabrielle Williams says she’s pleased the works will return to Country, where they rightfully belong. A coffee shop in Italy has been fined $1500 because an irate customer could not believe he was charged $3 for a cup of decaf espresso. It was an average day in Florence when the man rolled into Ditta Artigianale, which serves up award-winning coffee in that fast-paced style Italian coffee bars are known for (lots of standing, yelling, and downing tiny cups). The man ordered his espresso, expecting to pay about a euro ($1.50) which is the average in Italy. When he got slugged with the bill asking double that, the man promptly called the cops. His argument was that the price was not displayed, and the Italian police agreed, dolling out the hefty fine. Ditta Artigianale’s owner Francesco Sanapo was indignant. “They fined me because somebody got offended for paying €2 for a decaffeinated coffee [which involves a water extraction process]. Can you believe it?” Sanapo said in a video while holding up a letter from the police. Some of the coffee joint’s regulars shared in his dismay. “If this customer went to London he’d get the FBI involved,” one wrote on Facebook. I’d hate to think how that man would react to getting slugged $6 for an oat milk cappuccino in Melbourne… Hoping you feel brave enough to take a stand today too — and have a restful weekend ahead. I don’t think you need to be nasty and mean. I’m not the prettiest bloke on the block but I hope that I’m going to be pretty effective.  Peter Dutton The likely next Liberal Party leader says Labor MP Tanya Plibersek’s comments about him looking like Voldemort were not very nice — though some critics were quick to point out Dutton hasn’t exactly made his name on being kind and empathetic — Dutton boycotted the apology to the Stolen Generation, apologised to journalist Samantha Maiden for calling her a “mad fucking witch”, and said some refugee women had “claimed that they’ve been raped” in order to come to Australia. Cam Wilson May 26, 2022  8  “In fact, if you compare their average primary vote per seat in each state, Pauline Hanson’s party has gone backwards. If you look at Queensland, where it ran candidates in every seat except for Kennedy (where Bob Katter is the sitting member) in both 2019 and 2022, it suffered a swing against them of 1.4%. “Dr Kurt Sengul is a researcher at the University of Sydney who wrote his doctoral thesis on Pauline Hanson, populism and the far right. He says that support for minor right-wing parties hitting a ceiling this election is part of a broader story about the movement’s inability to organise behind one candidate.” Amber Schultz May 26, 2022  54  “In many ways, Payne would have been well positioned to rebuild the bridge between Liberal conservatives and moderates. She is a moderate, taking a stand against her party on issues around women’s rights, Indigenous rights, drug law reform and detention of illegal immigrants. “Her appointment could have helped bridge the divide between the NSW Liberals and the federal branch after Morrison’s gung-ho attempt at intervening to resolve a factional feud. Payne’s partner, Stuart Ayres, is the deputy leader of the NSW Liberals. But more than her connection and ideals, it’s Payne’s style that would have appealed to voters” Guy Rundle May 26, 2022  61 “Of the Liberals’ remaining eight seats — eight seats! — in Victoria, four are more marginal than Labor’s only marginal, McEwan. Of the other four, none are held at greater than 60/40. If the Liberal Party moves right, then Aston, Deakin and Menzies — eastern suburbs seats filling up with young professionals — could all go to Labor, or to suburban centrist independents (Cyans? Violets? I dunno). With no reason to expect gain elsewhere. “The obvious point is that, on the numbers alone, it’s a better bet to try and reconstruct the party in a hmmm-liberal direction, so it can be competitive in — hear me out on this — seats it usually wins. But if the darkists can take it rightwards for their internal factional purposes, and leave it there, they could take the non-LNP Liberal Party down to 15 seats, and we are there for it. We want it darker.” Goodfellas star Ray Liotta dies aged 67 (BBC) Palestinian probe says Israeli forces deliberately shot Abu Akleh (Al Jazeera) Kevin Spacey facing sexual assault charges in Britain (The New York Times) ‘It seems this heat will take our lives’: Pakistan city fearful after hitting 51C (The Guardian) Texas shooting: Police accused of delay in storming Uvalde school (BBC) UN envoy tells of serious concern at Taliban’s ‘erasure of women’ (Al Jazeera) Trump said to have reacted approvingly to Jan. 6 chants about hanging Pence (The New York Times) A third of recent cannabis users say they have driven while high: government survey (CBC)
 Don’t talk to me about ‘civility.’ On Tuesday morning those children were alive. — Roxanne Gay (The New York Times): “Incivility runs through the history of this country, founded on stolen land, built with the labor of stolen lives. The document that governs our lives effectively denied more than half of the population the right to vote. It counted only three-fifths of the enslaved population when determining representation. If you want to talk about incivility, let us be clear about how deep those roots reach. The United States has become ungovernable not because of political differences or protest or a lack of civility but because this is a country unwilling to protect and care for its citizens — its women, its racial minorities and especially its children. “When politicians talk about civility and public discourse, what they’re really saying is that they would prefer for people to remain silent in the face of injustice. They want marginalized people to accept that the conditions of oppression are unalterable facts of life. They want to luxuriate in the power they hold, where they never have to compromise, never have to confront their consciences or lack thereof, never have to face the consequences of their inaction. Gun violence is one of the problems with which they need not concern themselves because they believe these calamities will never affect them or their families.” Stellar first week for Anthony Albanese but tough months ahead — Michelle Grattan (The Conversation): “An incoming government has, for a limited period, a sort of immunity from blame. It’s able to say it has ‘inherited’ a bad situation. But this doesn’t last — anyway, the situation itself has to be dealt with, as best the government can. Chalmers on Wednesday said he would be ‘blunt’ in the economic statement he’ll deliver when parliament sits. He highlighted the negatives facing the Australian economy — rising inflation, increasing interest rates, the squeeze on wages. He pointed in particular to the inflationary spikes in power prices and building costs … “For many Australians the remainder of this year will be very difficult, and there is not much the government can do about it. The October budget will be a juggling act for Chalmers and Finance Minister Katy Gallagher (they’re already searching for savings), and not as benign as the March one. One feature of Albanese’s first week was his signal he is apparently determined to try to improve political behaviour. He publicly rebuked his frontbencher Tanya Plibersek for insulting Peter Dutton, who next week will become opposition leader.”  Online The Centre for CSR Development Ukraine’s Maryna Saprykina will speak at the Fiona Wain Oration which will focus on the conflict in Ukraine and is held by the Business Council for Sustainable Development Australia. Yuggera Country (also known as Brisbane) Urban development expert David Wilmoth will talk about his new book, The Promise of the City: Adventures in learning cities and higher education at Avid Reader bookshop. You can also catch this one online. Kulin Nation Country (also known as Melbourne) Poet Andy Jackson, writers Sarah Krasnostein and Rick Morton, and storyteller Allara will speak at the Wheeler Centre’s latest salon series — Love and Vulnerability.
