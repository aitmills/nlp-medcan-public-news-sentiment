NSYEn61CM4Q,Medicinal marijuana to be grown in Australia,2015-10-17T21:27:08Z,welcome back to weekend sunrise the federal government has today announced a plan to allow decontrolled cultivation of marijuana for medical purposes across Australia Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will seek parliamentary support for draft amendments to the narcotics Act it would allow cannabis to be grown in a safe and legal manner joining us in our Canberra studio is health minister Susan Leigh good morning to you Minister may come as a surprise to many what sparked the move and how will it work well the stories of so many patients and their suffering their inability to get pain relief a group of children with a type of epilepsy for whom it's been demonstrated that medicinal cannabis does work all of those stories have moved all of us across the country to take the steps that we are the Commonwealth is providing the missing legislative piece because currently if any state or territory cultivates cannabis for medicinal purposes they're in breach of our international conventions so we are drafting amendments to our narcotics drugs act in order that this process not be in breach of international conventions and that those who want to manufacture a product and bring it to patients can do so so Minister for years state and federal governments have said well we're not convinced to the therapeutic benefits of cannabis or cannabis extracts you obviously are convinced of that is a have you stipulated the range of illnesses for which it may be used we won't be doing that the states are conducting clinical trials and remember as a patient all of these treatments should be taken with your doctor at the centre of your treatment program and at the moment you can in fact important it's happening cannabinoids it's a typically a tincture or oil that is ingested it's very expensive it's very difficult to obtain the demand in the places where it's produced overseas is so high anyway the missing piece that we're going to provide at federal level is the ability for that cultivation to happen and then special access will be available for example for terminally ill patients who can't wait for a process that tests something that would normally go through our therapeutic goods agency that agency will still be part of this process but I want to emphasize that special access scheme for those who will be in urgent need and one of the things you have emphasized 10 Minister is that you'll be closely managing their supply of medicinal cannabis from farm to pharmacy how can you track that and make sure that the cannabis is being grown and used for the purposes that you intend well by licensing its growth inside the Department of Health in the same way that we do actually with opium poppies typically grown in Tasmania we will under our international obligations have to identify what crops are grown and what the fate of those crops is so it will be closely managed as you say from farm to pharmacy in order that there be a safe and sustainable supply of medicinal cannabis for patients as soon as possible Minister whenever we discuss this we get a lot of feedback from our viewers so just to be very clear are we talking about legalizing for medicinal purposes only cannabinoid products or will people suffering from certain ailments actually be able to smoke pot well that's not the intention this is not a product that is smoked this is not about somebody saying I'm smoking and illegal product is it it often is in some circumstances because I have an illness it's not about that at all this is carefully controlled carefully managed and it is a product as I said that is typically ingested we will see through our clinical trials what works best it's not for us to say that at this stage but it is important that the people who are undergoing pain that cannot be relieved by other circumstances and whose doctors believe that this will help get access yeah Minister what was the tipping point for this as you said before it kind of came out of nowhere no is expecting this legislation to be put forward was there a particular case or particularly compelling argument that give it this was the right thing to do it's been discussed for a long time edweena it's not something that has just suddenly come up but I guess in turning my attention to it and talking to my departmental officials my question was what do we need to do because we keep coming up against these international conventions so we need to amend the Act to allow this to take place already the states and I particularly want to commend New South Wales so I'm meeting at Westmead Hospital later this morning you know they've started clinical trials they're absolutely ready to go as our other states because they've been approached by their patients by their doctors by their cancer communities by children with epilepsy and their carers so they're ready to go and what we needed the Commonwealth to do was to provide this missing piece to actually allow this to happen without this amendment to our act this actually can't take place well Minister we know as I say from our previous discussions on the show that there will be tens of thousands of people who are incredibly grateful that the government has been listening and and monitoring the research and is going down this path so you can see how it plays out legislatively thank you for joining us this morning thank you
HrfglrYlJPA,Discussions on Medicinal Cannabis,2015-09-15T06:29:51Z,the challenge was trying to figure out how cannabis may be helpful for patients is one that palliative care clinicians struggle with in lots of different countries clearly there's benefits from having this option in symptom management so I say why not have everything available to us my feeling is that we have enough medication available for treatment of the symptoms associated with the palliative care I'm me neither in favor or not in favor I feel that it does have a purpose in a role in palliative care but I think it has to be very carefully monitored the challenge for clinicians is that we want to be able to make sure we're offering something that's helpful to our patients but at the same time we don't have a lot of research information I think we need to do the evidence I'm a doctor I believe in evidence-based practice if if we can find a way in which any therapeutic drug including medicinal cannabis if it if it is effective if it's safe if it goes through the trials and yeah I'm more than happy to explore that at this stage I'm not in not in favor probably cuz I don't know enough about it I definitely think there needs to be a little bit more research done in the area as long as you know everybody's informed about what's being taken so that the medical team are aware if there might be any kind of side effects and things like that associated with any other treatments it is a difficult dilemma you know it's illegal at the moment however it is hard when there aren't really much in the way of trials we do have a lot of social attitudes around the use of cannabis and its associations with unwanted druggies and we can't ignore those just like any other analgesic or opioid there the potential for misuse or abuse is outweighed from the need of symptom treatments so that's far more a priority in a person's seeking that medication rather than addiction or misuse of it I think people can get focused on what what is working which is great but but let that limit expanding what else could possibly work what might be better after I just think that it has such a potential Peru for harm to society that I I don't feel that there's a place in it we really do need to have the conversation and not shut it down because oh my goodness it's cannabis and therefore drug abuse if it proves to be therapeutic I am definitely in favor of anything that would help pain management in for pediatric or adult patients I have rhetoric and clinical experience that says to me I don't know if it was coincidence or not but I've certainly seen in a couple of families it made the difference and it made the difference to the child's clinical symptoms but also to how the family felt about their sense of control if the evidence is there that it's not harmful if it's something that people will find helpful on that basis it seems like an entirely reasonable thing to try I don't think I think there's so much we don't know I don't think we know dosing I don't think we know the regime I don't think we know the patients that are the most appropriate candidates so I think it's really about the research for me
KCuGJpLDieA,Australia to trial medical cannabis on children with epilepsy,2015-10-28T12:34:29Z,
ohMeUJPyRiQ,Medical Cannabis: What people with arthritis need to know,2015-07-07T08:33:15Z,I'm dr. Jason MacDougall I'm a professor of honestly 0 del University and I also too committee at the arthritis Society so cannabis is my family of hem the hem family and marijuana is pretty much the same thing it's just more of a slang term so we prefer to adhere to the scientific naming of cannabis cannabinoid is a hammock it's found within the plant the cannabis plant and it can also be a chemical that mimics the cannabis plant so it could be man-made or it could be naturally occurring in our bodies so they're actually three different types of cannabinoid there are the fatal cannabinoids which are the ones that are found within the cannabis plant the synthetic cannabinoids which are the man-made chemicals the pharmaceutical preparations and then they're the endocannabinoids which are the naturally occurring cannabis like compounds that a caramel produced in our bodies there were many active Cannabis the two most well known ones are THC and CBD THC stands for tetrahydrocannabinol and that's the psychoactive component of cannabis CBD is cannabidiol and that has been shown to be effective at controlling pain and inflammation and but it doesn't have the psychoactive properties the same way that THC does so medical cannabis is the cannabis that's prescribed by your doctor and could be an either the herbal form either a synthetic form and there's some evidence to show that it can be effective in alleviating arthritis pain as well as inflammation and fatigue different ways of administering cannabis can be either smoked or ingested in oral form baked into cookies or produced in the oil of butters but they're also synthetic cannabinoids that can be taken as a tablet or as a spray underneath the tongue different strains of cannabis different types of cannabis and they vary and the amount of THC and CBD that they contain and it's important to know that because they may have different impacts in various populations of patients we'll just like any drug there are a number of different side effects associated with cannabis and so it may not be appropriate for all arthritis patients so we really really need more research try and understand the safety profile of the different strains of cannabis there's been a lot of experimental evidence to show that cannabis can be effective in treating the pains of arthritis as well as the inflammation and helping with fatigue but we really need more clinical studies to try and understand benefits and potential limitations of using cannabis so further research into medical cannabis is required so we can understand the different subpopulations of patients who may be responsive to medical cannabis we need to find out the effective dose of medical cannabis some of the interactions with other drugs as well as looking at different delivery systems you
fYMCA_Tg_vk,CBD Oil: How To Make Cannabis Oil at Home - Easily!,2015-12-22T20:24:40Z,"Welcome to Endoca's beautiful organic
cannabis fields. Come I'll show you Well, in order to make a good cannabis extract
you need good starting plant material. In my hand I have a cannabis plant it
smells fantastic. In order to make a nice extract you need to obviously dry the
plant material first. Come let's go to the lab I'll show you how to make an
extract. Welcome to Endoca. My name is Henry Vincente and today I will show you
how to cannabis extraction using ethanol We will use cannabis material which is
the leaves and the flowers all in one Very important to use organic so that you
know there is nothing inside that can harm you. There are over 4,000 different
varieties of cannabis now the one I chose has a lot of CBD inside. You could
apply the same method or what kind of cannabinoid eschews so called ethanol
take a ball put the plant material inside so the process has to be very
fast. You don't want the ethanol to touch the plant material to a long time. If it
does you get a lot of other stuff inside which you don't want. You just use enough
ethanol to cover so that we can separate the plant material from the cannabinoids. You need to be fast in this process because we can only stir for three
minutes so I use a plastic spoon. You don't use mechanical devices because you
don't want to create a spark. If I create a spark now everything will burn. You mix
well then we have to separate the ethanol from the plant material. I do
simply by taking a sieve and put it in another Bowl. It can drip a little bit
you know there's still some alcohol left This was the first filtration now we're
going to do the second filtration in order to remove the plant material you
have left, and we do that by using a simple coffee machine
It can heat your material and it can filtrate and we start with the
filtration part coffee filter, take your spoon you take now the material on the liquid
and you pour it into the filter paper and you see the process starts. In order
to accelerate the process we change the paper, every time a single filtration has
occurred if you have more material you just continue until you don't have any
more, and like this and it's dripping beautifully. Now it's time to cook so
when you cook at home you can use many different things I have here an example
of a rice cooker which works fine a pot and a heating device works also fine and
a water distiller. Now my favorite is the water distiller because if you cook with
any of these methods we need a cleanroom box like this for those of you who
doesn't have a box like this you can cook outside but to make it all easier
let's use the water distiller. Now this is the process where we separate the
ethanol from the cannabinoids. The time it will take for the full separation
depends of course of how much material you put inside I use a bowl to collect
the pure ethanol that's going to come out here because you can you reuse it
again and again we give it some juice and we wait so now the question is when
to stop I can see I have 80% of my original ethanol volume so that's
indication that it's time to see what's going on inside you open the lid slowly
and look inside and you can see that is very little material in my case this is
the time to stop just to be sure not to breathe it here we go and be careful
when you pour because there's very little material you don't want to lose
it and now I'm going to show you the final step using the coffee machine what
we have to do is remove the remaining ethanol from our extract put it on the
heating device turn it on and we wait best is to wait for 24 hours so that
you're sure that no ethanol is left I already did this and as you can see from
all the work with it we have very little material the final test is a quality
test we do it by using a paperclip dipping it into the material and you use
a lighter you light it fast and see what happens if there is a spark you know there is 
still ethanol left so you can see comparison see it's burning then you
need to put it back on the heater but in our case it was well done. To make a
cannabis extract at home you need a lighter
filter coffee machine some small bowls, two bowls
sieve plastic spoon coffee filters alcohol cannabis. Put the cannabis into
the bowl cover with cold alcohol steer three minutes with plastic spoon filter
the alcohol through the sieve filter again through the coffee filter it still
until 80 percent of the initial alcohol volume is gone pour into a small ball
hit the small ball with the coffee machine for 24 hours to remove the
remaining alcohol. To check if there is any remaining alcohol use a small spoon
and the lighter if there is any remaining alcohol the product will
produce sparks when burning with a lighter keep heating until you don't get
any sparks anymore Enjoy your cannabis extract Stay tuned
next time I'm going to show you how to purify the extract and turn it into pure
cannabinoids in my hand is 99% CBD beautiful crystals See you next time"
WQsahk0Qv8I,Voices Behind Medical Cannabis - Epilepsy Action Australia,2015-11-04T05:16:11Z,"welcome to epilepsy action describe the special presentation the voices behind the issue medicinal cannabis the actual presentation was actually healthy yesterday and I started it with some words from the World Health Organization about epilepsy is doubtful if there is any other medical condition so universally neglected jr. a combination of social stigma low profile and lack of resources it is the world's most common serious brain disorder and with the emergence of medicinal cannabis in a variety of health conditions the focus is shifted to epilepsy raising curiosity and awareness of epilepsy in fact like no other issue has today on Carroll Island on the chief executive officer of epilepsy action Australia on a personal note I first discovered the impact of seizures on family when I was just a young child growing up with an older brother who had epilepsy in fact on now his primary carer but still until I joined epilepsy action Australia in 2006 I really didn't have any idea how many people face the challenge of seizures or how complex and varied their needs completely at the session yesterday we were delighted to have as our first speaker the Honorable Pru Goward Minister for Mental Health Minister for medical research assistant minister for health amongst other responsibilities now unfortunately due to technical difficulties it often happens we're actually unable to bring you this particular section of the original recording however I want to and in summary the minister outlined the New South Wales government scheme it Minh and their investment in clinical trials to explore the use of cannabis products for children with severe epilepsy and that will be through a partnership with Sydney Children's Hospital network the New South Wales Government has already committed an additional 12 million to the originally allocated nine million dollars for teen trials of medicinal cannabis yesterday the announcement spoke about a specific 3.5 million that would be earmarked for trials involving children with severe medication resistant epilepsy a minister Gaillard commented that initially she was a skeptic when it came to dismal cannabis that was after seeing the effects of recreational use of cannabis in a neuromas Minister for mental health it was unhealthy meeting with researchers and medical staff that she began to understand the potential therapeutic benefits then hearing the experiences of families of children with severe epilepsy and how desperate parents were for the opportunity to try a treatment that just may work for their child she became what she called little minister gehrer was determined to secure with supplies of the cannabinoid products needed for the clinical trials and she actually personally flew London and negotiated an arrangement with GW Pharmaceuticals there are actually two parts to this arrangement that was announced yesterday that will potentially benefit Australian children firstly an exciting world first in trialing Canada Devoran or CBD 3 in children with medication resistant epilepsy now the results from earlier overseas trials of CB TV without alts who have epilepsy but actually shown really promising results but the pediatric trials in New South Wales will add something new to the body of research already underway internationally rather than just repeating studies that are already underway in some of the country secondary there will be a limited supply there the dialects or cannabidiol say they do available and compassionate places for children who are actually too unwell to participate in the trials of CBD V epidemics is currently in phase 3 trials overseas so we'd also be a part of that now researchers will be designing the first of the trials over coming months and expected to open recruitment in early to mid 2016 this is a New South Wales based trial and residents from other states and territories in Australia will need to await for information on potential study hospital science and global development and involvement until I share this normal with you further information will be available on the New South Wales trials and there is a hotline set up so the cannabis trials helpline and is 1-800 two one seven two five seven one eight hundred two one seven two five seven so in essence Australia's agreement with GW Pharma and and our trials will mean that we'll be able to fast-track the access to improve medications earlier than we expected earlier than the three to four years it usually takes for a medicine to reach the Australian market the plan of course is to have approved junk drugs listed on the PBS GW Pharmaceuticals is also planning an international phase three clinical trial in 2016 to children with tuberous sclerosis complex as well as face two clinical trials for children with infantile spasms and if indicated their preference for New South Wales to be the state for these trials after Ms gal expose I congratulated the minister on her tenacity in achieving the GW Pharma agreement in fact they had initially declined a proposal from Australia and many including myself thought that the Minister flying over herself speaking face-to-face would probably not change the situation but her determination and her obviously stronger go skating skills proved to be to the benefit of children in Australia with epilepsy and the clinical trials now set to commence earlier than we had thought now you'll now be taken to the rest of the recording that didn't succeed yesterday without further technical hitch and I hope you find it really interesting thank you she is as I said unrelenting in her states to raise awareness of medicinal cannabis and she's also going to introduce us to the sunshine Thank You Michelle it's the first time I've actually prepared a speech I've done a lot of symposiums spoken in the media at least 30 times so today to try and keep it short I've written my first speech so hopefully I'll still be able to make her eye contact but to understand just roughly by this picture he's been displayed behind me that was my son's eye I know the statement some may may not agree with I believed he is and was illegally stoned for five years he was basically on a lot of pharmaceutical products over these five years majority were high doses every single one came with a long list of side effects this was just the beginning every single one of these impacted not only our lives our children's lives but make the condition a lot worse so I just needed that up as a parent I stand here before you because that's what epilepsy is soul destroying it continually takes and it keeps on taking it is a never-ending grieving process with no known cure we are one of the 30 to 40% of the epilepsy population that has a child with refractory epilepsy who is also deemed inoperable Landrieu Clinton is syndrome ASCs CHWs a spike rate of three to five seconds and pseudo Lenox syndrome a combination of three rare neurological condition our lks currently rates as a seventh rarest neurological disease in the world aphasia I prefer to call that childhood dementia the slate is constantly wiped clean with regression the days weeks months at a time Joe was nonverbal Joe did not know who he was where he was or how to even perform a simple task more times than I can remember Joe has endured every type of seizure and thousands of them he exhausted all recommended pharmaceutical medications that were told for us as parents to administer not one of these pharmaceutical medications ever reduced one seizure for five years he was legally stoned and addicted to hide dohsa narcotic pharmaceutical medications in Queensland Jersey neurologist stated he was having up to 500 seizures a day he was described on national TV as being one of the most complex cases his neurologist says of adult with in Victoria the very first EEG we were informed by the MU nurse that she hadn't seen a case like jazz in over 40 years though outdated 56 state joy may grow out of lks when he hits puberty first we need to get in there and second what damage is done cannot be reversed any seizure at any time could certainly be his last jog will always be outside the box his complex and his seizures have been brutal and life-threatening we had performed CPR as I have my children we've experienced recess we've experienced some convulsive status broken bones smashed me cheap signs lead machines medications after medications Hospital became alkaline for nearly five years December 2014 life spiraled out of control because I believe all joy had was a heartbeat with that in mind I want you to stop and I want you to pause my ways I don't know how it works I don't know why it works but it works trainee Bower is Joe's THC a cannabis expert Lynne cleaver Tasmania is treating her adult son Jeremy with CBD THC THC a the late David Stephens New South Wales was treating his daughter day show with CBD we know it works as parents we see the results we see it firsthand live this how many more children will die from Sutekh or organ failure from synthetic chemically made pharmaceutical medications between now and the end of these trials no child with catastrophic refractory epilepsy should be placed on any placebo trial to rule out whole plant whole plant cannabis therapy is simply murderous if three children you know three different types of epilepsy using three or four different types of combinations we cannot cater one component or one extraction for all I refer to either Pathak refractory epilepsy as dancing daily with the devil we simply need to remove the politics from this and bring in the cannabis experts my son has enjoyed 37 aegs aegs ERG sv jeez and not one has ever showed a reduction in slow sleep spike woes until now you can try and argue my results here you can't argue though with medical evidence and you can't argue with what I'm about to show you I want to introduce you to my sunshine I am time I am 11 I live in Benton I were born healthy in chainrings 2010 I got sick I have big seizes the doctor said I have a blessing I had free where types I do remember my way up I was impossible a lot I have a large chest I wanted to good school play and have a lot of fun but I will to sit turn he'll get make me more sips 35 pound a day I got terribly meals and hu to my belly my hand always and I'll have to wear helmet I have a lot of everyone's glides in a lot of people say my life one day my mom said to my daughter that my company yeah laughs and my mom saw said my mom didn't sleep much because she had to keep me safe my mum on TV Allah with me and him for help she didn't want me to die my mum spoke to a lot of important people but no one listened but keep trying nice a lot of friends although our kids like me dawn every day funky that didn't work my life forget it December 2014 by head start earning I woke up I feel so good I can talk I can walk I can eat I can play I can watch I can now eat I am Alive cancer medicine help me stay alive mommy Bella make my medicine you care about me sweet now my mom I that is crazy I am cat I am 11 I want the Lord to be king so everyone can be healthy like me I think this there's not too much for me to say Michelle enjoy Whitelaw does anyone have any questions willing with the benefit of hindsight yeah what's your advice to these people here don't like I've said it many times but I was reluctant because my husband is employed through the federal government so I have treated children most people only concentrate on job but I also have a 16 year old would type 1 diabetes congenital heart and you know the list goes on and on so you know I have had adult children also that work into health industry so we had a lot but at the end of the day I believe that you know would boy running out of time there was no other medications what do you do i sat on the couch for two days and I've said this time and time again not that you know do I do I kill him and kill myself it was that real because I didn't want to continue I did not want to see him suffer or break the law of a criminal and risk and you know what I have no regrets no regrets at all it's 320 days we've seen four seizures I don't know if he's having subclinical seizures anymore but now he's back at school he can write for the first time in 18 months you know he's got his first academic report the school supports a doctor I'd been to our family doctor to report a set of dogs because I didn't want to hanging over my head but you know what no no report me and God hope amidst a tree because I have all the video of evidence I have for five years I've been documenting giant and journey I've contacted every Federal Health Minister state minister premiers all around Australia for three years ago all of our mothers have been investigated by divers yeah and in all cases dots and the police yep and in all cases they backed away so the greater good was my meaningless as that as well absolutely yeah but not being one of the very few parents that are bathing the media like shreya Connell there are my eyes to children to destacia free dravet syndrome hello you know and when cleaver in Tasmania you know she's growing her own and been to the place I've been on the TV with the police minister the police community commissioner everyone and you know I hadn't I baked for 12 months I didn't want to break the law you want a break there was someone help me no one listened and that's why I thought you know he's gonna die if I don't break the law I as a duty of care as a mother have failed him so you know no regrets I think if you can do it do it who knows that timeframe for these trials but I think that you know the research is so exciting you know I don't condone what I'm doing that my decision was right because my son is a lot of and I have no regrets alone yeah I'm afraid all they ask is made document I'm trained about an accredited young children my son is 11 so adult children I wanted to ask the minister because I was a bit confused in regards with had SAS authority scripts and stuff but you know these trials should not discriminate adults you know my girlfriend Lynn cleaver long as she's been a month it's been following us for five years his son Jeremy is the same age as my adult son is 25 she from the age of six she has done more pintura held a lot more than what our family has but I've watched my teenage daughter perform CPR until the paramedics arrived you know that she does it they still here he's not so sure for a she Rose I'm using all different types of components trying to be the scientist we shouldn't have to be his parents we shouldn't you know but um she couldn't wait he's an adult ie they are old mates we're just a nun like I said yeah highly I highly recommend you your research but you know for at least 18 months before I took it I made sure I was up his steroids I made sure it suffix benzos I made sure he ate this off bellingham because he was all high doses and depending on my element or what component you're looking at be able to test and find out anyway a lot of those can interact but then a lot of them they're finding now that the latest research overseas that some CBD products with an extra letter on the end can actually help with the wedding of benzos so it's not a kid's toy you just can't blame these meds yeah J we use otherwise comes in two types and seven all and hemp seed I believe the hemp seed alone has got nutritional value it's high in omega three six and nine lot stronger than any official oh I'm just using couple of drops in the morning during the daytime its ethanol I'm soaked in gummy bears so he just thinks of everything and at nighttime that pampers that said all with also at owners aids with sleep so our problem is joy um can only do half days at school because he needs a dose half day halfway through the day in her school currently start their school or know as one hundred I think sorry twelve twenty children at that school over a hundred teachers and they all support they've all seen giant for the last four nine five years we didn't think you'd be gone back to school yeah it's just an we might need to hold them yes sorry we might need to hold there just to get through our presentations and perhaps there'll be an opportunity for people to talk afterwards I think you'll agree Michelle is an extremely courageous person and and certainly a mother with with great passion and make personal decisions as I said earlier there are many perspectives and as you heard Michelle say there is a parent's choice we also need the science so it shouldn't be one approach against another I think this is the thing we all should be moving in the same direction here which which brings me to our final presentation some of you may recall that a very large amount of money I think it was thirty three point seven million dollars was donated by the Lambert family to Sydney University the Lambert initiative is providing a platform for extensive clinical clinical and scientific cannabinoid related research drawing on expertise from the researchers from the University of Sydney and departments throughout the world we've got two of the lead researchers here to present with us today we have a number of the media today so welcome to all of you who I can see the front row welcome to all of you but speaking today Professor Ian McGregor Ian is an international leader in cannabinoid research more than 20 years and impressive background as a psychopharmacologist investigating medicinal chemistry drug development novel psychoactive drugs analytical toxicology I can almost not say these things in behavioral ecology preclinical psychopharmacology in human clinical trials it was appointed the preclinical director as I lay that initiative for cannabinoid therapeutics earlier this year also a lot to introduce to you clinical associate professor Nicholas and interests a leading addiction medicine special and researcher working in the drug and alcohol field for over 20 years he's an expert in clinical trial design drug policy and regulatory issues and lead investigator on a clinical trial of sativex an oral spray containing cannabinoids as a treatment for cannabis dependence I'm sure you'll agree they're very well qualified to be leading this important initiative epilepsy action Australia is very proud to be collaborating with you and allows you to please come up well g'day everyone it's something to be here like too busy no I advance my slides tourists just it down all the other point on the other one signing yep yeah so if you are sitting in the library Siobhan could be put back right in today but this is our website at the University of Sydney and there's a very interesting story I guess that goes back to November of last year when Lucy Haslam and you may be seen in Australia's story history story last week I organized symposium for and medicine cannabinoids and absorbed by the friend year Mike Baird and naked Dave and myself went up to town Mart for this event which was really very interesting and it came about and sure you know Lucy's story because that her son Diane had Stage four volcano certified mechanicus was the only thing that relieved his pain and extreme nausea an incredible story I'm Mike Baird and I actually like to credit the New South Wales Government for their amazing support and leadership nationally in medicinal cannabis space and this was exemplified at this very early stage in November last year with the premiere actually old thing there's a conference on the medicinal and cannabinoids and we might have been spoke a little bit by the science of the end system of the brain and have some of the cannabis space medications might work and we met Michael Lambert up there who some of you may know who's the father of Kaitlyn who suffers from driving syndrome I'm dead Kaitlyn was having many many seizures every day he was really struggling and he find that the use of pen of the dial CED gave excellent control over her seizures that they were importing this from Denmark and there's many stories like this that were breaking the law they were desperate to find something that would help Kaitlyn with CD with this preparation called in dolkha Kaitlyn was in the Twitter kindy was just an amazing thing for their family to see her let's be able to be well enough to so very very passionate about cannabinoids and when we get Michael get them in regard with them in a couple weeks later he called Eagle salt here and said by the way my father's is a very high net worth individual I would like to support research into that as well joiwind Bertie's as formidable character got a greatly and through many discussions with them we hatched a scheme to set up an initiative at the University of Sydney for the of the medicinal cannabinoids and it wasn't the thirty three point seven million dollars that they donate either some incredible act of generosity and for us an awesome responsibility to prosecute this mission to really lead not only New South Wales in Australia but the world if we can but it's an incredible opportunity these things very rarely happened to scientists normally we're trying to win the Nobel Prize with a matchbox in the elastic bands you never you never usually get everything that you asked for so this is an incredible development for us and our major aim is to develop new cannabinoid based medications for the treatment of a range of diseases now battery lambreaux is extremely several bull Caitlin over Sam's drive aids and our primary interest is epilepsy we believe that can happen like this medications can be of assistance for a whole range of human suffering so they didn't want to limit our research school simply to make Pepsi so we have interests in pain and cancer dementia mental illness addictions and metabolic disorders as well so we're very broad-ranging what is this based on well it's based on the realization that everyone is walking around with cannabinoids in their brain we all have this endocannabinoid system in our brain and our body and we still want to teach kids to go through Medical School about the system it's that new that the endocannabinoid system underpins just about every physiological process you can think of it's in your skinniness in your fact it's your brain sending blood it's in your immune system that regulates all these processes and we're really just at the beginning of understanding this able cannabinoid system if you look at the brain what is the most common receptor in your brain it's the cannabinoid for Center the one that interacts with these cannabis like molecules the endocannabinoids in our brains and one of the most important things that system does is regularly neuronal excitability so the aim that cannabinoids can the brain down when it's too excited and they can also bring it up when it's too inhibited as well they regulate the torn the electrical torn of the brain you might be starting to see the connection with epilepsy now and we're starting to realize in some forms of epilepsy and vulnerability to at play FC is associated with this regulation of this Indian cannabinoid system and we also realize that a number of other illnesses that humans suffer from schizophrenia the nature pain can also be linked to deficits and system so how do you actually you know alter these seven missing the system well there's a whole range of receptors that you can trigger artificially through medications that can restore balance and equilibrium to that system and these endocannabinoids work on arranged in four sectors that we can use plant-based cannabinoids and also synthetic cannabinoids to also regulate so your score balance for that system for itself of regulation you may not realize but this medication which I'm sure everyone in the room is tribus these things how does that work that works on your angle cannot your system panadol actually regulate symptoms of having order superbrain to believe p that's how ubiquitous that's how important your endocannabinoids are yeah we're just starting to learn how this system works so what about the cannabis plant oh it's a very complex beasty there's incredible medicinal potential in it but gorillas just the same as the endocannabinoids system of the brain body we're just in the way starting to learn about this potential within the planet there's more than a hundred different cannabinoids in the plant and a lot of them have the abbreviation is THC CBD THC V I call them the bad Scrabble stigmas what you can see could you actually get work scored 50 points of any of these perhaps more and but maybe something like that me but there's an incredible therapeutic potential not just for the really well-known ones like THC and CBD but in the other hundred that we don't believe one should buy there could be the cure for cancer there could be something amazing for epilepsy that could be the next big drug for pain so this is a really exciting frontier in pharmacology THC we know is the one that gets you stoned is the main intoxicant for some conditions it might be the best medicine we can actually get TM c capsules prescribed in australia the drug of trauma panel contains THC in issues paying and for chemotherapy juice nausea and vomiting but there is a whole lot of other cannabinoids that manage to be better therapies so most of you will know about CBD cannabidiol they strongly anticonvulsant that's where they pee dialects is we also know what strongly antipsychotic if you give CBD to people with schizophrenia it seems as effective the standard antipsychotics in reducing their psychotic symptoms yet it doesn't have the side effects associated with antipsychotic drugs like zyprexa and seroquel it also seems to be neuroprotective as well so it protects the brain from damages it's a wonder drug in a way CBD as far as we know what's more it's also getting at all and we you will have heard about the dialects which is basically a 98% CBD extract phase 3 clinical trials underway the USA my colleague Nick will talk about the improving outcomes of these trials in a minute the one that was announced today is CBD V Canada d'Ivoire in that you've got to practice that's a tricky one to say I just night but interestingly if you look at the I know you're all Ken is here so you'll follow me but if you look at CTV versus CB they're very very similar molecules it's just a sweet squiggly chain at the end is actually torture and see the unique compared to CBD we're still trying to work out the exact difference between CD and CV but as small chemical difference could make a huge therapeutic difference and I actually scientifically think it's very exciting but the trial - today is for CBD v-rod little secret D we're actually a little too earnest something really important with this trial it's not a me to trial it's a chance to define a whole new medication for epilepsy very exciting indeed sorry goodbye just a couple more slides now is cannabis smoke cannabis a couple of years ago we worked Jonathan Arnold that the new Sentinels drug squads worked with my lab I started dropping off the stash I felt like the lab we wanted to work out what the cannabinoid content of local Australian Street cannabis is and what we found was that it's full of THC about 15 percent by weight is THC so I said toxicated stuff but the good is your CB b or c b DV almost non-existent so most of the samples we could barely detect CBD anticonvulsant in there once antipsychotic and this actually means that there's a concern that height is evil cv v will mean that the cannabis is very low therapeutic potential that tends to predispose to addiction and to mental health problems so we need much better cannabis out there if we're going to use it for therapeutic purposes and this is a the way i thing for people that are treating at poetic children or or friends or family that the street cannabis may not be the stuff to go for there's an important lesson now the Hunter Valley is very famous or it's white you probably be not there but it may not more than it's also famous for this this is industrial hemp that is grown by a company called the equal vibrant just like site singleton in the Hunter Valley and they've also opened myself went up there recently to be full Warner he's the CEO of equal fiber there's me having a bit of fun with some of the product when you look at it by contrast with Australian student panelists she finds that it's full of goodies there's hardly any THC 0.5 percent three point five six percent CD but also CBD a which is the precursor seen declined more than 10% by way to CBD a and can convert that CBD to see them be just by heating the plant material so we've got a very rich local source of heavy CD containing plant material and also some CD DV in that local source as well and I think that is very interesting one of the things we want to do is to try and develop a homegrown supply of cannabinoids to develop art therapeutics with and meaningful and loyally like drawings going on up there is very exciting that we're going to work with him on extractions and how to get the cannabinoids out of my hand to develop therapeutics just a couple of extra slides and a freeze up and hand you were to make what else are we working at relative to equal epsy or we're working at a very basic cellular level to try and understand how cannabinoids interface with different types of epilepsy so we all know that Cee can be very very useful we know the CBD v can be very useful but mechanistically we're not quite sure how they're doing that in the brain and when you have mechanism it helps to convince doctors and clinicians to prescribe cannabinoids they like to know how something works so we worked in that very very basic level and to try and work out the mechanistic effects of cannabinoids in epilepsy and we do that with we got machines where we can express targets in particular cells we can take our cannabinoids feed them through this machine and work out hips against particular receptors against particular channels some of you will know that certain types of epilepsy are associated with specific genetic mutations and sodium channels and calcium channels of gaba receptors glycine receptors we can stick all of them in our machine and see whether cannabinoids feel the whole hundred and four cannabinoids if we like our modulating activity at these receptors it's a very fast way of trying to mechanistically understand the effects of cannabinoids in epilepsy we can also do what's called patch clamping electrophysiology and light brain slices to look at the same thing this is an artificial receptors this is looking at brain actually brain slices you can also use minds that particular genetic mutations so for example northern ireland's who's here today as a driving mouse that has the same mutation in a sodium channel that you get in about 70 to 80 percent of kids with driving syndrome I'm a contestant cannabinoids in these mice so basic science gives us some incredibly powerful tools the mechanistically understand what cannabinoids are doing while at the same time I work in plant science and chemistry can help bring the pipeline forward for multiple cannabinoids can be tested against these targets just mentioned Jonathan Arnold over here who's doing one of our preclinical work Jordan Stewart who's an incredibly talented American researchers recently joined the library initiative she's an expert when they bloom cannabinoids and high-throughput screening also proved something what just walked in the library they should have I also want to make sure my cat born whose the night standing I'm excited two weeks ago and then he's working for us in the library this was two weeks ago he was given the USFL's early community center of the Year award from premier Mike Baird and from the chief scientist that aerial King so part of what we're doing on I bet this is trying to get his best friends in the business to come and work with us and prosecute it's really important research so will hopefully put our state in our country at the forefront under this research I'll now hand over to my colleague Nick Matt Saracen talking a little bit about our clinical I have regular 3d activities so thank you thank you again thank you caffeine quiet today and thank you all for attending I'm going to read some walk through a bit of her journey about how do we go from understanding science to actually ending up with medicines available that your doctors will prescribe because I think that's the missing link to anyone cqa but June 8th last night that's not yet so that was a question of a parent with with child didn't say if it was a boy or girl with with epilepsy they've been using medicinal cannabis for some time the question was to a group of politicians so what's going on how we're going to make that happen and every politician in the room pretty much said look I don't understand how or why but let's just sort this out can we can we just make this happen so I think what you're seeing is a lot of goodwill from politicians that we need something to happen and so why is it taking so long and that really they need to understand what is the journey for how we get medicines licensed in this country enters them in any other country so generally in Australia if if a medicines to be licensed general what happens to the drug company that has developed the medicine or is making the medicine will go to the TGA which is an arm of the federal government with their application where they want to then go and apply for a medicine for a particular condition so medicines are not just licensed willy-nilly is for a specific condition that you license it for and generally they need to turn up with three boxes worth of data the first thing is just what is this medicine that you're actually wanting to license so that's the data is about the composition what's in it not just what's the active ingredient but tell us about all the other stuff that goes into the binding the chalk the colorants all those things that so for every tablet or pill or syrup or whatever it is tell us what's in your product is it a bit demonstrate that it is stable what I mean by that is you can put it on the shelf in the pharmacy and come back to it six months later and it still will be what it was six months ago or twelve months or two years so most Muslims will have a shelf life so you have to then go and test stability because the medicine that you're taking today you want to make sure that it's going to work you know that they use by Davis inspired and then we also have a bunch of issues around safety of the medicine so a lot of this then is around bacterial safety so how are you mate how do you know that that medicine is not contaminated in the manufacturing process and so forth there's a range of plant based medicines that get used throughout medicine and that's often an issue with plant basements and is looking at some of the how has it been grown are there fungicides is there heavy metals in the processing and so forth there's a range of a lot of data that the company Ness needs to produce and those things also that buy the stability is in the product and the batch you've made this month is it going to be identical to the battery mate from next month and the month after that and the month after that so a lot of those about the stability of the product so what is the medicine you're wanting to license then the question of is it safe in the patient's you want to use it in and that generally then is looking at you should show us your data shows your evidence that of side effects in the population you want to use the medication so Gerry means they have to go and do what they call safety studies so they give the medicine to a large number of people over a long period of time as we all know many of the conditions we now treat chronic conditions are gone for many many many years and yet most of the studies that look at whether or not something works usually only runs for a few months so freaking epilepsy trials most of the medicines you know the high quality evidence the studies that have been done generally a short term trials of a matter of months and yet we use these medicines for years so there's a there's a separate bunch of questions that have to be addressed about the safety of the medicine in the person you're using it in but there's also queries about issues around what we call teratogenicity so if a person was taking the medicine and they for example fell pregnant while taking the medicine will there be some side effects or crimes for the children that are born and you know big folks that this came out of the medicine that we remember in the 50s before the divide you know because it was a morning there's a yeah the morning sickness medicine given to pregnant women to control their nausea unfortunately because you know we didn't have the regulatory framework back then they ended up being that catastrophic story and then there's a question of does the medicine work and then in in science language X efficacy now the way that scientists doctors are and scientists really the only real way to demonstrate efficacy is this thing called a placebo control stone and that is essentially they some people get a randomized as a random process some people toss of a coin get the active medicine other people get to see Bo sugar pill and then basically the comparison is between the two groups and the reason that's done is because in most medical conditions are complex there's often numerous factors lots of kind of variations that can that can affect whether my messin works and because on the whole realize you don't understand my suppose factors and so the way we kind of you know the way we we deal with that is by setting up these large randomized control trials and you basically hope that the process of randomization factors out all those other variables so some people have a more severe conditions a little mave but got an illness earlier than others and I have a genetic predisposition some people might have other medical problems be another medicines and so forth so the randomized design trial is the way that the regulator's that's the design they rely on to be able to say yep this Merson works or it doesn't work so that's what nice they happen to get a medicine license this is normally a five to ten year process to make that happen if you're selling from scratch we're not standing in scratch so you've heard all about CVD so CBDs the front-runner when we're thinking about the medicines that are being developed up cannabinoids they're being divided up not just about letting but for some other indications as well so where are we with CBD what's the imminence saying so if you're going to go and look at all the studies every time the world if the drug company went and got those studies and then took them to the TGA so we want to license this drug you know how where they up to and basically the data we have focus of what the men must I'll say in a moment but most of the studies to date have been what we call Survey Research so or you know studies or k-series so the first published study looking at CBD based products was actually conducted by a scientist who also was a mother with a child with epilepsy so she had her own personal interest in doing this research and it was a well conducted he'll study of nineteen families the children with severe epilepsy taking CBD enriched cannabis extract so these would not necessarily wasn't one medicine these were using the various products that are available in the American market markets in the first moment and this is whatever this what she reported to children became seizure free over nineteen and eight had a marked reduction so over half the children you know the parents were you know and the the science is doing the research we're having tournaments a book that was a significant improvement in Afghan over half the children but it didn't work for all the children now was that a one-off or what else and we see what happened in Colorado with the legalization of of cannabis in the last year one of the things that happened was a huge influx from families from all over America with children with epilepsy who weren't able to source medicines in their own jurisdiction their own states all converged into Colorado as soon as the laws got changed so the hospital in Colorado went from you know having five kids with with dravot's to all of a sudden being inundated with dozens of 12 children and fans from all across the country so they weren't ready for a day one when you do sort of a fancy research designs and so forth but what they did do was just document well you know what's been the experience of the families who are turning out and using the products that they can buy over-the-counter in Colorado so many of these products of the products such as Charlotte's Web they're some of you may have heard of on the media so and and have to emphasize none of these were prescribed medicines these were all what we call inverse of the the extracts that are available over-the-counter in in America and basically what they found that was that the what the doctors were describing there in conversations with the children with her family sorry that about a third of the children had a marked reduction by more than 50% there's about 1 in 3 if you in that 1 in 3 group then that's clearly a huge advantage but still it was 2 in 3 did not have that 50% change which often in epilepsy language is that kind of has something worked or not when they did to make a gs5 anywhere able to do each easing 8 children before their side of the medicine again after the medicine there were no differences when the energies that they would have to report and this one sorry now this is interesting because this is the an open moment safety study of epidemics so battalions of medicine the GWAC many based medicine energy being virtually wev producing the going to trials they have done an open Mabel safety study which means no randomization everyone got the medicine and they'll treated as best as they could by the doctors treating them 137 patients who've got at least 12 weeks of the of the epidemics and overall those are mean median reductions have about of around 54 percent and the kind of feedback we've heard from the from the people running the research is around a third of the patients have a 50% reduction so again what that tells us is it's gonna work for some people but not for everyone now where are we up to in terms of the evidence for epilepsy if a company went to Morrow to licensure to the TGA and in summary basically there's a thing in medicine called the Cochrane review which is basically but if you ever want to know where we up to state of the art for the for the world conducted studies you go to a Cochrane review and they have a methodology in which they use for every medical condition so you can do a couple review on any condition and basically what's the science tells today and they only look at the randomized control trials they're not interested in the open labor studies you know that the k-series and so forth they they are strictly limited to our cities because that's kind of information into licensing medicine and this is their conclusion the conclusion is the data isn't there at the moment but there are two large trials of CVD currently underway in the u.s. of the other dialects product and we expect these studies to be reporting by early to mid next year and and at the moment no one knows what this studies are showing so you may hear from people are the studies in the mode that randomised trials are showing no one knows they say the blind that no one has until they actually you know unwind the study at the end of the project so we're waiting to see just what you know will the CBD reach the the standard that then groups such as the FDA and America the TGA here in Australia within to her and say you know we've got the data to tell us they know that we can actually sew around you know complete the whole circle and then license the medicine is any cannabinoid product licensed for epilepsy because you'll hear a lot of things about art it's it's licensed in America and it's licensed in Europe there is no cannabinoid product licensed anywhere in the world by a medical regulator for the indication of epilepsy at this point in time what is happening in the u.s. is kind of a sort of a bit of a loophole where in the u.s. hemp oil is legal so as I just pointed out you can grow him with high CBD you can even fortify it and put other things in it other cannabinoids like fall in some extra CBD or thrown in some other cannabinoids and it's legal in the US and it's legal in most parts of Europe so many of these products that are being sold by the Americans such as Charlotte's Web and a bunch of other ones are not licensed as pharmaceutical medicinal products they are actually sold as a food in Australia we actually there's an application at the moment about should hemp seed oil should hemp oil be a bulb in Australia as a food so that's currently working through this way to give you an issue that I mean that foods don't get regulated particularly well their food they're not medicine so a recent study done by the FDA where they went and just got 18 samples from around the u.s. from companies that were saying you know selling their products as CBD rich products food that CBD rich and then it's basically analyze them and found that 14 of those 18 products actually have mostly been due unit or so negligible there actually is kind you know you know not not know and why because they don't have to regulate because it's a food it's not a medicine and some of them unfortunately actually had high THC levels in there so what are we doing in New South Wales and having our research of gender announced today fit in with where we moving towards so remember the main medication that that around the world is CBD it's not the only one that we're interested in so you know for example some of the products been being sold in Australia I'm not necessarily high CBD products there's some other cannabinoids in there as well so we are proposing to do the CBD study in Australia because by the time we set that up the Americans would be reporting it would be kind of a waste of time and it would be a little bit unethical to actually subject patients to in a study when the Americans are about to reveal those findings by the time we set those settings up so in Australia New South Wales the main study that of an investigational product is see me TV and that's the one that especially the animal models the animal research is telling us geez accents of the next most promising cannabinoid coming out of the lab and where's that kind of you need more it could work better than CBD but certainly know we just saw before only maybe a third to half of the children actually respond to CBD based products so what are you going to do with the other half to two thirds you know is that just is that it if you give up I will assume it did work well no and that's why in many respects what we're doing is were at the beginning of this journey same a day we'll have much better information within 12 18 months and then the Australian trials will be the first ones running his Sabre debate there is Korea's study have seen the underway in the US for adults with epilepsy with focal epilepsy geography obviously there as as a minister Jared announced we also are in certain implementation trials of epidemics so should it work should we make them demonstrated works then the trick is how to be fast-tracked into Australia but you can hear from what I'm saying these are all 12 18 months away before they're available either as what the trials might start a little bit earlier but before saving day that evidence was through and you know we're talking about at least 12 months away so what happens in the meantime so does that mean you can do nothing until there and one of those options one option is there's a whole this hundreds if not thousands we don't quite know there are hundreds of families come in Australia they're turning to producers of cannabis products that are illegal but as we've heard today there are families doing it now we also understand that there you know there aren't but the police have really given up the challenge of trying to prosecute but we all know at the same time that's not a satisfactory position where we I mean Michelle just described you know Sunday's enticingly afternoon but because it's an illicit substance she can't have it given by the school nurse like every other kid having their asthma med if you are taking these artisanal products and you end up in hospital the doctors the nurses probably want that you take the medicine because it's not allowed within the hospital because it's not a medicine so there's all these barriers and those problems with this current state of play uncertainty in the products you know there are some reputable you know artisanal producers out there but you know if you it's it's hard to standardize these products time after time after time without having the the big word laboratories so we can keep doing what you know families can keep resorting to the to their current options there is also a lot of people are doing we'll get camera self-compassionate access programs we shall spoke about the special access program we would love to set up a special access program the difficulty is most of the manufacturers in the u.s. who make this MMD products do not want to engage with a medical medicinal regulatory framework injures the whole equation for them back home and also there actually it's illegal for them to export a cannabinoid based product from the US so there's all these issues and barriers of it's not just as easy as ringing up Lena the Stanley Brothers in Colorado and say can you ship over some Charlotte's Web because we want to start a trial we've tried that we haven't given up but you know there's work underway saying can we make these frameworks work clinical trials are probably the easiest way and it is possible to set up a safety study of a cover of a medicine that does not require randomised trials and so forth it is possible to do again we just need to be able to have a product which is stable hasn't got fungicides hasn't gotten laid in it hasn't got alcohol hasn't got a whole range of things that you know stable they open actually just get it through a clinical trial process and we're keen to look at that how that might be possible to do so we haven't given up hope the other thing we are doing here in Australia is actually setting up the Pelican project the Perkin project is a Michigan vampire as it's in the unified leadership also working with epilepsy action Australia the consumers and also some of the leading neurologists from New South Wales and Victoria because we actually want to explore just what is the experience of families that are using medicinal cannabis products for epilepsy because we've heard some stories but there's a lot of other stories out there it's important that we actually understand what these fans are going through what's the decision-making processes because we want to talk not just of the families that have gone down this track who are using and cannabinoids we also want to talk to the families that have used the cannabinoids and no longer are because again it doesn't work for everyone and we want to understand from them so what happened you know why don't you try at what point in time did you find this thickness isn't quite right for us and we also want to talk to families who never have used cannabinoids and to try to understand so what are the issues for you guys like what is it that you would need to understand whether or not you should be making this leap forward or not the other thing we want to do is actually go and test some of the products so we also want families who are using their products actually give a sample so we can do the lab analysis to see just what is in these products that different families are using because again because of the illicit nature of cannabis in this country is actually not legally possible for a manufacturer to take it to the lab or for a family member to take their sample to the lab and have it legally analyzed so you know that's just because cannabis has been illegal so infection going on all these exemptions to do this research and we're working through those processes we are ready to be able to get this up and running there's a whole bunch of all these regulatory issues we need to get through solid we all want to you know handle cannabis products legally this so the families don't end up in trouble that we don't end up in trouble and so forth and we only hopefully should be up having that been running and every rep see action Australia will be one Avenue to find out about when is that something really to start I think it probably smoking longer than I should it sorry we summers get carried away when we talk about these things and to see why but if there is time I'm more than happy to feel questions that are thinking and also likewise I think you've got questions of science or process you know I'm sure how when you got Carroll but wait or in mention that because the endocannabinoid system is so new it's not even talked about in medical school in fact it's been known about for 20 years and has been left off the curriculum for fear of broadening the minds of those in it do you think the lives of the children in a group especially and many other groups of illnesses are too important to be left in the hands of canvas deniers until their work back to 20 years remember our first application to grow CBD was in 1990 and we waited 25 years in this country they have the temerity to talk about us being at the forefront we're in the backwater of science and politics and compassion so why should the doctors control simply natales bill was shot down by Turnbull remember a merchant banker and the control of the cannabis has gone to the federal Department of Health rather than independent body can you see that as a positive step so if you go back seven questions in that I'll try to go through the real ones I can remember so it's a really it's not a new system it's been around since rats were were born and wrapped into CC plus so so the cannabinoid that we are all manufacturing cannabinoids as we see here today so we're all actually making your own cannabinoids you may or may not know that that we're all kind of breaking the law as we sit here as far as personally I think that it's a system that's very rapidly evolving in terms of our knowledge and you know having taught university courses over decades it tends to you don't get your own slight minor give the same lecture a year after year after year so it's kind of a legacy thing in a way that a very good medical educator will keep up-to-date with this but the reason we are up-to-date is that we get in a plane and we go to the International cannabinoid Research Society the International Association for cannabinoids invasive you have to work really hard so I don't think it's a conspiracy theory I think is in the education area I think when it comes to the library initiative one of our major principles as I've mentioned education particularly medical but I actually think you already is Landis child is receiving CV day because he thought the money to come by but with that thirty million dollars with one percent of that we could effectively treat much more than half of the intractable epilepsy sufferers and do the first part we can screen out the CBD non reset non-responders I'm getting about three and ten CBD non-responders they could be straight line to your CV DV group there if we're living in a real world and not having some I think everyone recognizes yeah they feel that at the moment we're now at a watershed for things are really starting to happen I mean today I was something at a federal level I really think any many measurement even became 12 months ago with weekly where we are you in Australia show you men on this case you know missing the critical tip and the question the critical question was Richard Di Natale provide provided a bill for a creation of an independent office of medical cannabis Turnbull the merchant bankers shot that down and grab control of medical cannabis to the federal Department oh hang on but I think very well that confident health has twice blocked our application even on MC foods going back to 2000 in fact if I were just wandering out but very conscious that other people may has questions and we can't revisit the past and change the past so can we ask if anyone else has questions mom always has CBB years in it which is the precursor of CB and email as well as tears yeah I take your point th CA has a lot of potential I think as that I think involves but it's completely unloving iMovie putting it through our screening process as I described as one of our top priorities we think it's a very very exciting molecules Melun psychoactive the one difficulty would th see if you brought it all into market is if you heated above 160 degrees you get a pure THC and you know just what every teenager in the land mature would learn that in the internet with with an updated release and then so you do have regulatory hurdles to cross with THC which which trouble of students no it's because THCA hasn't been studied so I have got another Christians another question here I think we've there's a library initiative even so Lambert initiative if you go to the website or the University of Sydney you'll see a general inquiries email for the contact part if you I think I've bought order suggestiveness that we that you just log your interest in being part of email and we'd love to have everyone who's in is interested in participating I mean we think it's an amazing opportunity with epilepsy action in Australia to do an excellent study I mean there's been surveys done in the past this one will be different because it will include chemical analysis for those people who are actually using products we can screen for 12 maybe 15 different cannabinoids how much really exciting there is that it actually helps us in our therapeutic mission because if your child is responding really well to a particular cannabinoid medication that we know it contains for example howevers of THC a or cv that we can start to look at the therapeutic benefits of different cannabinoid mixtures there's more than 2,000 different strains of cannabis and they all have wildly different levels of cannabinoids and terpenoids so it's everything from many years ago and I'm glad I did know what they're actually getting in ordering this so for them to be able to help with your research currently until the federal offense actually until we do you have any timeframe of when you think that change which happens to those families who want to get on so that's what we're doing about how we work through the the legal process and it's possible we just need to get this through ethics committees and then know how the government you've asked the Commission and be able to have the samples store them move them and then we also have to go through the ethics issues around and how we work with families who have got the product so so we're just gonna sort out some of the science regulatory stuff which is kind of taking us now we said so willingness as I said from government in this area they're interested in study they'll work with us to try and find a way that there's a complex ethical issues but we can see a way around it and today because it's all state-based laws so today we've been working in South Wales health but we are also keen making the Queensland Health you see we're not we can extend extend the project beyond yourself one note that a lot of the other states Queensland just announced rates ago so it's easy to state doing their own how do you run away from this question great that with Jenny the politicians response would have been how do you run away from the question medical cannabis and now there's there's there's an understanding that this issue is is relevant and the community understands that I think that's when he what's happened we've reached that tipping point where now is kind of the convergence of the science when you saw human a proposed things and what's the data tell us that's all stuff that's been written about for the first time in the last four months I mean we don't have a lot of good studies going back twenty thirty years around CBD networks this is so the science is new the the advocacy is new you know something that the politicians thing their head around is new so I think what we're seeing you know in the next two or three years will be major changes and I think you know people with such as the end of the Bennett campaigning for years and not being able and you know their voices heard I think that finally there's now you know there's there's progress is like into the tunnel as for how it's going to roll out they still this there's a lot more work to do all we know is that the Commonwealth recently so the one thing that they said they will do is change the act the narcotics act that will allow us to grow cannabis for a pharmaceutical industry without breaking the UN attention why does that matter the UN Convention because men feel bright whenever we want another country's head it matters because we've got a big opium poppy industry in Australia and if we reach the UN Convention on growing cannabis we don't do that properly that jeopardizes our very me opium poppy industry so you can see why the politicians and farmers want to make sure that's going to gun properly so then has something made and that's about it we actually don't know exactly where are we going to be in two three and four years time are we going moon towards an Americanized model which is kind of inverted commas medical cannabis it's really you know cannibal there's not much not much many Polly what's going on in the US you know doctors aren't involved doctors don't prescribe largely on the big in the bigger jurisdictions do we get any European model which is much more doctors are involved the medicines are more tightly controlled their standard there's regulations around what can be grown and sold and so forth so they're the debates I think we're kind of having over the next couple of years until we've bought McKesson them for how the community can along with that finger NATO's have also haven't I'm saying where do we want to be in five years time and how do you get there but recognizing it for some day the five years is too long to wait and so what are you set up in the interim but the interim isn't necessarily where you want to end up if that makes it questionable it wasn't it lets me best safety CBD is incredibly safe medications other games Saturday more the main hazards that I can see very high doses might sedate a little bit but not as much as a retro clovers a lot of girls remember the man's eyes not nothing I mean probably the main hazard is that it tends to interact a liver level with other medications so if you're on CBB if they're also taking value committee that you can modify a peg leg usually in an upwards direction so you have to really force the blood levels of a standard I'm thinking false indications quite carefully if you go just on normal phone you know that here there are something you know on that floor there are a few diabetic sighs you can pulse it interaction studies that have shown levels of different anticonvulsant medications going off with everyday lives it's just something to be aware of it's not it's not a party store or part of it yourself or do something she's a Fed like so if you had say they they you know manufactured Jimmy Mane's extracted from a plant and it's a month of a proverb you know process whereby units being grown under the conditions that you want a medicine to be grown in so that it doesn't have you know horrible fungicides and other kinds of things and so this is looking collect they called GAAP good agricultural practice and so you know can we grow it well you know that to the standards we expect from before future medicine and then GMP wood manufacturing with practice which is that can you then actually make sure that all the extraction and all the process is going to end up you know that that's done properly they're not going to end up with you know heavy metals ethanol a whole bunch of other stuff that you know potentially could do without ideally but it can also make it the lab which is another four points it you could we've got synthetic salinity we can make it in our chemistry department is quite you can take lemon even which is the smell of lemons I do a bit of a chemical modification if you got the medicine that's fine I'm sorry anyone's kind of dispute you know is how we make sure that when you until we have heavy medicines just just chug Google Sites applause - two more questions about two hands I've got three hands I'm okay can we keep it reasonably short because then there's an epilepsy action board meeting that has to happen right at the back first of all there's one of things Excel my advice would be to get ourself something big so hard and some good dance I was going to say I'm wondering whether on the individual we can't be willing to have a chat I've got this feeling that some this girls might not get out of here can I quickly though the general principle because this is a common issue that comes up so I've got you know I've me or my friend of mine my son my daughter my cousin whatever will it work for me now that how do you understand your interpret you research that we produce because what the research will say sixty percent of people in this group got there that can be at a forty percent in that group so they will say drug eight work better than drug B as a on a hold as a general 60 versus forty days better than B but if your parent that forty percent that beam drug B worked for as far as you're concerned it worked so at the end of the day randomised trials both big studies are important to get drugs licensed at the end of the day will it work for you is only one market knowing that is that when you take the medicine is it going to heaven and you know is it going to be improve the quality of your life so that's that always the complexity the studies are important they give us a guide that allows the talk in terms of chances are probability is you know but at the end of the day until you try medicine and for all medicines until you try it yet you won't know what are the side effects for me did it work for me within all recent different works for children okay I prefer better nature ideally to call this to a hold I hope you will agree this has been an amazing session when I asked the fellows here when I when I actually asked Nicky and Jonathan David would you like to speak they said yes all four of us would like to speak and we can do it for hours so having said that perhaps a couple of you might like to that you had questions outstanding might like to come and have a wound because we do need to move out of the room just a couple of things to finish up the minister's office has let us now know that they've now set live a medicinal cannabis hotline for New South Wales one eight hundred to one seven two five seven will actually put that on our Facebook page as well and keep everybody aware of that but that's now live it's certainly one eight hundred two one seven two five seven the other thing is epilepsy action Australia publishes a fairly regular newsletter up and maintain any deed see am if you haven't registered for it do just contact us any way you would normally Facebook email phone and we'll be making sure that people are kept up-to-date with what's happening again you know thank you thank you to all of the speakers I think you know unique in fascinating stuff and we're just so happy to be working with you on it it's a it's a true privilege Michelle your religion you know what we think of you you're an absolute legend and a courageous lady we are caring of the families who are already using medicinal cannabis and we're also you know caring for those families who haven't yet and we hope to serve you in whichever way we can thank you for coming today and will certainly be staying in touch"

sKjFOSD4S-8,Medicinal Cannabis and GPs - Alex Wodak,2015-07-08T01:39:49Z,hi everybody so I'm going to talk about the overall context because it's very important with me thinking about medicinal cannabis to place it into a bigger framework I'll give you something about some information about the evidence that medicinal cannabis is effective talked a bit about its safety cost-effectiveness the three things that will always look at any medical intervention these days we want to know whether it's effective safe and cost-effective say something about options for administration roles of general practitioners in Australia because no doubt about it general practitioners in this as in every other area of our health care service are going to be the front line and then say make a few remarks about whether there is arisen to crossover between medicinal and recreational cannabis and then a few concluding remarks well the context of this issue medicinal cannabis is that there's been a fierce debate as I'm sure you've all noticed between a rather punitive approach to drug policy and drug law reform harm reduction human rights that that kind of thing and it was Aeschylus often attributed to George Orwell but it's Aeschylus who said all those years ago in ancient Greece in war truth is the first casualty and it's been unfortunately truth has been a casualty of the debate about medicinal cannabis and also about recreational cannabis frankly it's hard to know who you can believe because on both sides there's clearly been inflation of problems and other people have been deflating problems so very hard to find anybody who's so objective and impartial and it's your good fortune this afternoon to have it straight from the source everything I'm going to tell you is going to be completely objective and impartial he is here's an example of the context that you're in now that the this is a quote from the the spokeswoman for the national institute of drug abuse which is an arm of the US government and this is quoted in new york times and national institute of drug abuse is pretty important in the world of illicit drug policy it funds more than eighty percent of the research done in the world on illicit drugs but because it's part of the US government it's not really a scientific organization it's really a political organization organization which happens to employ scientists not really a scientific organization here's why i say that here's the quote as the National Institute on Drug Abuse our focus is primarily on the negative consequences of marijuana use we generally do not fund research focused on the potential beneficial medical aspects of marijuana so there she is she's saying you know here's our bias and there's a huge barrier throughout most of the Western world to getting research funding to getting studies on medicinal cannabis approved by the ethics committees and most important of all getting hold of the actual agent that you once might want to study so there's a big what's sometimes called the publication bias in this area that goes right back starts right back from the beginning funding fortunately as the war on drugs are starting to come under increasing criticism and rightly so these barriers are starting to be overcome now here's a very important statement from John Ehrlichman who some of you will remember us one of the Watergate conspirators during the Nixon presidency and he was played a central role in planning the Watergate conspiracy and then went to jail for his crimes and he also played less well-known central role in putting the idea of Richard Nixon to having a war on drugs so that Nixon could get back in this 1972 elections which he won partly because of the war on drugs which he won by winning a 49 out of 50 states landslide so Ehrlichman said the line against the use of dangerous drugs is now drawn on this side of marijuana if we move the line to the other side and accept the use of this drug how can we draw the line against other illegal drugs so it's very clear that John Ehrlichman realized that once marijuana goes the whole war on drugs is up for discussion he is Richard Nixon speaking in the oval office at three minutes past ten in the morning of May the 26th we know this thanks to the Watergate tapes and he said you know it's a funny thing every one of the bastards that are out for legalizing marijuana it's Jewish what the Christ doesn't matter with the Jews Bob talking to Bob Haldeman what's the matter with them I suppose it's because most of them are psychiatrists now I should declare a conflict of interest I'm not a practicing Jew but I'm Jewish descent but at least I'm not a psychiatrist so my advice to you terms of this context be skeptical of everything everybody says including me especially when talking people are talking about cannabis medicinal or recreational let's look at the evidence for effectiveness and this comes from a study published you'll see the citation at the bottom of the slide you can check it out yourself and this looked at over a hundred randomized controlled trials studies of medicinal cannabis and found evidence that eighty found 82 were favorable to medicinal cannabis nine were unfavorable so nine of these studies for spasticity and disseminated sclerosis were favorable three were unfavorable and you can see for chemotherapy-induced nausea vomiting forty favorable one unfavorable HIV AIDS related cachexia seven favorable none unfavorable cancer-related cachexia three and 0 chronic neuropathic pain 12 and two other chronic pain eleven and two it's not just scientific author's writing on their own or writing with a couple of co-authors we've had a number of expert reviews concluding that medicinal cannabis is effective including the Select Committee on science and technology in the UK House of Lords way back in nineteen ninety-seven hardly a group that you would think our group of Trotskyite nimbin hippies nevertheless back how almost 20 years ago concluding that missile cannabis works the USA Institute of Medicine a very prestigious organization in the American system something like our NHMRC then the American Medical Association did a comprehensive review of the evidence in 2009 and changed their position calling for cannabis to be removed from schedule one in the United States federal system schedule 1 and the in that system means no recognized medicinal benefit and highly dangerous in schedule two of the same schedule is cocaine so according to the US federal system marijuana is more dangerous and less effective less useful medically than cocaine ok so my conclusions are that medicinal cannabis is useful for relieving distressing symptoms when conventional agents have failed so it's not as far as we know a first-line drug but it's a useful second line drug and those conventional agents don't always work as you will know it so if grandma or grandpa has got terrible distressing symptoms and all the usual agents haven't worked why on earth can't we use medicinal cannabis well now at long last we're in sight that that's actually going to start happening in Australia there is laboratory and animal evidence that medicinal cannabis might be curative but so far we haven't had long-term trials in humans and it may be that in future someone giving this talk in 10 or 15 years might say that medicinal cannabis is curative but at the moment I don't think we have those data now when we're starting to talk about safety I think the first point should be where should the benefit of doubt be placed and I think the benefit of doubt should be the same for medicinal cannabis as it is for every other drug and that is really since the thalidomide disaster catastrophe that happen in Western medicine almost half a century ago we've taken the view that all new medicines are ineffective and unsafe until proven otherwise so the starting position should be the medicinal cannabis is unsafe that should be the starting position and then we change our view if evidence comes out that it's actually quite safe now fortunately they've been some careful studies where cannabis has been used medicinally that is regulated forms of the drug have been used under close supervision as opposed to black market use of recreational cannabis used in a kind of medical context so in these kind of dissonance studies the sighted here's an author this is an opinion from a well-established Journal saying side effects were modest with only ten percent of patients choosing to discontinue their treatment a relatively low proportion now many of the comments you will see about the adverse events of recreational of many many the comments you will see about the safety measures animas are based on adverse events which said to occur in association with recreational cannabis I have a real problem with this you'd regard it as nonsense if somebody were to say to you look how bad regulated alcohol is when we look at the side effects of bootleg liquor supplied by Al Capone it was terrible so therefore regulated alcohol must be the same that is of obviously nonsense we have to compare like with like and so the data we should be drawing on and only drawing on our studies of recreational sorry studies of regulated medicinal cannabis nevertheless a lot of commentators infer the safety or otherwise of medicinal cannabis from studies of recreational cannabis also we need to compare the adverse events of medicinal canvas with the adverse events that occur with no treatment where people we know have distressing symptoms and we also need to compare the adverse events with of medicinal cannabis with the adverse events of the conventional treatments and you'll find that very few people provide those very few of the commentators provide those kinds of caveats and I think it's fair to say that while there are some physical health and mental health concerns about cannabis as there are with most powerful psychoactive drugs there's been a exaggeration of these adverse events and in my view often a willful exaggeration in order to preserve the status quo drug policy cost effectiveness now this is in a health care system which is financially stretched as ours is and will increasingly be stretched this is the important question is worth it we don't have any data as yet there's only one approved cannabinoid in Australia at the moment side of X and that's likely to cost five hundred dollars a month and you have to remember that the patient population likely to need medicinal cannabis will probably have been sick for some time and will have depleted a lot of their meager savings so cost effectiveness is very important for this population I can't see federal or state or territory governments rushing to subsidize medicinal cannabis botanical cannabis is likely to be much cheaper than nibix animals Sativex and it may be better now for those of you who haven't heard about side effects sound effects as a trade name for a product generic name is in the big smiles which is prepared from a botanical cannabis in carefully and rigorously controlled conditions so we have achieved or GW Pharmaceuticals has achieved product consistency the product they produce in 2015 will be the same product that they produced three years ago and in three years time they've managed through highly scientific processes to maintain consistency of the cannabis that they produced it's grown under identical very carefully monitored conditions and it's approved in Australia for one condition specificity due to multiple sclerosis getting approval for that is extremely difficult conditions are very stringent and the approval is only for short term then the doctor has to apply again and even if you manage to get approval getting the drug from GW pharmaceuticals agent in Australia Novartis is is quite a challenge so it's available in theory but in practice it's not really available and even if it was available it's the most patients unaffordable and the prices are likely to remain high for some time because the company GW Pharmaceuticals masters tens of millions of dollars getting their product to this stage and unless there's a competitor around I can't see them dropping their price quickly so the conventional medicines are much more expensive also that competing with medicinal cannabis are much more expensive than medicine cannabis a dancer on a very useful agent in controlling severe nausea and vomiting in the context of cancer chemotherapy i think is about five hundred dollars a day and the patient is required to have an intravenous drip therefore has to stay in hospital and almost certainly now you just imagine grandpa grandma with not too many days left on planet earth given the choice of staying an extra day in hospital to have a drip with a dancer drawn in or staying at home and playing with the grandkids and having a few puffs sauna inhaler breathing in cannabis vapor what do you think grandma or grandpa would prefer as well as the saving to the health care system so this may reduce hospitalization these are all uncertainties i'm pretty sure that medicinal cannabis is going to be more cost-effective than conventional medicines but we don't end more cost effective than Sativex that we don't really know yet sativex was evaluated in a research study in England recently in terms of whether the National Health Service in Britain should subsidize its costs for specialist needed multiple sclerosis and the conclusion was that it was the NHS had better things to do with its money now plenty of options for administration I I mentioned that the inhalation of cannabis vapor and this is a new technique that's come around in the last few years and the idea is that for most of us in this room for all of us probably in this room the idea of giving a patient a medicine that they meant to smoke is anathema maybe if somebody's got a few weeks or months to live and they determine that's the only way they're going to take it we have to accept that from time to time but I stopped us me included don't like that as a form of a patient taking a medicine well now cannabis can be gently heated to non Comber non-combustible temperatures in these special devices that are about the size of a fountain pen and then there are tabletop devices are a little bit bigger varying in price from $25 up to seven hundred dollars and the they gently heat the belief and release a vapor patient inhales the vapor we've had we've got a trial not me but other there's a trial currently going on and you new south wales hospital where this is being administered so shouldn't be a barrier to using this in hospitals even though hospitals have have got strict rules about not smoking and the the second stream absorption is very very low so these are this is really a new development the idea that cannabis has to be smoked as an idea of the past then we've got this oral mucosal spray which is i've mentioned before Sativex on the big smiles of generic name and it's got many attractive aspects unlike previous products previous therapeutic cannabinoids the sativex contains a number of different cannabinoids in it it's got THC and it's the tetrahydrocannabinol and it's also got cannabidiol in roughly equal proportions and it's got a few other cannabinoids as well and the reason it has this is because there is increasing evidence it's not not proof yet of what's called an entourage and that is the the guy who discovered discovered the biology of how cannabis works in the human brain an Israeli called mahal na mahal acum still around put forward a theory about 20 years ago that that the one of the features of the complicated pharmacology of cannabis is that with 60 different cannabinoids and terpenes and other agents as well that these have a synergistic effect now that's not proven yet but the idea is that the sum of the whole is greater than the sum of the parts that there's some synergism some action of all the different cannaboids working together and that's one of the arguments for using leaf cannabis rather than nibix moles which has only got some of those agents together well we still have a way to go and that isn't proven but that's the that's the second option we've got a whole range of different tablets I haven't given you those have enlisted those because they've been they're obsolete there was no demand for them and there was no demand for them not just in the Australian market but elsewhere because they didn't work and they didn't work because they are poorly absorbed they were taken orally so they swallowed and absorbed and and the absorption was very slow so tight raiding the right dose was next to impossible either the patient had an underdose which is meant they didn't get the therapeutic benefit or they had an overdose and they had an excess of the euphoric effects of cannabis which in this this age group very often in their 60s and 70s didn't appreciate it if they're in their 30s they might have appreciated it having said that though a slight overdose of cannabis and somebody who's going through cancer chemotherapy might not be a bad thing some patients undergoing the readers of cancer chemotherapy myton mind it too much if they made a little bit euphoric a little bit spaced out it might help them to to deal with the rigors of their ordeal there are also liquids we've got very little data that have had been hardly any Studies on that and I've already mentioned that in my view the smoke belief is shouldn't really even be considered except when we don't really have any of options because the patient demands it we don't know what the role of general practitioners is going are going to be in is going to be in it Australia because the we don't know what the system is going to look like in Australia they've been five parliamentary inquiries have been around away or have been completed in Australia Commonwealth a CT New South Wales Tasmania and Victoria and the Richard D natale leader of the Greens put forward a bill which is looks like it will get support from across the parties and is calling for an office of medicinal cannabis which i think is a great idea and the notion is that the role that the Therapeutic Goods Administration the TGA normally provides in regulating medicines in Australia that medicinal cannabis is just too far away from their usual way of working and also the field is so rapidly evolving now that it's a bit too much to ask the TGA to take this on so I think the idea of setting up an office of medicinal cannabis and then in 10 or 15 years time closing it down and pulling it back into TJ is I hope that's the way we do it but we don't know yet whether that's going to happen GPS are going to be that if anyone is going to disseminate information about medicinal cannabis to patients in Australia it'll be GPS you will be the first point of call of your patients asking for information of course though fossick around as patients do these days on the net some of the younger ones maybe but they'll certainly come to you and ask you what you think and I hope you follow up on this field and there will be more information coming at all the time but the only way we're going to get good coverage of medicinal cannabis in Australia as with every other field of medicine Australia is if we've got a strong base in primary health care in general practice now we hear a lot about medicinal cannabis and recreational cannabis as if they're one the same thing i want to remind you that we use a number of drugs which are very useful medicinally where their use their recreational use is strictly prohibited and if people are using these drugs and found their punished for doing so morphine cocaine ketamine and as Nicole mentioned last two sessions ago and dexamphetamine are all used medicinally and all of them are banned from recreational use so why we can't do that with medicinal cannabis beats me I think the weather question in other words should we use medicinal cannabis I think the the influence of recreational cannabis is irrelevant we should use it with the criteria for deciding whether or not we should use medicinal cannabis should be effectiveness safety and cost-effectiveness full stop whether how we use medicinal cannabis the the fact that about 2 million Australians are using recreational cannabis is highly relevant the reason for that is when any medicinal cannabis scheme starts in Australia it's likely to be very restricted people are going to be nervous people are going to be cautious I don't really have a problem with that personally I think it's good that medicine in Australia and other countries is conservative and cautious so by all means start small and if a case can be made for liberalizing then liberalize now the problem with that though is that two meters outside the doctor's office in other words out in the real world recreational cannabis is readily available ninety-four percent of Australians say that getting hold of hydroponic cannabis is easy or very easy ninety-four percent so if everyone on that side of the room goes to get a pizza and everyone in this side of the room tries to get recreational cannabis you guys will be back for those guys will be so and we have to remember that so if grandma or grandpa can't get medicinal cannabis because the rules are so restricted what's going to happen grandson will go out and get some recreational cannabis and say here grandpa I got you some of my stuff that's exactly what's going to happen so if you want your medicines in Australia to be regulated I have to confess I have a bias towards regulated medicines away from unregulated medicines that's my bias clear about it if you want if you also think medicine should be regulated then I hope we move quickly from a highly restricted scheme to fairly liberal one doesn't mean that we become a supply system for recreational cannabis but it does mean that we should we have to be realistic we can't ignore the real world so some conclusions be skeptical about medicinal cannabis as you are about everything else I think there's good evidence that medicinal cannabis is effective as the second-line treatment for symptoms distressing symptoms the side effects of medicinal cannabis are accepted by haven't given you all the data for that my colleagues and I wrote a paper in the medical journal of Australia I should have mentioned this here in the handout in December 2013 the first author is Laurie Mather and we've got a lot of data on safety in that paper it's called reintroducing medicinal cannabis it's called reintroducing medicinal cannabis because that's in fact what we are doing in Australia we used to have used to use cannabis medicinally Australia it was withdrawn nobody's really quite sure when or why and now it's coming back isn't back yet so we're reintroducing medicinal cannabis that was the title of the paper it's likely to be cost effective but we've got no data at present very little data and I think the inhalation of cannabis vapor is a very acceptable way of quickly of being able to titrate quickly so the patient has enough cannabis on board to relieve their symptoms but not more than they want to have which is the the critical point so think of it as equivalent to PCA patient-controlled analgesia revolutions come into medicine remember that with PCA when your patients are pressing the button for their analgesia remember that they actually use less morphine than when you are prescribing and the nurses dispensing it and they get better comfort so that should be the lesson for us with medicinal cannabis and final point as always GPS role in this will be critical if you guys do it well and I'm sure you will then we'll be very well off but if you guys aren't given a chance to do with will will be in trouble so thank you very much
k1MwbrT_KhA,Medical cannabis - Dr Pete Explains,2015-08-26T05:22:25Z,hi I'm dr. pate and you are here because you want to know about medicinal cannabis I'm a scientist who can help you sort the fluff from the fact maybe you've been wondering what exactly is medicinal cannabis is it just the same thing some people smoke to get high or is it different so let's kick off first up here's a quick overview of what cannabis is cannabis comes from the cannabis sativa plant just like this one it's dried leaves and flowers of marijuana the gummy stuff is hashish and the oil that comes from the hashish is cannabis oil simple so far right here's where it gets slightly tricky cannabis is made of 500 components 80 of them called cannabinoids cannabinoids are chemicals from the cannabis plant or other chemicals just like them made in human and animal bodies or man-made in labs the main active ingredient in cannabis is Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol but don't worry we'll just call it THC it's the main part that makes you high the amount of THC is different from plant to plant and we think THC in plants is much stronger than a few decades ago ok so that's the basics got it so medicinal cannabis it can mean a few things it might be the regular old cannabis sold on the street but used for therapeutic reasons it might be oil from the hashish or it might be a special preparation made in a pharmaceutical lab designed to make the most of the good stuff and get rid of the bad stuff mostly you'll hear more about the first two when it's on the news on TV most of our medicine is made in the lab that way we know what's in it we know it's been tested and we know each dose is the same when regular cannabis is used as medicine we can't be sure of these things we don't know how strong it is what mix of chemicals is in it and because of this doses will never be the same so how do we know how much to use good question these factors would make it difficult for a doctor to prescribe to a patient so in countries where medical cannabis is legal it's often not prescribed by a doctor like regular medicine what else do we really know first up we know that smoking the whole plant as a treatment for anything hasn't tested in gold standard human research that's the high quality credible kind of research secondly we do know that pharmaceutical preparations have been tested though not enough yet so what did they tell us patients with nausea vomiting and loss of appetite from HIV or cancer have had some relief with cannabis a pharmaceutical cannabis product Sativex is legal in some countries to treat spasticity in MS patients using cannabis to relieve glaucoma is short-lived and other treatments are better Sativex which doesn't make use as high has been used effectively to treat cannabis withdrawal making it easier to quit test using CBD for seizures in certain types of epilepsy are underway but more research is needed and there are no studies that show cannabis cures cancer so bottom line some good signs but there are some side effects and not enough research yet some countries have legalized cannabis or its derivatives for medical use Canada parts of the USA the Czech Republic France Israel and the Netherlands in Australia cannabis is illegal but there are moves to make it legal for medical purposes in some states to recap medicinal cannabis can mean different things to different people and more studies need to be done to get solid evidence well that's it check back for our next dr.

gKL8uurWYHY,"Medical Marijuana Legalization | Victoria, Australia",2015-10-19T04:15:55Z,so medicinal marijuana is going to be legalized in Victoria this is incredible news man specially because it signifies how much people are finally waking up especially to its legitimate medicinal use and since hear that it's gonna be available in a variety of forms including oils capsules sprays vaporizers liquids but should not be smoked because of the health dangers the commission set and that's fair enough because as soon as you heat up any plant matter it is going to be harmful for you lungs on some level right and that does not exclude marijuana so essentially that it like it will be regulated fair enough and that it's going to be targeted to ease the suffering of people with serious medical conditions and it's going to be first treat our children with severe epilepsy are going to be the first to be treated with Victorian grown medicinal cannabis in 2017 that's that's amazing because I don't know if you guys have seen stories of kids they have like hundreds of season seizures a day can't walk can hardly talk they're on dozens of really harmful pharmaceutical drugs and they just can't basically don't even have a life and obviously their parents lives are going to be miserable as well and then they get given this medicinal cannabis oil and they start to get results straight away their seizures started to dramatically decrease they started to get off the pharmaceutical drugs they're able to talk to walk to play to have a life it's so inspirational and I'm so glad that we're finally going to give these kids what they need man I remember two years ago in Australia those this kid who was having so many [ __ ] seizures that the parent even admitted on TV that she would probably die and this guy keeps a cannabis oil she gets cured doesn't have any seizures anymore very very very few I don't remember but she was able to have a life and this cannabis oil laughs the guy gets locked up in jail because it's against the law ridiculous hey you know what better late than never all right I'm actually really grateful for this and I'm grateful that Victoria my state is going to be leading this medicinal marijuana movement all right it'd be great if they legalized the whole thing but hey baby steps right at least it's something so good job is rally Oh once
Y0m2IjE9Vus,"Dr Andrew Katelaris in Nimbin, The Medical Cannabis Workshop, I.part",2015-09-03T20:47:46Z,"dr. Andrew catalyst have been a long been a fan of of Andrews he's been coming to nimbin for probably 20 years I think the doctors kicked you out of being a doctor didn't they because he refused to stop giving medical cannabis to people like being kicked out of the back of the ship actually yes yes ill speak much more frankly about it than me but he's been working on and researching and practicing with different medical cannabis potions for a long time now so really appreciating coming up from Sydney today to talk to us here you are done sit down there okay thank thanks for those kind words Michael's been in this business probably even longer than me that down all right now that's fine you're someone have taped it down now that's fine right okay most people here patients or carers of medical cannabis okay listen firstly we're just going to give you an overview of the theoretical basis of cannabis therapeutics and then we'll go on to more specific things about different methods of preparation and different conditions and things like that you must have heard by now about the endocannabinoid system now there's a lot of the woods and and terminology but none of it's very difficult so I'll go through it in simple terms because in concept it's a very simple system although in practice it's exceedingly subtle and complex so in the talk we're going to cover what is the endocannabinoid system where it is what it does and how we can manipulate it to assist in the restoration of good health okay as you see there the endocannabinoid system is described as an evolutionary conserved group of neuromodulatory lipids and their receptors having a diverse variety of physiological effects now when we say evolutionary conserved the endocannabinoid system is so important it appears to be present in all forms of life since the sea squirt about 60 million years ago so it's been there and because it's so essential it's there in all all the different forms of life or forms of animal life anyway now what r cannabinoids cannabinoids by definition are chemicals that interact with cannabis receptors and we'll talk about the receptors in a minute but there's three types of cannabinoids the endocannabinoids remember endo just in medicine just means inside EXO is outside and endo is inside so endocannabinoids and cannabinoids that are made within the body and act within the body so the endocannabinoids is two major ones an and amide which is a record donnell glycerin and arachidonic athearn olomide there the body's own cannabis activity the other one's a plant or the phyto cannabinoids are the ones that you get from the cannabis plant and as you'll come to see they're actually made from terpenes terpenes are the smelly parts of nature almost anything you smell in nature whether it's a rose or the herbs or pepper or anything like that contains volatile compounds called terpenes and the cannabis plant and perhaps one or two other plants in creation have learned to join the two terpenes together and then that becomes a cannabinoid so a cannabinoid is a diterpene but that's a photo cannabinoid or a plant based cannabinoid and then there's synthetic cannabinoids something like wind 55 and now there's a whole alphabet of synthetic drugs now bear in mind that all these three types are very very different chemically they nothing like each other chemically the intrinsic or endocannabinoid an and amide is chemically completely distinct from plant-based cannabis right the only thing they share in common is their ability to interact with the chem out the cannabis receptors okay all right endocannabinoid receptors now you've probably heard all about cb1 and cb2 that is a real simplification of the system at the moment now there's certainly a third what they call a g-protein coupled receptor so there's at least three receptors but it's likely there's going to be many more it is a very complex system and what I'll be giving you now is the current state of knowledge and it's unlikely that this current state will remain constant for the next couple of years and then we'll be dealing with in a much better understanding of the system so except that what I say today is provisional and the current state of knowledge but by no means the final state now in simple terms it used to be said cb1 receptors were in the brain and cb2 receptors were widely scattered in the immune system and the gut and things like that it used to be said that THC interacted with cb1 and cb2 CBD interacted with cb2 receptors it's nowhere near that straightforward it appears there cv 1 and 2 receptors on both sides of the brain and it certainly appears that the CV to that the cannabidiol of the cbn interacts in an unusual way with the receptors instead of binding directly to the cb1 receptor for instance it binds further into the receptor molecule itself but an alters the expression the THC does and that's how CBD actually changes the effect or modulates the effect of THC all right but we'll we'll leave that because it's far too complex a system to present the current state of knowledge as a whole lot of question marks about where they are and what they're doing okay but basically there is a whole series of cannabinoid receptors and we'll go into a bit more detail on the next slide they're especially the cb1 receptors are widely distributed in the brain and they're heavily distributed in those centers of the brain that have really crucial functions in the control of appetite in sexual desire in all sorts of things that interact with our day-to-day lives they all appear to be modulated by the endocannabinoid system in a way that yet not very clear and the big mystery of the endocannabinoid system is actually how it's rung and I'll go through that very shortly but that's that's what makes it quite fascinating but the message from this slide is that the endocannabinoid system is vitally involved in almost every aspect of human functioning okay okay what's the purpose of the endocannabinoid system broadly speaking its role is homeostasis homeostasis means keeping things in balance right we have our temperature well controlled we're not 40 degrees we're not 33 degrees we're 37 degrees we have our blood pressure control we have all these things controlled and it appears that the endocannabinoid system interacts with the bigger systems or the the outside systems it's a system with inner system and that's that's why it actually impacts on so many different disease states because it indirectly influences all the other the endocrine system the digestive system and the immune system are all modulated and controlled by the endo cannabinoid system this is fascinating because in the course of my sort of learning with this as we started treating children for life-threatening epilepsy what we found was some of their ancillary problems like their nasal allergies and their food intolerances and their eczema and things like that started to disappear which is very gratifying and still yet fully explain but it's certainly not a simple silver bullet or a magic bullet the way the allopathic doctor push a drug to have one effect and they're searching around trying to shoehorn the cannabis medicines into their magic bullet hypothesis so a company can then market it and make a lot of money but what they have to realize is that the endocannabinoid system is a vast system and interactions in one thing while perturbation will affect something else now it just go on from that world will leave that this is this is a diagram of a nerve now just imagine the nerve what they call presynaptic the synapse as you might know is where the nerves interact with each other where the axon of the down coming nerve interacts with the dendrite of the other one and things flow the normal way the physiology their body works is this presynaptic or the top the top part the the direction coming down like this produces vesicles which contain neurotransmitters those neurotransmitters jump across the synaptic cleft to the postsynaptic bowl there and they exert an effect but what the endocannabinoid system does I'll just get up and show you this something else so it's actually the system is running backwards right it doesn't mean it always performs a negative function of damping things down equally it can modulate things up so the mystery with cannabis and the endocannabinoid system is how it works right you've all heard of the endocrine system the endocrine system out of our pituitary which regulates our thyroid farmers you know that the gonads all these endocrine systems even though they're complicated in principle there really simple because we know when your thyroid hormone level goes up a suppressor is generated in the brain which then regulates down the thyroid and the thing moves up and down between narrow limits but the magic of the endocannabinoid system is no one really knows what's directing it now the endocannabinoids look at this they're produced as needed now no one that's thrown in because no one really knows what is calling the shots on the system but when you actually look at these things with advanced technology like air microscopes and things like that these endocannabinoids manifest out of a cell membrane make their actions filled and then disappear and it might all be over in a couple of seconds right the whole body is a very dynamic interplay nothing stands still in the body things are being made and broken down there giving responses there being up regulated or downregulated it's quite a complex interaction so they're produced as needed now this is where it gets mysterious I says just that next one and all to understand the endocannabinoid system properly you've got to understand what our cells are made of and the basic building block of ourselves is what they call the lipid bilayer right now it's a phospholipid through that phospholipid bilayer now break down the words I don't get frightened by the poly syllables phosphorus is the red dots or represented by the red dots they are water soluble material the lipids represented by the little store fear of what they call hydrophobic they don't like water and they take whatever they can to get away from water so when you have a polar molecule like a phospholipid right and you mix them together they self assemble to form a lipid bilayer now you can see why that's the case because the phosphorus goes out looking for water and the lipids hide from water and the only place they can hide is within the cell membrane so that is a very simple idea of a cell membrane but it belies the complexity of the whole system now the next one please the membrane in reality looks a lot more like that than that simple diagram and even this is a gross implication so when we talk about an endocannabinoid receptor what we mean is a protein structure that lives on either side of the cell membrane and is normally associated with a channel that runs through the membrane so say for instance it's activated it may lead to an influx or an hour flux of calcium or sodium or potassium or whatever that particular one regulates but that's how the endocannabinoid system actually impacts on the body it's the important thing though is where the anandamayi comes from and you're all aware that an and amide is the old sanskrit word for bliss right it was named by the I think Ralph mature llam because it did appear to be a molecule that induced a profound sense of bliss so that that's how it got its name but the fascinating thing about this unlike say thyroid hormone which is made in a gland or or you know testosterone or estrogen which are made in the ovaries or the testes we've got a discrete side here the ananda mine produces itself apparently out of the cell membrane when it's needed right but these are very very mysterious things to say because where is the intelligence we're conditioned to think our intelligence as a result of our brain working as a whole all those nerves together and all that learning and that's what gives us ideas but it appears in the endocannabinoid system we have an example of cellular intelligence right it's very much like the analogy of a be that knows how to build a hive and where to find flowers and how to direct and navigate without actually being told the cells appear to have an intrinsic intelligence that can regulate their interaction with each other and the endocannabinoid system unlike the endocrine system where an endocrine system will affect the whole body at once the endocannabinoid system is exquisitely specific and it works one cell at a time right so it's not sending an and amide out to the whole body it works locally on the next cell ok so is a little while ago I think it was actually at a Mardi grass one of the American speakers introduced the concept of an endocannabinoid deficiency syndrome and I must admit at the time I thought he was just being a bit clever but the more we actually look at it it does appear that a host of human diseases are the result of an endocannabinoid deficiency or an endocannabinoid dysfunction all right now this is what you can do about it there's no point in having a situation but we can actually manipulate these things the dietary intake of lipids influence a chemical makeup of your cell membrane so say for instance you eat McDonald's hamburgers and coca-cola is your standard diet for 20 years it's almost totally lacking in omega-3 and any of the better quality lipids so when your cell membranes are made up they can only be made up by what's put into the cake hole as a word and they end up with high levels of saturated fats they're not fluid electrically charged membranes they're basically just say your bags and from those cell membranes if you don't have the right lipids in them you can't manifest the right lipids out so the diet and what you eat has a profound effect on the function of the endocannabinoid system right so lipid deficiencies the key lipids and we'll be talking about the sources of those key lipids will have a profound effect on whether your endocannabinoid system works well in the same way if you're short of iodine or you're short of any other thing that system won't work will your endocannabinoid system runs on on quality lipids right not saturated trans fats they just can't do it right okay MC I hope you've all had experience with him see nutrition by now because if you haven't I'll spend the rest of the time here convincing you that you should right australia and new zealand are just the next one IP australia the politics of the hemp seed australia in new zealand are the only two countries on earth that have restrictions on the use of hemp seed as a human food right and the resistance in this country is profound as long ago as 2002 our colleague Phil Warner put in application a 362 tha's ants which is Food Standards Australia and New Zealand to have hemp seed recognized as a novel food but at that stage Howard was Prime Minister and Abbott was health minister now underwear so sick now but they knocked it back they wouldn't give it a consideration I can I let the water settle for a little while and in 2008 I made the next application 810 39 and a normal furs ants application should be dealt with in 18 months six years later that's in February of this year it came to the vote and guess who voted it down yeah it wasn't only Abbott unfortunately there seems to be an unholy alliance between people cross parties so we had that we had to get the support of six of the states right we got one Tazzy Baptists all right I don't know why there's such an agreement between liberal and labor when it comes to this issue but there does appear to be instructions coming from a higher level not to let it out of the bag the good news is we've heard recently that despite the fact that the federal government not back our application in February they're now looking to actually make some legislative change next year it's not as good as this year but it's better than nothing and it does look like will join the rest of the world in the near future the reason why it's so important to get hemp industry going to hemp seed industry going is it because it facilitates that the creation of heavy trees in this country we started agitating for industrial hemp in 1988 because was very clear then we had a problem with forestry erosion not to mention greenhouse effect and all the other problems that it be setting us they could all be significant impacted by having an major industrial hemp movement but to start it from a financial point of view if we have to build a temp industry that's going to make paper for instance you need something like two or three hundred million dollars to set up a mill and we just don't have access to that sort of capital at this stage so the critical thing was to get something modular like a hemp seed industry now with a hemp seed industry a person can make a decent income from 10 or 20 hectares so they don't need to to raise huge amounts of capital to get the industry started and then using that as a priming for the pump we can build up the area until we can actually do the large-scale industrial ones so having hemp seed legislation is critical because with increase a number of farmers planting a very very profitable crop yeah anyway there is a bit of light at the end of the tunnel but it's a shame that we've had to actually dip down so far boo but before the rest of the world for that to happen now I'm going to talk briefly about honor I'll just finish a little bit more on the head food there's a lot of use of hemp seed oil at the moment and people are taking it for its its presumed nutritional benefits and certainly it's a reasonably good oil but it's not a practice that I actually advocate right and this is why when you take the seed remember the whole seed that you saw before that has not only thirty percent oil thirty percent protein and a very rich mixture of what we call the cofactors that are needed to absorb omega-3 and utilize it into your brain and elsewhere it has large amounts of B vitamins and a lot of minerals zinc and magnesium specifically in very use and vitamin E in very useful quantities so when you eat hepsi nutrition in seed itself you're getting the oil in a pure form surrounded by its cofactors to assist in its utilization and uptake people started making hemp seed oil here because it wasn't permitted to eat the food but it was allowed to be used topically so the oil was actually a forced into production by the laws at the time now the problem with taking a seed and taking the oil to one side and leaving the protein cake on the other is you separate out the benefits of the plant of the planned right an oil that's taken away from its protein matrix very rapidly goes rancid and the better the quality or whether it's cheer or flax or hemp seal they go rancid very very quickly in a matter of weeks if they're not properly looked after whereas a seed has a shelf life at room temperature of a year and in the fridge of at least two years Brian so the purpose of not having oil as your primary intake of a hint is that it's separated from as cofactors and it's also very prone to rancid rancidity so you're doing yourself a disservice if you're taking hemp seed oil only and not hemp seed especially in the form of smoothies or any other form of incorporating it into your diet but certainly for children we're encouraging the parents and the carers to make smoothies and getting the kids away from now what is fairly poisoned dairy products and moving them onto a much more nutritious and beneficial brain building food okay the types of cannabis we're going to talk about various manners of extraction and various administrations thanks is ok I suppose everyone here is aware of the differences of the appearance of the differences between indica and sativa ok all right basically and I don't want to get into an argument about how to classify cannabis because every now and then someone comes up with a new scheme and all there is that this is simple but it's practical right as a rule the indica plants as you can see over there on the far ride a little squat plants that produce sure thick stems with short powermate leaves whereas a sativa tends to be a lot more range in ho chi hai growing the usual explanation for the effects is they say that the indica has a sedating or a body stone and the sativa has a stimulating or a headstone there's some truth in that but it really is a matter of individual usage and it's also influenced by the dose but there are perceptible differences in the psychotropic effect of an indica and sativa and often in therapeutics when it's available it's usually recommended that you may take a sativa drug during the day and an indica drug at night right so you can manipulate the differences of effects there's been a lot of attempts of explanations as to why these things are different some people get the explanation that the indica may have some CBD in it that's probably not true on the current population of Australian cannabis some years ago when we had actually access to high-quality analytical equipment at Southern Cross University we actually took 20 plants from around the place and looked at them and the Australian drug supply at that stage had zero CBD so was all THC so the effects the difference of effects between indica and sativa are probably explained by the differences in the terpenes which appear to modulate the psychotropic effect of the higher levels and whether they modulate the medical effects we've yet to find out but then there are indications that they do okay okay that's just the same for you again the little indica plant there and the the sativa plants there most of the drug supply in this country now is hybridized there's very few pure indica and pure sativa I was lucky two years ago to actually get access to pure indica and pure sativa from a very advanced seed bank and we grew them out in a farm and I was determined to do a chemical analysis of both of them and try and definitively work out the chemical basis of the differences unfortunately the helicopter found before they got to the analysis and that question is still up in the air which I wish the helicopters weren't orite what's the next one okay the reason for growing cannabis basically it's a resin factory all right the reason cannabis makes resin no one's really sure they say it's for protection against UV radiation it might repel insects we don't know other people say well the plant and humans co-evolved these are all speculative things but whatever it is the plant produces these resin bodies called trichomes in the highest density on the flowers of the female and that's really the reason for for growing the cannabis there is a movement around the place spearheaded by dr. Courtney in the United States that looks at juicing fresh cannabis leaves are not a massive adherent to that because I do feel that the medical effect of cannabis is a result of the cannabinoids and not some something in the fan leaves but little it take the next the next photo if you don't mind closer up you can see the terpenes a little mushroom shaped bodies in the case of CBD plants and this is interesting because we're going to be distributing cuttings from the cvd plans over this summer to give people better access because our attitude is we don't feel we own any plants or any varieties that we get access to they merely come through our hands so we can better distribute them but with the CBD plants especially most of the CBD appears to be generated in the last two weeks of their life so it's important not to pick them too early because you'll be short changing the production of CBD the evolution of the cannabis in these trichomes varies towards the end and it really just like any fruit off or other food it's only best when it ripens naturally okay now cannabinoid profiles this this isn't very clear but it's it's not that critical for the details because the information here is probably overreaching it's an American site where they claim to have pinned down into actions associated with individual cannabinoids I do feel this is overreaching because it's often based on just one or two experiments or no experiments at all as much an opinion as anything but the facts remain very clear that the different cannabinoids influence the overall effect now just to explain it very simply THC the major psychotropic cannabinoid is dramatically modulated when you add CBD to it all right THC in overdose has a range of side effects right I mean you can't provoke anxiety and can produce paranoia you can certainly exacerbate short-term memory deficit and things like that but when you mix some CBD with the part even if you smoke it in large doses you certainly have a psychotropic effect but you don't have what what we call being bent right you can still it's more a gentle stimulation and elevation of mood rather than having things sort of you know perceptions distorted so there is unequivocally an association between the different cannabinoids in terms of how they work and unfortunately because we live in a commercially driven world the company like GW Pharmaceuticals is now trying to pick out one or two something like th CV and say this is the one we're going to concentrate on for sale Pepsi or whatever particular treatment there it's not a way forward that I like I mean I may be a medical scientist but my very hard i'm also a herbalist and i really prefer that cannabis is dealt with as a herbal medicine rather than a cash cow for a pharmaceutical company which wants to pull it apart and use it in a least effective way okay decarboxylation is a concept you've got to get your head around it's not difficult in the plant cannabis any of the cannabinoids occur in the acid form as that if you remember from your high school days just see double O H an acid group is attached to the THC in a plan so it's referred to as THC a or THC acid when you heat the and especially by smoking that carboxyl group is removed and you have the full psychotropic effect of the THC right it's often said that THC a doesn't have psychotropic effect this isn't true but in the similar way to CBD it does have a mood elevating property it does have a perceptual change in inducing a change in perception but in the same way as just it doesn't have the same distorting effect on perceptions of time and and other things like that you can still get the flow of ideas the associations the lateral way of thinking THC a has a lot to recommend it right because it can be taken when needed in much higher doses and you can take THC and it's still an open question as to whether which one has the major therapeutic effect right whether it's TI SI o th CA but i resolve that dilemma in my own mind by saying it's horses for courses at some stage you actually have to interact the drug with the patient and whatever their particular disorder is and see how it goes right there's arguments for and against different things but there's no way outside of empirical trials that you can actually work out what's best for one individual person and their particular dysfunction at that time because remember everyone's endocannabinoid system is quite distinct as well as distinct as they are so decarboxylation there is a school of thought that says without they use the word activation without active activating the THC you don't get the therapeutic effect on certainly not of that view right and that's not been my experience even in the traditional THC roles of spasticity and pain relief what i've found is using THC a in the teacher the patients we've only use up recently and i'll go into the production and that soon the patients have been giving very very positive feedback so don't give up on THC i think there's a lot of therapeutic activity with very much fewer problems that you can get with high-dose THC therapy okay terpenes one of the fascinating things about cannabis remember we said that the the cannabinoids are diterpenes tutor beans have brought together the terpenes that are found in cannabis are also found in and anything else that smells they're found in mangoes in n roses what we sent in lavender in Oregon Oh all these terpenes can occur in the hemp plant and it's fascinating as to why why that is what such a range of terpenes but no one has really come to a sort of a clear philosophical understanding of how this all came about and why Canada's are such an unusual and unique planned but we'll just accept it for what it is okay now even though i said i prefer i see myself basically as a herbal doctor are still scientifically literate and i still appreciate the need for detailed scientific inquiry and a rational approach to what we do now there's several different ways of measuring cannabis in the old days by that i mean about the 1800s and cannabis was widely used in in the old days they used to give blocks of hash to beagle dogs and count how many times they fell over as a measure of how potent the hash work that was called a bioassay right i don't know but that's the way they did it we move forward a couple of hundred years and now we have hplc or high-performance liquid chromatography this is a beautiful analytical technique that gives you a very precise qualitative that means what cannabinoid it is and quantitative how much so when you look here you can see how they're labeled we've got CBD on the left we've got delta nine there in the middle and CBN on the far right and the height gives a measure of the quantity right so it's a very very useful technique in happier days and most people aren't aware we made really good progress back in 2002 and a group of activists myself and a group of activists here from Nippon actually got a license to grow drug cannabis as a preparation for medical and we had a wonderful bro shared over at Corinne died and we had Southern Cross University working on doing our analysis and everything was looking really rosy and mr. Carr's government seemed to pull the plug on that and we've gone nowhere sins unfortunately the current government is of the same view I've tried for three years to get Sydney Uni to do an analysis on the medicine that I'm using on sick children and after three years of constant nagging I'd have to say constant nagging they finally rang me up two months ago and said we're ready to do your samples bring them in so on the next train I was there with a briefcase full of samples but unfortunately Kerry chant the chief or the person imitating the chief health officer in New South Wales specifically prohibited Sydney Uni from doing any of the analysis from anyone that's not working within the system and that's that's actually a bit of a blow Kerry chant was the same person that came up to lismore and tried to sell the idea of fluoridating the water so you can see where she's up to scientifically they said okay when you don't have hplc we come back 70 years ago to what we call thin layer chromatography now this is a sort of access we've got now for testing and as you can see it's a little more in precise I suppose oh and what we've got here is only semi-quantitative it does very accurately set out you can see the THC dots you can see which are the plants at CBD because each of the different ones migrate through different through the medium or along the paper at different rates depending on their weight and their charge it's a reasonable thing if you want to take a herb and get an idea approx of what its THC and CBD ratio is you can use thin layer chromatography and what I say that in the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed man is king right it's better to have TLC than nothing although it's a long way from having a proper hplc the setup and the fact that there's a going hplc machine at Sydney Uni from which we're excluded is a source of ongoing anger for me and something that won't be resolved until it's resolved in our favor okay all right methods of extraction now listen at the moment cannabis chemistry is more like cannabis cookery and everyone's got their own particular view of how to do it and nothing I say today can be considered definitive or the last word on the subject right this is a learning experience for everyone and exists holding dogma excessively hard is as counterproductive as being completely ignorant right we get Dogma all the time old THC's good CBDs not good must be decarboxylated it must be this or you must do that there's a whole lot of stipulations that aren't really born out there sorry they're not really based on a solid factual factual basis so what I'm saying now is just what we're doing at the moment right and as the science develops and as we get access to better analysis that can guide us in what we do okay now that is a Sydney that's a pound of cannabis bought from the Sydney markets its twenty two percent it was a good good cannabis very very carefully trimmed but that costs the poor patient nearly four thousand dollars right and on top of a serious illness the cost of black market cannabis can be prohibitive okay next the the famous solvent extraction to make oil now firstly this isn't a new procedure by any means and I think it was someone up here last year that actually found an article in The Australian newspaper from 1857 which gave a recipe for making hemp oil which is not widely different from the recipe we're currently using so it's really back to the future remember in the 1800's the main drugs for pain and things are opium and cannabis right and yeah cannabis oil was widely used with a range of conditions now I'll just just go back to that one if you don't mind there's yeah there's a few issues with the oil right because it depends what solvent you use and there's there's the supporters have their views on whether you should use alcohol isopropyl or shall I or what else acetone most of the solvents are adequate in terms of their extraction and the big issue in people's minds are the residual solvents right and the argument is because alcohol is a theoretically a potable product it's better to use the alcohol than the isopropyl or the hexane now there's some merit in that argument but the problem is when people do alcohol extractions carelessly but you can bring out a lot from the plant that's not cannabinoids remember we just want cannabinoids but alcohol is water and lipid soluble so it brings out a lot of water-soluble things it dissolves a lot of the plant waxes and I've been shown oils that people call here's my oil and this thick disgusting black tar comes out and you really wonder how they can expect to get better on that sort of preparation the one thing that I've found quite useful if you're going to do a solvent extraction is to actually put the solvents in the herb in a freezer right I'm not against using isopropyl if that's the way it goes it's not my favorite and the time that I use isopropyl is if I luckily find myself out in the middle of a huge patch of pot and we actually washed the plans fresh in isopropyl in 20 litre buckets and then evaporate that often you can get a very beautiful oil the quality the oil can be basically assessed by its color right the beautiful gold and honey oil tends to be higher potency and a much greater purity than the black oils right because the black oils are made black by the oxidation of extraneous material because of careless extractor right doing it in the freezer at minus-4 degrees reduces the extraction of water-soluble but it doesn't prevent it okay for this is a sonicator it's also known as a jury cleaner and its most commonly used as a jury cleaner it really is just a heated metal box that can be vibrated of 40,000 cycles the second right so it's only it's used in the laboratories to assist in dot and dissolving things just imagine if you want to dissolve your sugar in your cup of tea you stir it with a spoon but you imagine you put it at 40,000 cycles a second it dissolves a lot quicker so to make the current medicine we're using in children the epileptic medicine for children we basically put a hundred grams of our chosen herb at the moment i'm using said seven which is a 15 to 1 CBD to THC ratio hundred grams of the herb and a liter of oil now i mostly use mct or medium chain triglycerides oil and for people who don't know coconut oil is made up of sixty percent medium chain triglycerides and forty percent long chain tight triglycerides now it's the long chain triglycerides that make the coconut oil go hard at room temperature right it also increases a metabolic energy needed to absorb it to absorb long-chain fats takes more metabolic energy and longer time than absorbing medium chain triglycerides and in fact mct or medium chain triglycerides are absorbed passively so if you just put them on your mucosa or even on your skin they're absorbed passively into the body and that's quite a useful way of actually formulating this form of preparation is useful to make a fairly low concentration so when I'm providing for say a three or four year old child we sonic ate this up but I usually soak it for 24 hours and during that 24 hours we sonicated three times just to make sure we have the maximum amount of extraction the beauty of doing it this way compared to solvents is very little extraneous stuff actually comes out because the water-soluble things aren't soluble in the oil like they are in the alcohol so you end up with a fairly pure extraction and we've actually verified this by analysis that was conducted overseas so the sonicator the reason why I actually developed it was I was trying to give the government something that was so far removed from any sort of suggestion of drug culture that that find it easier to go forward with it as a method of production but unfortunately it hasn't worked right because there is an ideological block this has got nothing to do with science or genuine concern it's a malicious ideological block to progress of natural medicines / allopathic medicines okay all right the other way is a dry ice resin extraction I'm a bit of a johnny-come-lately on this one even though it was all over the internet I hadn't heard about it till about six months ago when someone known someone actually brought a bag and says you've got to see this andrew i have to say i was pleasantly amazed at the dry ice extraction right now there are a few providers has everyone here familiar with that all i go through it no okay look you basically use bubble bags which are basically just some form of plastic bag with a membrane underneath of a known grid width and they vary from 23 microns up to about 120 microns and the idea is you get the pellets of dry eyes which are at minus eighty degrees and you put a carpet of the dry ice down the bottom of the bag and then a carpet of trim dry bud and I was told it works on fresh bud it definitely doesn't or it doesn't work very well so don't waste your time with that carefully trimmed dry bud and in another carpet of dry ice you leave it to chill down to minus eighty and then you simply agitate it shake it up and down onto a hard glass surface preferably and the gold and resin those trichomes that you saw comes fluttering down into a beautiful golden let's look at the next one says well it depends Oh God shall show you it depends what you want right I mean there's a degree of conceit the United States where some people only do 23 micron hash you know what we do I generally use about 45 because it's the best you can also do you start at the small one and you go up and as you 'extract it goes from a beautiful golden color which is just the trichomes but as you start to break up the plant itself then it turns green and you know you've passed the best right for our medical work we use 45 because we're getting most and not getting too much relief material so it's a trade-off between quality and quantity basically 23 you'll get a tiny amount of the best 45 you'll get a fair bit of good and it higher than that you get a lot of leaf thrown in so it's just a balance no because it depends how you agitate it you can end up with Lee thinner just by going too long even in a fine bag what we do we basically scalp it to get the trichomes so we don't agitate too hard just scalper take the best and then you may use what's left in a solvent extraction or a butane extraction right so say you've got a particularly sensitive child that you don't want to have anywhere near as solvent you use that for them and you use that free the topical use or an adult right so that way you don't have to be to quantitative about it you just taken the best but using the rest okay resin is fantastic i'm a fan it few provisos there if the herb is not very good right and by that i mean if it's significantly less and say ten percent of total cannabinoids you'll get a very disappointing result because unlike solvents it won't pull the cannabinoids out of a leaf material it'll only physically remove the trichomes so unless you've got really good bud really heavily resonated bud it's not worth doing this you'll be disappointed okay so it it's not a universal application and like I said before you can do it both ways you can take the resin for a particular sort of medicine and then use the rest you can use the rest in your biscuit making for instance so you don't have to waste anything it's just a way of separating it out physically okay okay methods of administration now basically you can eat it you can smoke her you can what we do the back door or you can do it topically now I've ingestion it can either be mucosal or gastric and there's a few securely of how you how you ingest it as to what actually happens right if you're eating it when you eat something it goes through your stomach through the intestine then it's picked up by the portal circulation and it goes through the liver when cannabis or THC specifically goes through the liver remember it's Delta 9 THC the body hydroxylation and it becomes 11 hydroxy THC which actually has more of a psychotropic effect than Delta 9 and a psychotropic effect that is of longer duration than Delta 9 so that explains at the that explains why eating it is more likely to lead to a green out or to an unexpected sort of exaggerated response down the track there is a delay sometimes up to two hours between the intake and the effect and that makes it hard to titrate eating does have a place for people who are on a stable dose and have worked that out over time so there is a place for that and there may be a place for the 11 hydroxy but it's a question of horses for courses and what suits people some people do very well on biscuits others won't do well at all and you just have to work that out mucosal objec- kozel absorption that's operating on the assumption that if something is absorbed passively through your mucosa it doesn't go through the liver but it goes directly into the systemic circulation so it's not subject to 11 hydroxylation and often the recommendation is that if you have an oil or a tincture you hold it in your mouth for as long as possible and that is the reason for doing that so it doesn't go through the liver and it's not generated into a more psychotropic effect inhalation I mean smoking is an interesting thing right there's a lot of do-gooder saying and Bob Carr being one of them or you know we can't have anyone smoking here you've got to breathe diesel fumes and all sorts of volatile poisons in the atmosphere but you can't voluntarily inhale a herb now the theory goes that because cannabis has four hundred more times tars and carcinogens and cigarettes it must be more dangerous now the only problem with that is that it's actually not true right now four years ago a professor of respiratory medicine in America Donald kashkin was tasked by the NIH the National Institute of Health to prove that cannabis cause lung cancer right this is this is how unbiased science worked in the United States anyway Donald tashgan was given a budget and said go out and show us that pot smoking causes cancer and he did a very very thorough study at least the man could be given credit for doing a thorough epidemiological study but the end of three years he published his results and he said not only does smoking cannabis not give your lung cancer but cannabis smokers have thirty percent less cancer generally so it appears to exert a protective effect now the NIH were furious and made tashgan take his paper off their website and luckily that provoked enough reaction from people and now it's back on and you can check what I say on the web so I'm not that fussed by smoking I mean I don't consider I smoked myself I don't consider it a big issue but it comes down to dulles and watch your smoke it with right there's a big issue with tobacco what can I say there that's balanced I actually smoke tobacco but I'm particularly sensitive about the quality of tobacco and anything that comes out of a tailor-made packet can't be called tobacco in the same ways of McDonald's food can't be called food right it's some bizarre parody of what used to be and remember they add things like ammonia to the tobacco to make the nicotine will rapidly absorb so you'd come back and get another back of the win field alright does a big argument made that the cannabis nowadays is much more potent than it was when the hippies were around and that's why we're getting psychosis and things again that's not true because if you're worried about the danger of smoking it's much better to have two puffs of a 15-percent weed than 30 pups of a four-percent way to get the same effect so high quality pot smoking through a reasonable device or smoke and even through a cigarette in small quantities is not dangerous it's certainly associated a bit of redness of your mocosa but it certainly doesn't have any long-term effects either on cancer itself lung cancer or on emphysema right there's no clear association of cannabis smoking and emphysema ok now the different methods of suppositories are now sorry vaping we're up to vaping so smoking may have a place its advantages are the rapid type the rapid onset and the ability to titrate so say you're dealing with a spasm situation or a pain situation you can sit there and draw on your cigarette until that goes away and you can titrate your dose and that's a very useful strategy vaporizing there has been an explosion of vaporizing technology over the last couple of years and there's some really when we when we started experimenting with vaporizing about 15 years ago I mean looking back at the things we did they look sort of comical now we used to get soldiering ions and stick them into glass jars and things like that they worked but compared to volcanoes and vape pens and things like that now we're really looking at the horse and horse and buggy day is in our vaporizing there's a lot to be said for vaporization right both in the vaporizing of the herb and the vaporizing of the concentrates like bubble law or oil or anything like that there's a lot to be said for it it's um it's a convenient method with some of the small portable vape pens you can actually use it in public even in buildings and sitting at restaurant tables without being too obvious and without there being any smell so for people that lie or need frequent administration having a little poppet vape pen and some high quality oil is a very viable way to go it's also very much more bio available now each of these methods is associated with a different amount of bioavailability by that I mean of the ingested does how much of that ends up in your bloodstream now with eating it can be as low as 10 percent so ninety percent of the herb that you e doesn't actually get into your bloodstream with vaporizing it can be three times that so if you're dealing with a problem with finances and things like that there can be an efficiency associated with vaporizing but having said that some people may prefer the oral effect and it really does come down to people finding out what suits their particular condition you can mix and match them it doesn't mean you can do one or the other you might have a biscuit in the morning and vape at night these things can be worked out by the patient the thing that I find most offensive about the way the health system and the political system treat human beings is they treat them like a nanny state these people are incapable of regulating their own pharmacological intake that's not true all the patients that I've interacted with and there's hundreds now can very rapidly learn what suits them best our role is merely to present them with options from which they can then by experience decide on what suits them the best okay suppositories there's a place for suppositories and the theory was based basically on the fact that the first few inches of the rectum aren't drained through the portal circulation so the theory goes you can give relatively large doses without there being a disabling psychotropic effect that's what the literature says in practice that's not quite true and I've had a few patients Green out quite significantly even with suppository administration part of the explanation for that is there's only a narrow part of the rectum that doesn't drain via the liver and if you go a little bit beyond that area it goes through the liver and it's exactly the same eating it but again it's horses the courses there's a whole range of preparing either just using the oil in a syringe or using coconut oil and solidifying the suppositories for conditions say for instance ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease with anal fissures that's the way to go we combine topical application as well as systemic treatment topical topical is a undeveloped resource it's very obvious now that the cannabinoids can be absorbed through the skin especially when they're complexed with medium chain triglycerides and possibly with other oils I've certainly experimented with olive oil but I just find it a little heavier than the mct and I don't think it's absorbed quite as well so we're going to the mct at the moment now in my practice I've used topicals as an emergency intervention in a seizing child where an oral administration is impossible and we've only been in that situation where we were actually hands on while it was having a couple of times but it did seem to be like a worthwhile endeavor the next situation that I found myself in is treating very young children with very very advanced cancers and it's been a real problem with any of these methods in actually getting enough cannabis into the child to make a difference and at the sort of doses that we feel may be necessary for a cancer responds the amount of gastric intolerance and just difficulty of actually eating that much is quite high and it has been a problem with the last few especially the little children that a bit fussy and well I suppose as just a big ask if anyone's tried to eat a raw bud or a piece of cannabis it's not a particularly flavoursome thing in its oral form the next pediatric cancer patient that comes my way will probably be treated by an intensive topical regime will produce the cannabis in equal blends of THC and CBD and give them daily or by daily whole body massages I'll be very interested to see how that works because I do feel we can get fairly large in a relatively innocuous way and at the same time having the physical contact with the patient which i think is an important part of their overall hearing oh okay all right"
vbZZ9QScAeE,INTERVIEW: Is medical marijuana effective?,2015-06-24T21:19:08Z,thousand eight michigan voters approved to measure that legalized the use of medical marijuana supporters of this have been outspoken for years saying the drug is safe it's an alternative way to treat diseases such as ms glaucoma and HIV but a comprehensive study just released is now kind of questioning the drug is a really an effective method of treatment according to a review rather published in the Journal of the American Medical Association there is little reliable evidence to support the drugs use researchers said there was quote moderate evidence that it helps with chronic pain and muscle spasticity related to multiple sclerosis but there was little evidence that it can relieve nausea and vomiting related to chemotherapy or that it even helps people with sleep disorders get more rest there was no reliable evidence it was useful for treating depression anxiety or pressure related to glaucoma joining us now to discuss this chief health editor Dr Pawson Andy so first of all a little surprising that after all these years suddenly we start realizing maybe it's not as effective as voters thought in 2008 well you know here's the thing though I think that they're looking at a this study looks at a bunch of other studies put together so it's kind of the first of its kind to look at it so comprehensively I like it I like the way it's going because it's finally objective evidence it's not like you know I talked to Bill he said it worked I talked to Sally and said didn't look at objective and says docks and health care providers we can look at I like it 23 states washington d.c allow for medical marijuana do you think it was rushed maybe before we had all the evidence about this he was a problem you know as a physician and as a scientist I would say yes but here's the thing as a patient advocate there's some stuff that we can't treat you have patients that are desperate so I don't think first line but there's some there's an opportunity for second and third line to get some benefit you know when you're really suffering and nothing's working what do you do so that's why I guess exactly now to know the FDA does not oversee medical marijuana because of the way it's structured under the laws so it's up to the state's decide whether it's effective whether it can be used are not used this is a problem with the fact that it's not going through the normal drug testing yeah it is you know I think that because we it is a drug so we don't approve it the product the way we drew other drugs it takes years to approve other drugs and so marijuana is not is not privy to that remember you have to prove that a drug is safe in the normal FDA process then you have to try it on people like you and I and healthy volunteers and also on people with these to make sure it works it can take up to 12 years so clearly we're not following the process that we normally do but I think that because of the fact that people were so desperate that's part of the reason why some of this went through would it meet the test do you think if it went through that whole process I don't think so because the trials were just the way this evidence comes out I think it would not let me ask you one more thing about I I know that we found in here that sixty percent of product said they contain more THC than they actually did could that account do you think for the fact that it didn't work in some cases it absolutely could the problem we don't know is that we don't know if the trials use the products that they're talking about here so you know you got me that 12 trials let's say we don't know what the content of THC is but remember also twenty-three percent of people had more THC than 8th promised your having you eating the stuff and so you can get lots of side effects that people don't think about got about 15 seconds what do you got coming up for five o'clock you know the FDA is putting a big announcement & E Shore you got to listen and watch and and see what they're talking about really important option for for women exactly okay we'll be watching today dr. Nandi thank you very much
ISh5PLRJPGE,The Pot Doctor,2015-09-23T21:57:11Z,I haven't sought to avoid legal troubles I mean our primary motivation is to actually advance the cause of medical cannabis over the last few years even though I've operated quite openly I haven't contracted any negative legal intervention which is appreciated but we're prepared to fight on any front that's presented and if it's necessary that we go to court and dispute the prohibition against medical cannabis and that's exactly what we'll do my name's Andrew cattle heiress I graduated from Sydney University Medical School in 1982 and obtained experience in hospitals in pathology and clinical based medicine I was D registered in 2005 for my continuing involvement in medical cannabis but continued both to see patients clinically and to advise them where where clinical applications not appropriate advise them on the rationale and beneficial uses of cannabis these are essential to our to our agriculture there's an ecological aspect of these bees are also a good company I mean people keep cooks I kept chops and bees that that I mean we can learn a lot from these right they're much more organized and socially coordinated than we are as a species don't forget that [Laughter] hey why is that they can live in relative peace and harmony without any formal law system we don't live in a society we live in a competing war zone out there we're greedy and self-interested people exercise their power for their own ease and not for sociability [Music] marijuana's the dried leaves and flowers of the Indian hemp weed is used in the form of a cigarette marijuana smoking experts point out can make a helpless addict of its victim within weeks causing physical and moral ruin and death what did they call it they called it the heathen devil weed with its roots in hell that's what cannabis was referred to and that's what's formed our policy in the 30s they ran with the reefer madness campaign and ran a ten year hysterical propaganda which culminated in the prohibition and we're still being saddled with the false assertions we'll put out then okay we're off to see the production facility now it's bizarre that in the 21st century we have to actually hide the production of life-saving medicine but that's what we have to do welcome to the lab since we have discovered the amazing therapeutic effects of CBD in childhood epilepsy it's become imperative that our work be not disturbed because there's nothing worse than actually helping a child to achieve wellness and then by lack of product and not being able to continue with that wellness so therefore we're forced into hidden places to avoid the ignorant and draconian policies that are currently limiting access to medical cannabis for sick and dying children THC is certainly the most well known of the cannabinoids but CBD has a huge range of therapeutic application and as an on psychotropic cannabinoid that not only has its own therapeutic value but it tends to moderate ameliorate the some of the psychotropic effects of the THC we put a hundred grams of trimmed bud into the sonicator I'm currently using medium chain triglyceride oil as the carrier and we can generally produce a finished product which has approximate four milligrams of mil making it rather easy to titrate the dose for even young children you can't do it without the sonication I mean really this is just an infusion of the cannabinoids into the oil and it can be achieved simply by soaking and agitation although the sonication makes it far more efficient so when the sonication is finished we strain and bottle the product and it's then packaged and dispensed to the people who need it there's different ways of approaching the profession if you call it that of Medicine the wise people have an awareness of what their limitations are and they seek this they seek to cure occasionally seek to relieve often but to comfort always so even if the therapeutic event ends in totality it doesn't mean it's without value this journey has taken me and introduced me to a range of parents laboring under the most the most difficult and thought circumstances having a child not only with a life-threatening illness and having their whole family consumed by the process of seeking urgent medical attention and things like that but then having to cross a societal ban of illegal drugs to in the hope of finding finding relief it's not an easy journey for them but on the whole I've been quite impressed by the dedication that these parents managed to focus on their afflicted children it I've seen a lot of real love in this last 12 months I have to say real love in action and it's been quite inspiring hey you're very big man are you ready [Music] [Music] Cooper got meningitis when he was only four weeks old he was too young to be vaccinated against it then that paused to be a brand image he had his first seizure at five weeks old and then he developed hydrocephalus and cerebral palsy he would have seizures constantly every day despite medications like a lot of families were probably fearful of using what was what was basically described as an illegal substance to try their son and in the end in the end he was coming to the end of his life and we sort of said well like the cancer patients was just keeping comfortable and it did a bit more than keep him comfortable it's given him a quality of life for the otherwise would have never had and yeah then after the cannabis he sort of started pulling himself up on his knees he got a better and yeah he started started crawling now he's a bee pulls himself up on furniture to stand there walking doesn't seem out of the question now [Music] they all climb overing he sleeps on the couch and wakes up in the morning two kids climbing bonding you can't really put into words what he's done for us and thousands of others it's just it's just just an incredible life to have compared to what we did have and it's all thanks to Andrew [Music] Cannabis drops can be given safely to children with aches and pains and fevers and things like that right especially CBD cannabis is entirely safe you have to think about the question you've just asked you're asking me why do I provide life-saving medicine to kids with intractable to serious diseases I have to be mad not to is the answer right I mean it's a sad reflection in our society that that question gets out right I do it because I've luckily been given the indications and the intelligence to be able to do it all right but that's the reason why you do it that should be self-evident to everyone I've been mightily disappointed when cops say steal your plants or burn your farm and destroy valuable seed genetics that have been built up over years yeah you're furious but I mean you have to manage it I mean we're dealing with a seriously hypocritical group of people what it's taking is what we're doing we're actually just going to create our own reality independent of the political process we're not waiting for law reform right we're establishing increasing numbers of grows with treating increasing numbers of patients and encouraging them on the road to health independence so yeah we're not really waiting it would go faster forward or forward a lot faster if we could actually have the cooperation of an intelligent and compassionate government but absent that we have to do what we can do the human condition is this we have a mind big enough to ask the big questions but a mind too small to receive the big answers so we're stuck in that gap of almost scene right and that's the human condition so you have to take some of it on trust that's the way it works right I mean I affirm in my own mind that good kind and loving is better than mean nasty and cruel that should be self-evident to some people it's not right I question their humanity yeah we just like to say oh of course I'm massive thank you to Andrew for providing this medicine to our kids words can't really see as grateful we are and for him being able to do this locate quality of life are hugely improved by what he does and we really love it because of it Andrew we just thank you from the bottom of our hearts like it's just amazing what you do for our family and for all these other little kids out there we just love you so much you're amazing I advise it like I would like very much to thank you for always keeping us in supply even when the video was lo hee hee facial we kept his supply for always picking that hunter's okay and Quentin hunters venules he's you know he do make sure he's okay um basically just thanking you for keeping hunter alive I mean that's the thing what he's doing without it I don't think how to still be here so he's keeping him alive I was basically given a choice give up medical cannabis research and stay registered or leave the profession if I wish to continue my research it wasn't a very hard decision seeing the therapeutic effects of what we were doing and the clear superiority of cannabis therapeutics whether they used as a solar agent or as a con you can't watch it saying that you can't turn your back on people so yeah there's something that will help you a great deal but you can't have it that's simply not acceptable for me leaving a nest of liars and crooks is not a sacrifice people say all you've sacrificed you know this is an important point therefore you've sacrificed your career this is my career right if I was one of the yes men in a white coat that's not a career that's a role of a yes man in the white coat right it simply didn't suit my personality but I've not sacrifice my career this is my career [Music] you
VxYjOVFw9tc,Dr David Caldicott - Return to Terra Nullius Redux,2015-08-24T00:22:21Z,"this is one of the favorite crowds in the world to talk to and i think you know i love in australia how people acknowledge the traditional owners of the land and i would like to reiterate that i would like to add my acknowledgement to the traditional custodians of plants in australia which i think is you lot and i come here because i love you and because I learned so much from you every time I come here so kudos to you for keeping this government for 10 years and happy birthday I'm here to help you celebrate so obviously I I got a couple of ideas of what you've been up to I can't speak to y'all but this is this is what I've been up to does the cold-cut breeding program was started I don't know what sort of ethnobotanical God has taken egg three girls on me but yeah karma has come to crap in my ass so that's what I've been doing and I have to sort of credit the title of this talk to the little Jedi in the front there Yoda the whoa dak you can you can hang out with Rodak and he comes out with these things and it just makes you think he's like some sort of zoo atrophic agent himself and we were at a conference in Canberra honey was referring I don't even know where why he was using the term terra nullius but it occurred to me oh my god that's something that we can talk about as far as drugs policies is concerned and so that's kind of where I'm going to go I you know me the last time we sat down and chatted together it might have been in the strathbogie ranges and I think it's the longest ever talk that's been given by anyone ever which is probably why I've been put last here so so this could go on a bit but we'll try to keep the time so for those of you who aren't familiar with this term terra nullius it's his obnoxious legal term which kind of alludes to the fact that your glorious leader has spoken to on a number of occasions which there wasn't much here before the brits arrived lo de Kock and you and I both know that but it got me thinking that in fact as far as the the drugs psycho sphere is concerned really that the international drug conventions are kind of the equivalent of the arrival of the British because before the arrival of the international conventions though there wasn't anything much telling people what to do now prohibitionists would say that there was a terra nullius but in fact there was lots going on we actually were handling ourselves quite well thank you very much and this is essentially an occupation if you like of the environment in which people consume drugs it's been occupied nearly for a hundred years formerly since the 1960s it's the three drugs treaties and that hasn't done much for us really it's successfully banned a wide variety of substances in your case many plants and of course even more synthetics there i would love to update this this slide in terms of what's been banned i would imagine that it probably ranges closer 2000s than hundreds now and trillions of dollars have been wasted in this endeavor I just invite you to think a little bit about what a trillion means I'm a simple man and I need these sort of these pictures to remind me um this man here is stunned at his good luck on stumbling upon a million dollars in his path here that's uh these are bundled $100 notes and that's what a million dollars would look like in terms of bundled notes so what's a trillion you would say that it would be a little bit more maybe something like the size of the man but it's not that no it's it's a million million it's a thousand billion it's got 12 zeros after it and that's what it would look like those are double pallets double stacked of dollars and that's what 1 trillion dollars looks like I can't begin to tell you what health innovations I could do with just one of that set of trillion dollars but we're talking about trillions and trillions of dollars being fought for a drug war that essentially has no end and probably has done for me harm than good so this is a terrible scenario and the problem is is that the people who are waging this war are largely addicted to the products so we're seeing increasing militarization of law enforcement white collar industry loves this because it generates a sort of a circle of income and of course profiteers from the producing criminal side of things enjoy it as well so the people who really don't want to end the war on drugs are not very nice people at all and us in Australia you know this is a kind of how we're spending money it's a little bit dumb that the vast majority of this is being spent on law enforcement these are the most recent figures that I can accurately rely upon but of course that doesn't account for the total expenditure because what we really need to do is consider what we have to spend to mop up the nonsense afterwards as well so to add another one point nine billion onto this mess afterwards where is this all leading will the Apes take control of everything eventually are we looking at an apocalyptic demise of our species um I don't think so i think i am more optimistic than this i actually think that the drug conventions are under pressures that they can almost no longer bear and i think those of us who are interested in a more generous time need to start thinking about what we're going to do after all of this has fallen down should we be thinking about revisiting a land before the conventions you know me I like telling story so I'm going to tell a story about well what I've been doing over the last 10 years so my story in The Australian drug scene probably starts with pill testing at raves in South Australia so that was it's about 10 years ago and this is from the enchanted series and that there were innocent days you know if you had a positive tests and a color metric spot test you knew what you were dealing with Eden you know there was only about four things that were around anyway so it's actually these lovely times in witted only times would be a doctor because you know most of the time you just had to treat people with narcan or some benzos and that was about it the world has changed a lot hasn't it we published some of this data and I guess that was the first inkling that we had that there were other things out there they're interlopers and we'd identified products that just weren't being turned up by law enforcement and that weren't being turned up by customs the alpha methyl tryptamines the DM mas the sort of phenomenon of our dance party colleagues using the rave is it like a youth fest to show off their latest where's and this was obviously a place where we had to be if we wanted to find out what was new and coming onto the market you had to occupy that space I don't know if any of you were went to club health in Sydney in 2005 where the good folk from New Zealand we're handing these fine things at all and sundry made for a very interesting after party i can tell you i actually think this is the first legal high that was ever described in australia certainly the first i can come across i would once again with the width that I associate with your community they were described as ease you know like a play on ecstasy very smartly package black and white goes with everything and containing four pills each of which contained greater than ninety-nine percent pure meth alone and no none of us had a bloody clue what that was we didn't they it took us ages to find a standard against which we could bear it um and this is back in 2005 it's like oh hello that's very interesting in 2007 a couple of us did an analysis with a certain amount of criticism I must add from the blue light website of these neo doves and I actually think this is probably one of the first characterizations of mephedrone in Australia and you know the mephedrone is this fascinating progenitor of everything knows that what i call the queen of the new stoned age and if it's it's that the model in which mephedrone was marketed has now taken off i bought this just out of interest when I was back in the UK see how it would work I was a little scared to take it but I just wanted to see how quick it would come so I i went online and i gave them my credit card details and i was living in like the original wales not the new south wales but the original south wales at the time and it was shipped to me from London and I got it in rural Wales within six hours of ordering it online yeah that's delivery and this clearly became a brand new paradigm for the sort of drugs but you know you and I grew up with this is something very new very unusual if you're interested in this story I have no vested interest in this at all Mike power has written this extraordinary journalistic book called drugs 2.0 he's turned into a very good friend of mine and we chat a lot he's a very interesting man he's done a lot of research I commend to you this book it reads beautifully well he's interviewed everyone he's lambasted the people who need lambaste it's a great read so I guess in retrospect we could hardly be surprised about this you know hundred years of a very cumbersome way of prohibition and the prohibition of these drugs is I guess similar to the idea of treating the same infection on your foot with the same antibiotic and it was done we should have expected that a new market would evolve so it's not just the drugs that we're talking about here we're talking about an entire new market so if you use the analogy say of influenza now I get sort of exposed to flu every year and I'm sorry if there's a bit of a medical theme going through this but I'm kind of a doctor so it's all I really know but flu flu changes suddenly every year and I get a flu jab and try very hard not to poison my children when I take flew home and then every now and again some weird ass zombie pig licking avian flu thing comes along and kills off a whole bunch of people and we call the first thing a sort of an antigenic drift you know flu is making its way to the population changing enough to survive for the next generation and then there's this massive change like the emergence of meth like the emergence of MDMA they're not always dangerous they're not always bad but there's the sort of tectonic movement in the market and we've just had another one so what are the effects of this we've got brand new products which we've never seen before they're manufactured clearly to pharmaceutical purity there are far more variety than law enforcement can ever hope to ban they're identified and sourced online by consumers they're paid for using cryptocurrencies untraceable payment the delivered by your post Eon is honda c100 they're unrecognizable by sniffer dogs they are very difficult for us to identify and treat in the context of overdose because not all of them cause overdosed by any means and you can't find them in people's wee-wee so be none of these things are in fact a move forward for drugs policy I reckon they they make the dealing with these products both as a consumer and somebody who needs to deal with the harm associated with them a much more difficult proposition here's another example of what's going on and other good pieces is online you can access it the drug of revolution that no one can stump we're writing this up at the moment so Mike was fascinated by this idea of these novel drugs and so he said screw it let's invent something let's Commission something new and I thought well shits and giggles let's do that so he identified a drug which is an old rogue it's really responsible for the productivity of the Beatles in their Hamburg years he methylated fen metra zine and he rang around spend a bit of money I suppose on long-distance phone calls and came up with a sort of a cover store he was trying to develop a drug for I think was a cough mixture for dogs or something along that line and so for for only 600 pounds he managed to get himself a gram of pharmacologically pure absolutely pure we tested it of six methyl fan Metro scene and that's how long it took so we now have an era of concierge drug design where you can ring up if you have the chemical knowledge and you know what you want you can Commission the creation of new drugs and I'm not one for exaggeration but i like to call this phenomenon the vortex of doom I spend a lot of my time fighting with the tabloids so I thought I'd get my own back and i'll tell you how the vortex of doom works so what you have is you've got new compounds developed that fall outside current legislation the law catches up and the process repeats and it's very simple really but the problem is is that it sucks a lot of people into it now I have a lot of confidence in the way that you folk use drugs every time I talk to any of you it's pretty sensible many of you are functional consumers and I don't imagine that I have to treat many of you other day in the emergency department you stay safe that is not the case for young people who are getting you into this scene and so a lot of people are getting sucked into this sort of vortex potentially at a time when something new nasty and dangerous is becoming available we've seen some tragic consequences potentially of that this summer in Australia already if you don't believe me at the rate of evolution of these products I think you might have seen this already today but this is from the emc DDA there this is the rate of evolution of these novel products and I think the thing that interests me is that while you've got all the tryptamines in the fennel FLA means it's the other products it's those things that actually don't belong to a big class themselves it's all very well if groups of products are evolving like herds on the savanna but it's the rogue ones that scare the [ __ ] out of me and this is a dangerous place to be you all will have heard of mptp or my own personal favorite PMA god bless his soul he passed away this year but alexander shulgin and i had a discussion about PMA and he really wanted to know why Australians were so keen on it and this was some time ago when people were pursuing this environment I'm actually concerned about the spontaneous evolution of something that is as dangerous as PMA and something we should be concerned as and perhaps your community could should be concerned as as elders within the consuming knowledge base I'm going to say something controversial because I can this is not a problem of the drugs themselves this is a problem of how we've dealt with them so what should we do well look I think there are two approaches and they're complementary one of them we should have in the background we should sort of almost embrace it as a philosophy and the other we should just get on if I can do it so I've divided them into fluffy and pointy approaches to the problem fluffy pointing fluffy so this is something this is an approach that I'm taking at the moment with our friends in in spheres of political influence and it involves say a sea change in the way that we think about these things I think approaches to drugs have to be based on science and harm and not morality now there would be those of you who would say well that's bollocks that's all medical but this is the dialogue that is understandable within a community looking for change we're going to talk a little bit about the discourse of pleasure but i think the science has to take front and foremost precedents in this rather than any sort of vague philosophical morality based discussion i think the emphasis has to be on public health criminality and every decision that we make regarding products novel product sold products how we deal with them has to consider the downstream implications of implementation what do I mean by that okay but this is a political way of speaking this this looks really popular let's do that now that's I would describe as policy based evidence okay you are finding evidence to suit your policy agenda but that's not public health that's not science that's not even really good policy in the theory of policy the real approach that we should be looking at is ok we have an alternative that will probably lead to an outcome that we desire and it's actually not important what the alternative looks like it's the outcome that we desire which is important and therefore we should it be embracing alternative a now that involves legislating for individual products that are currently banned or illegal if that involves changing the law so that fewer people get harmed by a given product that's the right policy so what we need to do I suppose is to create and state what our aims are and that's I think half the problem in Australia is that we have a very nebulous argument against drugs and my argument to people who put out this sort of non argument norm debate about drug something that can't be put down the classic is this sends the wrong message what I want them to do is to nail something down make something concrete for me do you want people to use drugs less or do you want fewer people hurt for example because probably you can't have both so make up your mind if it's acceptable to you for young people to die because you want to send a message to others just be explicit about that it's kind of like the refugee situation you know just put out a statement and say gee no wash we're kind of stopping the whole treaties that we signed up for as far as refugees so just be honest about it and everybody will trust you what about spiky and pointy things my backgrounds kind of testing so I'm sorry if this is dull but I think we really need to nail down analytical research especially with the novel psychotropics but I think there is going to be a lot of interest in the analytical side of cannabis soon I'm very hopeful about medical medicinal cannabis and I'll talk to about this a bit a little bit later one of the interesting developments that we're looking at out of our research group in the UK is the idea of using a product as its own reference the products which are being delivered to Australia of such a purity that there's not a lot else in them except the product that's being ordered now if you could characterize that then you can use it as a zone reference one of the things that delays the analysis of these products internationally is the fact that shipping these things around the place is fraught with legal danger why not just use the product itself there's plenty of stuff that we need to look at as far as looking at the stability of products on analysis so some of these are really quite fragile and actually doing the analysis itself breaks them up in such a way that we're not really sure what we are analyzing in the first place and also why not anticipate what's coming next and start making it and see if it hurts animals to start with I don't have a problem hurting animals if it's stopping my kids getting hurt we have very little information about the toxicological data associated with these novel products and I think one of the key things that we could be doing here is setting up a spectrum of risk it'll Alex alluded to this earlier on the hilarity that cocaine and cannabis occupy the same cross on the line of Spector on the line of risk what a load of crap we need to look at all of our products and ensure that we are talking about the same risk for the same sort of product and on that line alcohol should be there as well all of these products should be considered together and we should anything we consume for the purposes of entertainment should be rationally assigned a risk and therefore legislated against as far as a risk is concerned for a product that contains no risk hey go hard I don't care there's a lot of work to be done on receptor analyses and and I think that there are a lot of products that are emerging on the market that we really should be looking at for therapeutic purposes we have a problem with cannabis God knows how we get on with a the novel psychotropic problems this is another thing that I think we're terrible at in Australia I don't know it hands up anyone here who's a sort of a mainstream drug researcher where are you that's it what three good on you three people the largest gathering of wisdom in this thing in this world in which we have inhabit in Australia and you got three researchers kudos to you brilliant for turning up but you know there is disengagement between the consumer and the people trying to keep them safe and I think that gap needs to be crossed to really do having said that I think that the consumer you know with great respect I think you're kind of guilty of over stretching the safety of many of these products you know I know I treat them come and walk a mile in my shoes and see what I've seen and I think you probably wouldn't be as reassured about how safe many of them are some of them do nothing and your problem is is the ones which are most active for the ones which are most fun are probably the most dangerous as well I think we need to find common ground between researchers between law enforcement between legislators and between consumers and decide where can we work from because at the moment it's us in them it's you know you are having things legislated for you and correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think many of you are involved in the legislative process last time I looked I think one of the things that we have to do from my side of the defenses we kind of have to get into this discourse of pleasure which is it's a dog for us we got to admit that you know this is fun and it is I know but it's something that has to be accepted even at a legal level because you cannot have this discourse with consumers unless you start I do lectures with secondary school kids and I give a very different message to them than I would to you if I was the lecture to sort of primary Catholic schoolgirls I say you're going to hell if you use drugs and because that's probably what they should know about to you i'm going to say look lads be safe okay yeah you know I prefer a quiet night in the emergency department and and to people who are using intravenous drugs I will go the further yard and provide them with needles and syringes to keep them safe so we need to tailor our messages to the audience of consumers that we're dealing with I think in 2015 we should be really thinking about tapping the knowledge that you folk have with great respect my scientific colleagues and my medical colleagues I don't think anybody knows more about drugs than you do I think that's particularly pertinent say for example in the case of medicinal cannabis I think it's really important that we return there's this sort of debate that there's not a lot of research oh that's crap to start with but in fact there's ongoing ad hoc research in cannabis everywhere always and that may not be written down in the journals but there's a verbal knowledge out there that needs to be tapped and we need to accept that the quality of research may start with a verbal history to start with I'm very interested in not merely asking people what they're taking but in fact give me that you little bastard I'll test it I and i'm not i'm not that I don't trust you when you tell me this is what you're taking I honestly don't think you know well you know with great respect us a powder I'll have some of that lovely I don't know what it is but i'll have some it made me feel wonderful last time it was white and it was powdery yeah so i don't think that's a good approach from your perspective i think that could end up in trouble and arsenic is white and powdery as well when it's ground off so we need to sort of come to a way of working out what you're taking and maybe you know influencing your decision whether or not you want to take it or not and this is one of the things I do so that's a lot of what I've been up to in the last sort of five or so years is trying to work out systems whereby we can find out what you folks are trying to alter your reality with we have no real handle on things like social harms on injuries or deaths you might think oh yes they've bought a computer and it tells me exactly how many people are hurt or killed by methoxy to mean no now we've got a computer that tells us if you sprained your ankle or we had palpitations or any of the many things that could have happened while you were using me Fox that I mean and I think we should be far more explicit than that it's not that I want to prove that any of these products are more dangerous in fact I'm far more eager and proving how much more dangerous alcohol is in comparison to these products I don't think any of these products in the grand scheme of things is going to even flick on my radar in comparison to the prescribed opiates the prescribed benzos or alcohol but I can't prove that to anyone unless I'm collating that data so we triangulate data so lot of time from the stories that you tell us from surveys that we take from poisons informations data published some case reports and usually they are only the most dramatic things and we bring the emergency department data to this equation and so a while back we we had a go at emergency department amnesty bins this is my favorite picture ever because it gives me the opportunity to show PMA on Royal Adelaide Hospital headed paper so but hey we I think where was it the red Mitsubishi's or something long time ago and and we we were able to identify these things well before my good friends in law enforcement were able to be as we went looking for them d MMA and alpha methyl tryptamine so we tried to set up a drug testing system in in South Australian to say that it was politically not the right time was probably an understatement but i arrived in Wales that's the original Wales not the sort of newfangled New South Wales back in 2010 right at the same time as the emergence of these novel psychotropic substances and there was a lot going on and we discovered that the welsh assembly government public health bunch said yeah yeah we want to know too off you go and so we immediately transplanted the methodology that we had developed for South Australian were banned from using to Wales and and no one behold we had proof of concept so we were able to identify products associated with harm identify patterns of harmful use and indeed develop brief interventions for consumers about how they might want to change how they're consuming drugs and this is a group of people who are using drugs anyway so we're not telling them not to use drugs we're just telling them not to sort of roll five pills at the same time and that's this is our our little group go and google it it's changed a little bit so it's it's come in for a bit of flack it's become a system it initially started as a system for monitoring presentations to hospitals associated with harm and it's just taken off it's worth 700 million pounds at the moment and it's now become a postal service so if you've got a product that you want to find out what's in you can post it in we'll put it online and the results will be up probably fortnight maybe a week if you're lucky and we'll analyze anything so it's a long way to send stuff so what I thought what we ought to do is maybe replicated in Australia so this is the sort of thing that we do some jolly green granules that's not particularly useful to me that sounds like some sort of frozen pea and so the first phase of it is what we couple the patient's clinical detail so what they're presenting with you know did their head fall off did they have palpitations and we couple that to a toxicological analysis so using initially in the first phase of GC ms analysis and then if we couldn't find out what a profile from the current GCMs catalogs we used NMR and that's those and that would nothing has actually defeated us today so we were one of the first people to identify me thought settlement in the UK using this tool and unable to map where people consume them now there is no question that patients individual identity would ever be revealed here but we are able to give community workers ideas where large rates of consumption are occurring which rates a consumption that result in harm and that will allows the more rational deployment of community workers to say well hang on a second why are more people getting hurt in this postcode than elsewhere and and that we basically got a carte blanche from law enforcement to do this from a public health perspective and so that's what the wedding our website looks like you're given a unique identifier number with the form that you download to put the details on and then you plug in your number and you get the result of what your analysis is and we've had quite good success so between October 2013 and jun 2014 we had just over 1300 samples sent to us with 213 new products identified and including some products that hadn't been described before at least in the UK so this is this is useful it's providing us information that is coupled to clinical information which then we can feed back to the consumer groups and say well actually do you know what that's that's potentially harmful and if we see a lot of what it is then we can say do you know what that's really harmful so and we can also identify patterns in the way people are consuming and what they want to consume I give this to some clever person that the presentation so you can use it yourselves at some stage this is my favorite today's best bang for buck contains just about every licit it plus a couple of pharmaceuticals that I've ever heard of so that was clearly put together by somebody under the influence of cocaine is my deduction and this is my little group now and I'm gleefully wandering around analyzing anything you're prepared to send to me this is our latest most interesting pill you'll know how what a [ __ ] idiot I am you know from I actually describe this when I submitted it as a hula hula dancer like a man going like this that's what I thought it was but of course you know it's not spokes bunny so didn't I feel an idiot yeah yeah so I'm still a [ __ ] um but our analysis revealed it to be a pill a pill mind you sold as MDMA but containing both 25 I and 25 c nbome that's an unexpected finding for me and I think the community deserves to know about that and so when we get something like this the first place we put the results in some places like blue light because that's who we work for we will then tell the poisons units and the various people other people officials that need to know we let them know as well but it's the consumer community is where my mandate is to and we found some other interesting stuff I emphasize that none of these have any attractive hologram logos on so these are not endorsed by the people that matter in this room but we've acquired these and this is quite a sort of a typical scenario don't let kids use them i think that's a good idea and also the idea that this is to be used for something else you know they don't dream of consuming this yourself it's for fabric fragrance something or other and this contains both PB 22 and the fluorinated version of it which is a little bit more alarming I think all of these we had a little look at once again all of them containing PB 22 and the fluorinated version of them look I don't have a problem necessarily with people using unusual products but I do I do genuinely think people should know what they're using and we see interestingly here a commercial tension between the producers of these products Who are very keen not to be shut down not to be because unfortunately the knee-jerk response is as soon as a new product is characterized it's banned now this is part of the problem yeah you know we're not attaching these products to risk spectra we're not doing a risk analysis of these products we're just merely banning them once we know what they are and that drives this forward double your poison contains just oral serotonin the silver doves and you know i love these convoluted botanical descriptions on the ingredients list you know how very fascinating that anybody would read that and believe it it in fact contains merely caffeine an interesting pimpri which is the sort of peppery taste of black pepper some people think that it's got a psycho hallucinogenic activity but it's more anecdotal than anything anything else it's just largely caffeine now that's a that's a $35 espresso for you there's a few other people doing this sort of thing the Americans have got this toxicology investigators consortium we're rather excitingly teaming up with the folks in Stockholm Strider so we're going to be sharing data with them and our intention is to make sure that all of this if I can work out how to use the interweb then I'll be able to start posting these results on our websites but we were hacked with like a whole bunch of other people and so it automatically closed down we have to relaunch our website so please come and find us on our website and there'll be more information there for you soon I think another area which and remember I am my goal here is to try to put these novel products into context I'm not trying to demonstrate that they're killing everybody always because I don't think they are I think there are products which are terribly dangerous and I think we when those sort of products come on the market we need to be able to get on top of them in collaboration with each other to shut them down very quickly and stop them filtering out say for example at a dance party where you could be faced with 10 20 people seriously unwell and so there will be products that are dangerous there are many that are not and so we actually just set up a novel project now so you'll appreciate that they do like my acronyms dead set which is the deaths from emergencies and accidents data set and we'll be looking trolling through now that's the national coronal inquest system which is that it's typical for you Australians you set up something extraordinary and then you don't use it and what you've done is you've callate it over 300,000 Caronia reports about everything anything that had a coroner's report is recorded here and that includes all poisonings and all deaths from alcohol and I look forward to looking at deaths from alcohol as our first project these are meth tests from 2000 current and we it looks like a little bit of spider [ __ ] but if you look at the numbers on the access to your left there we're only talking maybe 10 to 20 per state per annum and then if you adjust for population the only state in which deaths from meth are actually increasing is in w wa so I think there is a large group of people consuming meth particularly in the rural environment but they're not killing everybody everywhere we've started a toxicology registry to start measuring the actual amounts of harm and I think one of the other things that we need to do and I'll say that to my or other colleagues in the room is that within our sector we need to play nice together now i know i have a very luxurious environment i actually believe it or not have a full-time job as a doctor so I have a wage I don't have to worry about grants or anything I just do this for shits and giggles largely and you know it's it's it's sad to see colleagues fighting among themselves and trying to steal a march on getting the limited grant money that's available and I think if we thought a little bit more about how to collaborate with people outside our own silos we'd find the resources were there to do everything that we wanted to do together I think coming to the end of all of this we need to think about rational legislation and that needs to be based on harm the aim needs to be based on Oh directed towards reducing the number of people that are hurt through drug use now not overdose not acutely hurt also the way people use drugs the number of people who get infected by hepatitis and blood-borne disease but it should be based on harm and that probably means moving away from all of the drug treaties so things that are dumb you know I look the only had I don't know they didn't have five hours so I limit myself to these dumb things closing all the bricks and mortar shops in ireland's that was tremendous that would great boon to the internet business in Ireland and in fact increased the number of novel psychotropics being sold in Ireland sequentially sacking all of your advisors until you find a group that agrees with you in which they did in the UK jail everybody who uses drugs which is tremendous because what happens there is that to survive in American jail these days you need to be a member of a gang and to be joined a member of a gang you probably have to Shiv somebody so you go into jail having killed somebody in jail maybe having picked up a hepatitis disease from your intravenous use while in jail for merely possession of cannabis it's a genius outcome of course Australia is not one to be left out of these things no banning all products on the basis of their packaging fabulous and how we laughed when we saw that or my favorite I have to say banning all plants that contain DMT yes that's right that's right ah I don't need to tell you that that includes your national floral emblem yeah so genius so you know Australia is currently contributing to drugs policy what it is to climate control um so yeah it's time to wrest control from the monkeys so what is rational what's useful I have to say I'm a little bit admiring of the Kiwis and their psychoactive substances act I think there are problems with it and it got put through live with hilarious to hear ya everybody voted for it cuz they had no [ __ ] clue what it was about but it's there now yeah and and I think one of the interesting I've been talking to some some pharmacy folk and one of the interesting things that may come out of this I don't know if you're aware but drug companies have these enormous back catalogues of products that they've tested for x y&z and many of them are shelved for a wide variety of reasons some of those reasons are because they were psychoactive and so many of these have already undergone phase 2 trials they've had human trials and the only reason that they were not deployed as an anti-smoking agent to as an antidepressant was because they were too psychoactive so if a drug company were to look at the Oscar the the Kiwi market and say hmm I think I can calculate how much that market is worth they're ready to go and I think that's maybe where we see the next product some big balls probably smaller drug company saying oh this this I'm proudly European sorry and I'm very in favor of the concept of risk-based rules so the idea if you if any of you find something that doesn't hurt anybody do you know what gretsch sellers if you can make a million dollars but you can have at it but it's the product that you're launching is you know creating birth defects or whatever it's going to be banned if you continue to sell it you should be thrown in jail where's the argument there I don't think there's a problem with that so this idea of risk stratifying like every single other pharmaceutical product that we is ever developed anywhere in the world creating a risk stratification as to what the harms might be the Europeans have embraced it this year I've yet to see how it's implemented but they've all signed off to it so we're left with this idea that you know you've got this unstoppable force of our drive well these days your drive to consume interesting things and the edifices that have been put up to stop you doing that how on earth can we possibly get past all of this you are as a species I would say we are in a hole in a very big hole but here's the thing about holes the first thing that you should do if you find yourself in a hole is to stop digging and I actually think that there could be light at the end of this tunnel and I think I'm sorry I know this is going to work some of you but I think it may be through the stepping stones of the medical use of illicit drugs and I know that many of you think that that's well that's not acceptable that's you know a violation of my illicit rights my conscious rights to do whatever I want to do hey that philosophically may be the case but I'm what I'm talking about as a pragmatic approach to the way this may pan so here's what I think I think very soon in Australia there will be medical cannabis and I think and that's compassionate that's the right thing and I think after a few years that of that being the case with the number of vino soldiers and navy folk that you're sending to Afghanistan and to sort of mop up the mess of tipped over refugees they're all going to have post-traumatic stress disorder eventually your entire Australian Defence Force will have post-traumatic stress disorder and you will not have an efficient armed force in this country to save your life they will demand treatment and that treatment will come in the form of an MDMA trial I think that's an inevitability I think there is a ground swell of opinion currently unspoken but fuelled also with a disillusionment in the inability of this current government to provide an adequate pay rise to the ADF people are looking for a way to flip the bird at the government and this may be the way forward why do I think this is a got anything to do with recreational drug use and I would emphasize and argue that i do not see the two issues as in any way connected from a legislative purpose from the direct purposes of creating a way in which people can access additional products for medical reasons I see this being a natural progression because what will happen is that there will be an increasing number of people because we're an aging population using cannabis perhaps just for pain relief and lo and behold they're not all dying they're not allow granny hasn't actually switched to meth this week and so this will now become a topic of conversation around the dinner table we're already seeing this talkback radio some reprehensible people are advocating for medical use of drugs that are now currently illegal and it is this popular movement that will actually drive legislative change I think what will happen is you will see people choosing not to prosecute the law in the way that it's written for maybe even a decade and then in the end people st. you know what it'd be like laws about sodomy people say Jesus why is that still on the books and people will say to themselves let's just change the law I said this morning and I'll say it again the entire our species has been brainwashed about the evils of certain drugs and no doubt they have caused harm but it's been going on for a hundred years and it's going to take hopefully a fraction of that to reverse what essentially has been untruths but it'll take a long time to reverse that and it'll take a concerted effort it'll take people being reasonable about it and like a Yoda has said earlier probably a softly-softly approach will gain you more traction than Manning the barricades and carrying the banner so where are we heading so this is a lovely diagram it's not mine i wish it was looking at the sort of spectrum of approaches to drugs and and looking at the social and health harms and the harms of drugs often come where you have an unregulated criminal market or an unregulated legal market so if you think of say like alcohol and tobacco this is the last frontier for the Cowboys in the lobby industry in the world they are call industry can do what of the hella likes in this country but I think that's going to get shut down soon I hope and by the same token I think we're going to see increasing leniency in the illicit markets and what I suspect will happen maybe a decade Alex would argue more but somewhere in the middle we'll have a tightly regulated market for both which is probably where we should be so in summary the drug treatises are just groaning under the pressure of dealing with the market that they were never designed for you know this this is overtaken the treaties in a way that could never have been anticipated and that a nimble viral market like the novel psychotropics deserves an equally nimble clever response to ensure that people don't get hurt there's a ton of research to be done here and that's exciting for me and there are plenty of lessons that we can learn from overseas we do not have to reinvent the wheel here we just have to be plagiarists and pick and choose the best of what the rest of the world has to offer because at the moment it's not from Australia there are those who are going to say this is the end of the world as we know it and you know what I applaud that I'm delighted it's about time that the end of the world as we knew it ended thanks very much for your time now when I said I loved you I meant it so please get in touch I think you guys are wise and I think you have a lot to offer and if you want an outlet in a more formal environment and I think many of you deserve it come and find us and we can chat and if you I think the solution to a lot of the problems of harm in Australia will come from you guys it's certainly a common from the Polly's nor the slightly nerdy folk that I mingle with including myself it'll be you guys who save yourselves so get in touch with me and we'll chat hello David thank you very much for the talk always awesome um I've got a question when you say that some of these new drugs are quite dangerous I wondering what is your opinion of the N Boehm Thai police legends that I know you claim has been largely negative for my experience so I'm sure that within this room there are people who've worked at how to use them safely so I know that what's his name your man from the drug survey global drug survey I don't mean stop yeah dr. Wyn stock has come up with a sort of a new approach and that's largely go low and go slow and I suspect you know if we were clever we could come up with a very good way of minimizing the potential harm from the end of the problem with the end bones and young Stephen probably knows as much if not more about these than I do is that they're very long acting they're very intense and people generally you know if you take a lot of LSD you're probably going to get into trouble because you're evading the giant bat attached to your head or something along these lines but the n-bomb compounds actually are very certain ergic as well so they can actually poison you too so what young win stock is saying is you remember 10 years ago we would say take half a pill and see what the effect was and then take the other half like half an hour later an hour later they're saying take a quarter of the dose and then reduce it to hours which is pretty cautious but you know if you take into account that when I suspect an N bomb over this I admit these people to hospital just on the basis that I suspect that they overdose on n boom and they'll stay in hospital for 12 hours while i wait to see what happens because one of the other nasty bits about the end boom family is that they you could look ok for several hours before the effects kick in hard I don't know why that is I have no rational explanation but I've seen it three times now and it's not as a consequence of mixed drug use because if I can test everything I test their we I test their blood and you know I'm looking for everything and it's just pure n-bomb so yeah that's if that would be one of the entities that makes me worried it's not PMA but stand close and I might just let mention to the crowd to with lots of contaminated batches of LSD with contaminated by nbome this summer l riches reagent will be our friend because you can taste you LSD and if it's positive 2l riches it's not going to be n bones so look I think there's been a lot of discussion about pill testing and I think there will be a lot more there's some very serious hitters now calling for it and as you know we were looking at this quite some time ago I actually think the way forward for pill testing in Australia is to up sticks and bring it down lab to a rave and that's kind of what were what I'm looking forward to do where we are looking at the color of metric testing of the novel products of the moment we've a project underway at the moment it's not hugely promising and it's a it's an exercise and logic really if this is negative then it might be that and you know there's all these sort of boolean terms in terms of working out what you got if I just got a near-infrared spectrometer to a rave that'll make life a lot easier and and one of the dividends of the glorious war on terror is a lot of the chemical weapons detection kits would actually didn't do their job but they were supposed to throw out there in the market for on ebay for no money at all so we can buy those and take them long to rates so that's I think what we'll be doing maybe in 2015 now for the questions I think thank you know you love you can see happy birthday you you"
Q2eXs4pCs3k,Former Cops Smoking Weed | Strange Buds | Cut,2015-04-20T14:00:00Z,
ZshEkGyOROI,Recreational Cannabis In Australia,2015-09-20T07:19:30Z,"Right now in Australian society, it is easier
for an underage child, to buy weed than it is alcohol. How can this be?
Well in its simplest form, Australia’s war on cannabis failed.
Not only did it fail, it never had a fighting chance It has now come to a time where we must, for the sanity of our society, regulate recreational
cannabis. Lets go back to the 1920’s, they tried to
ban alcohol, and by the 1930’s they made it legal, why? Because prohibition didn’t
work. It still doesn’t. Let’s look at when cannabis first became
illegal. In the timeframe of the history of cannabis use, it’s extremely recent: 1938.
But weed has been used by humans for thousands and thousands of years. The only reason weed
is illegal is economics. In America, in the 1920’s the came out with
a machine called the decorticator. It allows you to effectively and economically process
hemp fibre, and hemp fibre is the stalk of a cannabis plant that can be used to make
foods, hemp oil, wax, resin, rope, cloth, plastics, paper, and fuel and is extremely environmentally friendly as it is breathes in 4x the CO2 of trees and then becomes carbon negative. It’s an extremely great quality product as well, and has no THC in it, which
is what makes you high. But William Randolph Hurst owned a lot of
paper mills and it was going to cost him short term millions of dollars to transfer over
to hemp. So he starting printing stories in his paper about a new drug called ‘marijuana’.
This is what the articles said, people are smoking it, and blacks and Mexicans are raping
white women. In Australia, it was the same scare-tactic
campaign. So the government outlawed weed without even knowing it was outlawing hemp.
They outlawed a plant that has been used since ancient times without knowing anything about
it. Today isn’t much different, with all of
the pharmaceutical companies and alcohol companies not wanting weed to be legal, as they are
afraid they will lose money. There are many problems marijuana would help solve medically,
but pharmaceutical companies have all of these different pills that they must prescribe instead
just to make money. And of course alcohol companies are afraid of competition. Alcohol
companies sponsor many of the drug propaganda ads. These propaganda ads don’t cover health
issues; they are all about changing society’s view through fear.
The biggest one, pot makes you stupid, well not exactly. While alcohol kills off brain
cells, research has shown that chemicals in weed help stimulate the grey matter in your
brain, which correlates with growth of new brain cells.
Or what about, “pot makes you a lazy loser”? No you make yourself a lazy loser. Pot isn’t
to blame; people’s choices and actions are to blame.
Now I know what a lot of you are thinking: what about all the health risk of cannabis?
Well to be fair, there is little risk involved. But to start off, even heavy marijuana use
as a young adult won’t  ruin your life Veterans Affairs scientists looked
at whether heavy marijuana use as a young adult caused long-term problems later, studying
identical twins in which one twin had been a heavy marijuana user for a year or longer
but had stopped at least one month before the study, while the second twin had used
marijuana no more than five times ever. Marijuana use had no significant impact on physical
or mental health care utilization, health-related quality of life, or current socio-demographic
characteristics. Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Rutgers University
studied 408 males from adolescence to their mid-30s. The participants fell into four groups:
those with no use or low use of marijuana, early chronic users, those who only smoked
during their teens and those who began using it later and continued using the drug. The
early chronic users smoked a great deal a peak of more than 200 days per year on average
when they were 22 years old. The researchers found no links to physical
or mental health issues -- including depression, psychotic symptoms or anxiety.
Marijuana is often called a “gateway drug” by supporters of prohibition, who point to
statistical “associations” indicating that persons who use marijuana are more likely
to eventually try hard drugs than those who never use marijuana – implying that marijuana
use somehow causes hard drug use. But a model developed by RAND Corp. researcher Andrew
Morral demonstrates that these associations can be explained, “without requiring a gateway
effect.” More likely, this Federally funded study suggests, some people simply have an
underlying propensity to try drugs, and start with what’s most readily available.
The “It’ll give you schizophrenia” myth. Yes it is true; weed can bring out schizophrenia
in people that already have the genetic predisposition. However, It’s the same effect if that person
had a family member pass away or a bad break up because the don’t have the emotional
coping skills, all over the world since the 60’s pot use has increased every year, yet
schizophrenia rates have stated the same. There will also be money going into hospitals
and school to generate knowledge about your own predisposition.
But you’re smoking.  Obviously it’s going to cause some health consequences Well, yes and no. Smoking cigarettes cause cancer. That is true. But smoking is not illegal. Just pot. And researchers at the Kaiser-Permanente  HMO, funded by the California goverment, followed
65,000 patients for nearly a decade, comparing cancer rates among non-smokers, tobacco smokers,
and marijuana smokers. Tobacco smokers had massively higher rates of lung cancer and
other cancers. Marijuana smokers who didn’t also use tobacco had even less of an increase
in risk of tobacco-related cancers or of cancer risk overall then the non-smokers. The cancer
council of America have also deemed smoking weed to have no association with throat or
lung cancers. Think of it like this: smoking weed will help
you manage the pain if you do get cancer - it can be used in conjunction with chemotherapy!
There has been extremely promising evidence backed by the American National Cancer Institute,
and the US Department of Health, of cannabis shrinking and killing cancer cells.
One very recent study sheds light not only on how the plant could be beneficial, but
how casual marijuana use doesn’t even lead to lung damage and could even have positive
effects on the lungs. The study, published in the Journal of the
American Medical Association, examined 5,000 men and women over the course of two decades
– between 1985 and, 2006. The data also showed that high-use of the plant, about one
joint every day for 7 years, had little to no negative impact on lung air flow rates
or lung volume. What’s shocking is that there is evidence pointing to slight increases
in lung air flow rates as well as enhancements in lung volume from marijuana use.
It also has claimed medical benefits for many other medical conditions including: glaucoma;
alleviating the effects of tobacco; helping to control epileptic seizures;
decreases the symptoms of a severe seizure disorder known as Dravet's Syndrome; decreasing anxiety; slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s;
easing pain for multiple sclerosis; helps with muscle spasms;
lessens side-effects from treating hepatitis C and  increases treatment effectiveness; relieves arthritis; improves symptoms of lupus;
helps eliminate Crohn’s disease; soothes tremors for Parkinson’s disease;
helps sufferers of Post traumatic stress disorder; protects the brain after a stroke;
protects the brain after concussions and trauma; easing night terrors and so much more. Instead we have in our stores synthetic cannabis,
its completely legal, But it’s as harmful as Ice, its addictive
as meth and has the same health consequences, people have been reported dead from the synthetic
cannabinoids, its not a natural product and even paramedics are pleading to get rid of
it because they have seen first hand what it can do to a person, people in low social
classes who are afraid of getting arrested are using synthetic and ruining there lives.
Australian has attempted to outlaw this product several time but the produces just keep changing
the recipe. Natural cannabis legalisation would drop the demand for synthetic and get rid of it completely. The head of Australia's leading alcohol research
body wants marijuana to be legalised, to reduce the harm of drinking. Robin Room, director
of the Centre for Alcohol Policy Research, says marijuana should be legalised 
controls because 
the social harm associated with it was significantly less than from drinking. Teens were ""better
off"" on a mixture of booze and marijuana rather than just pure alcohol in social settings,
he added. ""Cannabis is not without harm but it's substantially less than alcohol and tobacco
in terms of social harm,"" he said. A new study published in Scientific Reports
of the US National institute of health, which sought to quantify the risk of death associated
with the use of various intoxicating substances. rather than focusing on death counts as others have,
the report's authors compared lethal doses of each given substance in comparison with
what a typical person uses. They found that marijuana is 114 times safer than alcohol,
114 times! What’s that you say? “But Lucas, we don’t
want people running around high all the time.” In Colorado, which made weed recreational
over a year ago, highway fatalities have been at a historical low. New US Federal data have
shown stoned drivers are safer than drunk drivers. That’s not to say driving stoned
is good. In no way I am condoning driving high. BOTH are bad. But we should be worrying
MORE about members of our community driving and drinking In Colorado there has also been a 25% decrease in prescription drug overdoses like Vicodin
and OxyContin as weed is an alternative for these drugs. The Colorado cannabis industry
is worth over 3 billion and state has collected over 50 million in tax, from which millions
have been put into hospitals, school and support for abusers Some of the money has actually
been given back to tax payers. There is more time for police to worry about
public safety matters and criminals than weed dealers In Colorado alone there has been
over 10, 000 jobs created and millions of tourists from all over the world come to experience
the new culture. Colorado has a population of 5.3 million; Australia has a population
of 23.1 million, that’s over 4 times the revenue of Colorado.
And Australia has one of the highest rates of cannabis smokers in the world. More than
1/3 Australians have smoked weed and 750,000 Australians smoke weekly. Every year Australians
spend 7 billion dollars on weed, that’s more than on fashion. 62,000 Australians are
arrested every year because of cannabis. That's 62,000 people that tax payers pay to push
through the courts as well as police time spent on arresting and charging and processing
them. It costs $100,000 per person a year to house
in prison, that’s potential savings of 62 million annually 
At the same time, legalization potentially generates revenue of over 10 billion annually
and creating many, many new jobs. So Mr. Turnbull, I just solved your budget
problem with that 1 step alone. If regulated there would be less violence
and crime in our streets. It’s time to put police efforts into public safety matters and takes the money off the criminals and into our struggling economy. People say you can abuse marijuana. That is true. But some people abuse burgers. You don't go around closing McDonalds because you can abuse something. People abuse booze. Don't see the pubs closing – do you? And cigarettes
kills you if you abuse them or not, yet they’re quite ok despite having NO beneficial aspects
at all. People die jumping off bridges, but we don't
outlaw bridges. Bridges like the Westgate ... Instead we built safety fences to prevent
people harming themselves. Having marijuana Illegal makes it harmful. It puts ""control""
of it in the hands of criminals. Making cannabis legal builds ""safety fences"". We need to make
weed a cultural norm in our society, make it viewed in the same light as alcohol, so
that it can be just as accepted and a useful a part of our society as any other regulated
and enjoyable social activity. It’s time to change our society and make cannabis recreational in Australia."

Weinstock study patients like John will monitored over four weeks to count seizures they will then receive either a dose of cannabis with a high concentration of CBD or a placebo and making weinstock study different he's looking to see how medical marijuana works with existing medications that study is the only way to get objective data however with medical marijuana becoming available to the general public by prescription in January the doctor fears people with epilepsy will rush to the dispensaries instead of working with comprehensive epilepsy centers and Weinstock worries that production of non-research medical marijuana could have varying amounts of CBD and THC THC is the compound that causes people to feel high to distill a gap between the patient's belief and available scientific evidence and this is what our studies about but for the Krakowski family medical marijuana could be the answer to give John back his life without seizures always hoping pray this is it on the head Reilly 7 Eyewitness News

FkcvbCBBCT4,Tony Bower speaking at the Sydney Medicinal Cannabis Forum March 2015,2015-03-27T11:13:28Z,an excellent idea on the whole issue cannabis in cannabis law reform in Australia for years the other party in which are the real thing of his tourney pal he's coming up and it was timely valid I reckon he's the bush heal up and he's lifted after itself really appreciated coming today plus use a tiny tiny bow from otherwise die from cannabis no I'm terribly look after a couple hundred families in Australia people with ATT for brain tumors in different cases a lot of autism providing robes about 150 families currently with their talks films and array syndromes that man where keeps seizure until they die basically what i like is a non psychotropic canada when teaching teacher at maple th-28 on which to the answer it is made from th do I especially create a plan that is really high into a TC but because of all the other cannabinoids are you about the time and what we knew about the cannabinoids at the time what try to bring them up in the highest amount without actually losing any so what we had was basically it with everything units it meant of equal amounts that [ __ ] can't really say that because there's no way knowing you once one gets to buy it stopped producing another where we start reducing the levels of are gone you can list the levels of different cannabinoids in different breed of very high way but to get an even level was what I've done for the meds that basically point you something through the government where we had an exact standard where we could run assuring TJ or growing message never change the point never changes like structure methods never change and we have Adam tested that there are very low amount of THC in you know very very obvious in it depends on I do several attractions so that sensitivity by saying that is in low bounce that he's in one it is in very little imps in another one it is a little bit harder it's still very low amounts to what food statement or anything else is that anywhere in the world by cross product with world below any food standards with THC psychoactive to you probably own food standards with saw a non-psychoactive of town HD IO acid we know there hasn't been a lot research into th cie back when I started in two thousand what I understood was that back there with you that two percent was tattoo in ninety-eight percent which th-28 we have never had surgery DS here so to the least amount of pro heating up it's actually caused by heat that human life that makes the plan to THC or simply do they will come up in even announced with some pre if it's grown under the right conditions that certainly does he usually private quite a condition or it'll milk are one is where if you have a look overseas but they talk about these CBP if you have a look outside from where they chrome I don't know it's telling it's frozen grounds or cold this is part of your insolence assignment in Tasmania you feel any different places you can go now by growing for the planet okay defining regardless we're going for the thanks is running very close together which creates a climate underneath the point so you have a schoolboy and you have the Sun is stop from getting inhabited planet you separate these plans up something together so therefore you ain't no way soon features reason they don't is because of the court appointment rising promoter of the method and growing and the thumb it stopped it's 22 feet so he had certainly do introduced underneath 280 on top people don't realize that they think that this is all happened in his ID and it doesn't because we saw it when I go if you know you about who assaulted easily stretch that far and he'll tell you what's in it he will extract the top are in the bottom part separately so you can't tell you what's in their energy and reason website we still have a 90 secrecy thca now ninety-six percent of this we've been told that th three does this does that it does no no else little try until said because it does that but they always say you have to have THC well if you have to have a tale to but i do not have to have a surgery team and we're just adding a glass of water to what only shallow just use the lower amount of THC that's what I use I think the best result of anybody in the world so sorry Doug that in itself shows and if you work out like I said nobody says that you can do this with a bikini they always say you have to have th City you know if I only work with one ounce of THC if your boy from the CBD and you are working with one ounce of sedation what's the difference in if you added water to me calculations in work you've had in water you haven't added a valuable valuable item here too it's too hard to get into the body stay very very hard again and smoke smoke source he know my charter beginning the system so it does allow to be used in high amounts and secretly so I'll tell you and edit the seniors it certainly do

they can't read something out if you continuously grow the same way that's why they stay up in until you prevent hopefully a scene again other people don't understand when you have it smooth you actually going to take all these tiny little me out you don't take on it and break ligaments are you from the block before any or leave it you actually undertake on variable bounce your body rejects not you can see in some cases everything that's taking on so we're actually taking honors is very very slow on them to the HC to do what you know perfectly in stone or recreational smoke because it's rejected and it's a saying when we taken orally or wherever we have a massive rejection in what we do so it's terror to take these in lower amounts they build these amounts up to stop their attention and we're not wasting it because if you use the method hybrid citizens whatever have said something like any team to send electricity point you've wasted enormity to save me of you used to be able to do you have just wasted a lot and here for one reason when necessary you wanted eating your body soap you may go back be on to something is not as strong and they all wear 32 body now your body to process it it can do but its leader and it might be what's necessary for you but you have to build any mount up you don't start a team coming up or never you know when you think about it it's a silly way to start you know if you start here put it out here what's happening helps happening is you fall asleep on then and you know wake up two days hell am I going to know is that helping you and you need to get some feedback all the time so that person must be aware of their surroundings what's happening so that you can get three back and you can build never levels up to where the bodies taken as much as it can wait we're four days before they take on war but you have to wait for them to get their levels before you lift anymore because what he can do is basin I am out straightaway thing in your massive rejection and then in some cases they have a real hard time taking on any take a signal from an external source after that because of the high dose straightaway in his needs to be India volume low blow low doses you know both companies life and science is coming out there the doctors of the sizes come here now all tell you that the trucks will be happy hour will work but we use them a hundred times since from you know a low dose response is exactly the same as a hideout respond there is no difference a high dose response will last longer so many if you are having something for cancer or but i think the low dose response will give each other some responses the Sun but if I may sir The Hideout respond last longer and the horizontal a dose response should always be used before heist so he should always use light out before you have avoided us because that means prepare your body for the next left hey that's for ten of those times that again it does protect yourselves it has a protective value in its own so if you can protect yourself through a low dose from a hotel it's a silly that's if somebody strictly you take a little bit makes it harder than any to kill you or distribute because you get this response against the toxins and the poison and tha works exactly side it gives you dislike that responds to you make you aware of the hideouts or what makes body more able to take on Chronos I really don't know what I can talk about it if anybody wants to ask me anything you just because we're moving on time of eating and got some questions to Charlie named David Stevens and a chance at all then I thought there's a couple more patients here but trying to stay here and we'll just get questions to people is a question for each other last 40 or so generic so with the genetics what you're saying with our certificates in law where you would start with one and two grains of rice oil and then work that up instead of working in the lower concentrate that you were to take more of that you can then absorb it and process the best anyway yeah what I'm what I'll do that makes it would actually be a solution anything that will break it back then and it will actually allow it is the party a lot better too because of the heavy haul the wtp door when I say this is back in there do you see unless you are just trying to make something psychoactive but people destroy any good product team any or whatsoever doesn't know what is will destroy you it will be no mercy but while the teenaged a local in Australia is around between two one dissenting opinion better between about violence treatment seen the same as anywhere in the world for simply pretty strong women it's pretty rare to get important we've got such a problem not being able to analyze and testings in Australia so there's this new amazing machine you can fire call the MX dy analyzer you heard about DJ pressure so there six hundred dollars we already won from America we are in a few weeks ago and we started testing all the different ways twenty percent THC 22% excellent a fantastic way then I was about the worst bit of where I could find still may twenty percent DIC so there a way you've got some bug would know my words each other twenty-six percent ta so awesome so it's a real problem nothing under testings properly we need leave Legionella good the American government comes out latest can absorb real world better for five years just to make sure what levels now the last thing of this comment from the American government showed that which the weather the strongest over here in a product or a boy Africa by the Mary Turner they have one breathe or think it comes up around six percent alone but mainly the most tenements everywhere is the only testing for psychoactive th lot of tests and were like Michael sign with this scene they actually gather all the tabloids and then they tell you do now all the gentleman which is not the amount of psychoactive is the amount of psychoactive you have to use a gastronomic test the ones they use now coming to be prepared like the police just put out a paper here in New South Wales a while ago saying average 10 per centimeter City man that's mr. Podesta try different tests them gathering different cannabinoids and in all those yellow and they say now we have said emergency when a psychoactive level was tested it was started one or two frequency yeah David days your day is going to come up now with dejeuner
tjwJpm063kg,Veterans hold medical marijuana rally,2015-11-12T00:32:49Z,some veterans want Texas lawmakers to give legal access to medical marijuana a group of veterans known as Operation trapped say it can help the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder but in many cases it's a safer alternative than prescription drugs we're very pro-life here in Texas but I question if we're very very much quality pro quality of life and that means a lot to veterans to be able to still have sociability because a lot of them don't when they come home anymore this past legislative session lawmakers approved using cannabis oil for Texans who suffer epilepsy but at that time governor Greg Abbott insisted the move would not open the door to marijuana in Texas

MASSACHUSETTS AND HUNDREDS OF PATIENTS HOLDING MEDICAL
MARIJUANA CARDS ARE BEING SERVED IN DISPENSARIES THROUGHOUT THE
STATE, INCLUDING ONE RIGHT HERE IN OUR REGION.
THE BRAND NEW, NEW ENGLAND TREATMENT ACCESS MEDICAL
MARIJUANA DISPENSARY CENTER IN NORTHAMPTON, OPENED ON
SEPTEMBER 28. AND MONTE BELLEMONTE TOOK A TOUR
TO FIND OUT MORE IN THIS MONTH'S LIFE WITH MONTE SEGMENT.
>> NUTRIENT TREATMENT ACCESS, IT'S THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA SHOP
ON CON STREET. MEDICAL MARIJUANA HAS BEEN LEGAL
IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS SINCE 2012, AND
JOINING ME IS LESLIE LAURIE, AND NOW YOU ARE HERE AT THE HELM OF
THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN WHEN IT COMES TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA.
NEW ENGLAND TREATMENT ACCESS. HOW HARD IS IT TO BECOME A
MEDICAL MARIJUANA PATIENT? >> IT IS NOT REALLY HARD, BUT
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STEPS TO BE ABLE TO BECOME A PATIENT.
AND ONE NEEDS TO GO TO CERTIFYING DOCTORS, GET
CERTIFIED, AND DOCTORS IN MASSACHUSETTS, UNLIKE OTHER
STATES, ARE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT THE CONDITION IS, THAT
WOULD WORK FOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA.
>> WHAT ARE SOME OF THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE WOULD PRESCRIBE
MEDICAL MARIJUANA? >> WELL, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN
THE FEW WEEKS THAT WE HAVE BEEN OPEN, IT IS REALLY EXCITING, TO
HAVE THE DOORS OPEN NOW, IN NORTHAMPTON, FINALLY AFTER THESE
TWO YEARS. BUT, PEOPLE ARE COMING FOR
ISSUES RELATED TO PAIN, ISSUES RELATED TO, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE IS
HAVING CANCER TREATMENTS, AND THIS IS A REALLY GOOD WAY OF
HELPING WITH ISSUES RELATED TO NAUSEA OR EATING OR SLEEPING.
WE HAVE LOTIONS THAT WORK FOR PSORIASIS.
>> SO IT'S NOT ALL JUST SMOKING, AS MANY PEOPLE THINK.
>> AND NOT AT ALL, AND I THINK AS YOU MAKE YOUR TOUR, WHAT YOU
WILL DO IS TO SEE THE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS THAT WE HAVE, AND WHAT
IS SO INTERESTING, IS THAT THE AVERAGE AGE OF OUR PATIENTS IS
47. THAT OVER ONE QUARTER OF THE
PATIENTS ARE OVER THE AGE OF 60. AND WE HAVE TWO PATIENTS ARE
OVER THE AGE OF 90. >> WOW.
>> AND ARE THEY PEOPLE THAT WERE USING MARIJUANA BEFORE IT WAS
LEGAL OR ARE THEY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW JUST SAYING, I NEED AN
ALTERNATIVE TO WHAT OTHER MEDICINES HAVE PROVIDED?
>> I WOULD SAY IT'S A COMBINATION OF BOTH.
THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE SO HAPPY THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO NEED
SOMEONE, IN DARK PARKING LOTS, TO BE ABLE TO GET MEDICATION
THAT THEY KNOW IS HELPFUL. SO, WHAT THIS PLACE AFFORDS
PEOPLE IS THE ABILITY TO TRY DIFFERENT STRAINS, TO BE ABLE TO
SEE WHAT WILL WORK THE BEST FOR THEM.
>> WELL, LET'S GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO
COME INTO THE TREATMENT ACT AND WALK YOU THROUGH THE STEPS AND
LOOK AT THE PRODUCTS. WE'LL NEED NORTON OUTSIDE THE
DOOR AND GO THROUGH THE SECURITY PROCEDURES, AND GO AND CHECK OUT
THE BARTENDERS AT THE BAR DOWN THERE, SO THIS IS THE FIRST
SECURITY CHECKPOINT HERE. THIS IS ASSUMING THAT YOU
ALREADY ARE A PATIENT, YOU SIGNED UP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF
PUBLIC HEALTH, AND YOU RECEIVE YOUR I.D., IT LOOKS LIKE A
DRIVER'S LICENSE. AND YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW THAT
MEDICAL MARIJUANA CARD INTO THE CAMERA.
THE SECURITY SPECIALIST ON THE INSIDE WILL VERIFY THAT YOU ARE
A PATIENT, AND YOU ARE GOING TO BE BUZZED INTO THE BUILDING.
>> WE'RE IN. YOU CAN'T OPEN ONE DOOR IN UNTIL
THE OTHER DOOR SHUTS. IT'S KIND OF LIKE, ALMOST LIKE
AIRPORT SECURITY, BUT YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR SHOES ON, BUT WHAT'S
THE NEXT STEP? >> WE CALL AT NO TIME MANTRA,
AND ULTIMATELY, THERE IS WHERE YOUR DOCUMENTS GET CHECKED
AGAINST THE STATE DATABASE, SO YOU WILL GET SECURITY
SPECIALISTS HERE AND GIVE THEM YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE, OR YOUR
GOVERNMENT ISSUED IDENTIFICATION, AND YOUR
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, MEDICAL MARIJUANA, REGISTRY
CARD. HE PULLS YOU UP AND HE SEES YOUR
INFORMATION, IS VALID. AND YOU ARE ALREADY IN THE
SYSTEM, AND YOU WOULD BE BUZZED INTO THE FLOOR OF THE NEW
ENGLAND TREATMENT ACTS, AS THE DISPENSARY ITSELF.
>> LET'S GO TO THE FLOOR. >> THIS LOOKS FAMILIAR, FROM
ANOTHER LIFE. THIS IS WHAT I THINK OF WHEN I
THINK OF MARIJUANA, AND THESE ARE JUST THE PLANTS THAT PEOPLE
WOULD SMOKE, AND SOME OF THE NAMES, LIKE FACE WRECK, THAT
DOES NOT STRIKE ME AS MEDICINAL. >> THE NAMES, THEMSELVES, JUST
LIKE THERE ARE, YOU KNOW, CABERNET SAUVIGNON OR TYPES OF
WINE. IT TELLS THE PATIENT, THE
CONSUMER, IT TELLS IT WHERE IT'S FROM, AND IT IS A TRANSITION
POINT BETWEEN THE ILLEGAL MARKET WHERE WE WERE IN 2012, AND NOW.
AND SO I EXPECT OVER TIME, THESE NAMES ARE GOING TO CHANGE OR
BECOME MORE INDICATIVE OF THE MEDICINAL QUALITIES OF IT.
BUT FOR SOMEBODY THAT WALKS IN, ALL THEIR LIFE --
>> BY A PSEUDONYM, SO -- >> AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE
WE ARE IN AN OPIOID CRISIS, IN THIS AREA AND A LOT OF THAT
STEMS FROM LEGAL PRESCRIPTIONS OF OPIOIDS, THAT THEN PEOPLE ARE
GOING, TURNING TO STREET DRUGS LIKE HEROIN AND DYING.
IS THIS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE SUM OF THOSE SAME THINGS THAT
COULD BE PRESCRIBED, OPIATES FROM DOCTORS, AND IS THERE A
DANGER ASSOCIATED WITH ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS IN THE SAME WAY
THAT THERE IS A DANGER WITH OPEN OITDZ?
>> THAT'S A GREAT POINT. THIS IS AN EPIDEMIC.
IT'S NOTHING SHORT OF AN EPIDEMIC.
GOVERNOR BAKER HAS SPOKEN TO THIS AND HAS MADE THE LINK
BETWEEN OPIOID ABUSE AND THE POTENTIAL SUBSTITUTION BY LESS
HARMFUL MEDICAL MARIJUANA, AND THAT CERTAINLY IS SOMETHING
WHICH I THINK, YOU KNOW, IS ONE OF THE UNEXPECTED CONSEQUENCES
OF REGULATING MEDICAL MARIJUANA, AND IN FACT, THE JOURNAL OF THE
AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, JUST LAST YEAR, ISSUED A REPORT
SAYING THAT IN STATES THAT HAVE LEGAL MEDICAL MARIJUANA, OPIOID
OVERDOSES HAVE FALLEN BY 25%. NOW, IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT, IN
2016, ON THE BALLOT, WILL BE A QUESTION ABOUT FULL
LEGALIZATION, OF MARIJUANA, AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR A PLACE
LIKE NETA? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SEEN
ANOTHER JURISDICTION, IN WASHINGTON STATE AND IN
COLORADO, THAT THE TWO SYSTEMS OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA, AND ADULT
USE CAN CO-EXIST. THEY ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.
FIRST, THIS IS A MEDICINE, AND IT IS NOT TAXED, YOU KNOW.
RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA, DON'T USE MARIJUANA, IS GOING TO BE
TAXED, UP TO 15%. THE TYPE OF STRAINS, THE TYPE OF
GENETICS THAT ONE GROWS FOR A MEDICAL MARIJUANA PATIENT ARE
DIFFERENT, THAN YOU WOULD GROW FOR A RECREATIONAL PATIENT.
I THINK, THIS SHOWS THAT RESPONSIBLE REGULATIONS CAN
WORK. THAT, YOU KNOW, A CITY CAN
REGULATE THIS IN A SAFE MANNER FOR PUBLIC SAFETY, AND THAT
PEOPLE GO TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY, AND SO, I THINK THAT THERE ARE
SOME LESSONS TO BE LEARNED."

sQAgJfHiSDE,"CBD Luke, The Medical Cannabis Workshop Nimbin",2015-09-09T22:34:22Z,CBD Luke is coming up to talk over here look and he's been a bit of hope he's been a bit hesitant to come up and talk but he's come over he's got his life on the edge on the line he's a really brave man and I hope he's going to tell us what's happening with cbt and what's not happening with it so I wore this jacket today because has obviously a lot of questions around cannabis as a lot of questions around cancer how it works as a lot of questions is around legalization well in terms of how it works I don't really know more than anyone else does in terms of is it going to be legalized I absolutely sure that we are on the brink of this edifice of idiocy collapsing and that will soon be able to do it very normally and it will just be a part of our system I'm sure that we've all got we all kind of got a bit of shell shock from this drug war that's been meted out on people and their well-being for so long and I just want to say that I'm totally positive that we're on the brink of a very new age and yeah good and does cannabis cure cancer last time I was here I said I don't really know if cannabis is going to be really effective in curing cancer and i just wanted to say that in terms of that question i absolutely think cannabis can and does kill cancer i'm absolutely sure of it because of now seen several cases of people who weren't doing anything else other than taking cannabis medicine so an hour fully cleared of cancer and that is that's super exciting and you know there's a lot of other things to add in around holistic practices that are absolutely important the last two speakers from absolutely wonderful in their kind of balance of viewpoints of how we can approach our health as being a holistic thing but I certainly think that cannabis I have seen people approach cannabis positively and negatively and still get amazing results so it in itself has extremely powerful and effective ways of healing people so I'm going to a lot of what I was going to talk about today has been talked about already so SAT here while well things have been going on I've write down a bunch of things that I just like to say and share with you so I'm going to refer to this a bit and that'll also help my stage fright so I just wanted to agree with Andrew wholeheartedly that you know the the death of of good information and of progress is of dogma and saying that I've got the whale this is the way and I think we can all just stay really open-minded around the potentials here and share as much information as we can try not to try not to you know put patents on everything try and just really understand that way in such infants we really are we're taking our first steps here and we'll grow up and I'll stand up and we'll have this huge breadth of knowledge and the only way that that happens is to share it so everyone share as much as you can you know I said last time here that you know best we can hope to be kind of a conductor of a symphony that's already playing well I've taken a step back from that and I'm not a conducting or the symphony I'm well I think we're kind of the audience and this there's a super intelligence and cohesion of all the cannabinoids phytonutrients and depending on our cosmic your own I believe in plant consciousness of plan consciousness driving this thing so so that's where I'm at now is realizing that I'm part of an audience and I really love what I'm seeing so what Andrew said before around the tumor is having cb1 and cb2 receptors something came to me there is that you know I'm here largely to speak about CBD but I really really want to acknowledge THC as well all the other cannabinoids that are present I'm not for or against either one I just see that they work particularly well alone or in cohesion in particular cases so it's kind of a tale of two cannabinoids to a degree here but you know in these tumors that don't have see one or cb2 receptors from the limited understanding that we do have CBD actually doesn't work through the cb1 or cb2 receptors which may be why resistant tumors react really well with THC and CBD together the CBD has different activities and ways of affecting tumor growth so the other thing that came up before is I've just questions that i have is why do we just want the why do we just want the cannabinoids why not the phytonutrients why we so hooked on just getting out the cannabinoids when the plan itself is a whole plant whole plant extracts I think should be welcomed and mixtures of cvd CB geez CB a/c be th CA all of these things is that it's kind of like loading up it's it's a it's a really rough metaphor but if you've got it you know a 22 in which you load one thing in and shoot a target you lot less likely to hit it then if you stick lots of different things in the end of your shotgun and you get a scatter effect so all of these things working together really important isolates aren't aren't fantastic in my opinion there was one thing that I thought I just wanted to address around biovail ability that was mentioned before but got moved on from is that is the putting it in as a suppository whether it affects the liver or not due to how far you put it in there what it certainly does is it boosted by Avilan bioavailability greatly this is evidenced by all sorts of trials that have nothing to do at all with cannabis these have been going on for a long period of time so suppositories are a really good thing I personally and you know one of the cases that I'm going to address because I just want to kind of speak the science and and other things and cosmology been addressed really well here but I just wanted to add some some human cases that you know of myself of other people around me and one of them who I spoke to just last night she gave me a call with her results back and she has brain lesion cancer she has lymph node cancer and she has lunch mccann sir and she's been doing we decided at the outset in conjunction with each other that she was really going to go for this you know that was her will involved here and so I supported her as much in every way to take it in as many different ways as she could so she put she has built up to a gram a day of THC rectally she takes a gram a day of CBD orally and with the MTT oils and and in the under the tongue as well I which obviously crosses the blood-brain very quickly and also in a vaporizer and she got her results back and so last night we had the the joyful conversation that her her brain to a lot of lesions is completely gone her lymph nodes are completely clear and her lung cancer is an hour half lung tumors now half the size that it was three months ago so you know the these stories that come in our beautiful balance to the you know and to be able to the balance that must be spoken about to we said it's just it doesn't work for everybody as prior speakers have said that such a complex array of issues present in anyone's pathology of trying to deal with these things that there can't be an expectation of a silver bullet here but I certainly have never seen one thing do so much good to so many people across such a broad range of issues not just relating to cancer in terms of extraction I just wanted to talk about another method of extraction that is available in most countries that are slightly more that are further along the path that we are inevitably going to tread in my opinion is co2 extraction so co2 is one of the building blocks of plant life as you know plant life is sequestered co2 so using co2 methods I feel is very is very close to perfect in that it's part of the building block of the plant life itself none of the other solvents do we particularly use to grow a plant but co2 it's necessary to plant life growth secondary to that once once the extraction is complete co2 is then reclaimed it's not sent back into the atmosphere it's reclaimed and and you are left with absolutely no residues whatsoever what if the plant extract is completely hold those nothing else you know we don't have to worry about or stress about whether or not there's toxic residues left over which of course we know is potentially part of other extraction methods so that's just once again I don't I would never say don't do other methods because we have what we have available today and the good far outweighs the bad in what we have available here in this country but very soon we'll be able to do co2 extractions the the CVD that I've been working with now for quite some time it's it's called supercritical co2 extraction and how that's done is a large chamber which is pressure capable is filled with plant material that has under seven percent water and then into that is pumped liquid co2 and then that's heated to 31.7 degrees there's the slight variance in that but then the chamber's pressurized hugely and what happens is the co2 goes what's called supercritical ago somewhere between a liquid and gaseous state and strips cannabinoids and other things from the plan which is once again a bit of there's some you know that was part of my question before is why don't we want phytonutrients what's wrong with chlorophyll why don't we want plant waxes when we talk about an entourage effective cannabinoids well there's also a whole plant there to work with in everything else that every other part of its constituents are in my view important so yeah so in terms of you know there was a statement made before that I just like to address you know with with my what is my limited understanding is that this I personally do believe that that cannabis is very adaptogenic it can stimulate and cause cell death or mitochondria of the cells to to arc up and create life so that's as that's very adaptogenic so if we were to extract from one plant high THC which we've got here in abundance in this country and add in another plant that is of the same species it's all kind of us then then these things are very adaptogenic if we can accept that then why wouldn't those two very adaptogenic plants adapt to each other that are so biosimilar and so that's my opinion is that absolutely you can add in CBD and THC in varying amounts to create all sorts of different effects depending on the issue being addressed that's how I personally feel that it's more than possible and should be encouraged in order for for a whole lot of reasons some of which I'll address in a moment I don't from my limited understanding don't believe that CBD is produced by by ourselves from CBG of these other things what is clear that is produced is an animate inanimate is a THC light compound and it works on the cb1 and cb2 receptors we absolutely produce that that's that's have been shown to be the case and what CBD does when it's when it's in in when it encounters cb1 and cb2 receptors it actually blocks them from receiving an animate or THC which then and causes breakdown of THC and inanimate which effectively means you probably all you know understand what an SSRI is an SSRI of medication stops the the uptake of serotonin through your serotonin receptors that leaves more serotonin in the body to become by available and in other ways and used this is exactly the same mechanisms that happen with with CBD and THC is that the THC it's it's definitely in my opinion part of the reason why the two together are greater than the sum of their parts because it makes the THC far more bye-bye for far longer than in and then in isolation which I think will lead to instead of the need for such huge high doses of THC once we introduced CBD will be Auto with time science and my understanding work out the ratio is to introduce sipadan THC together so we don't need to go on the very psychotropic journey that a 60 gram in 90 day experience induces I did it myself at the start a couple years ago and I started doing this I did the 60 grams in 90 days to understand what I've been doing to people and I already have a super high tolerance to cannabis of smoked cannabis since I was 15 and up to and you know a quarter of an ounce a day very regularly until a couple of years ago until I started to understand the medicinal context and work with oils and also just understand myself better I am you know so I you know I I can see that with time will understand things a lot better and I just what i can say definitely is from the science but also my understanding experience of sitting with now a lot of people that have been through I've been through our dispensary system is that's a CBD greatly attenuates effects of THC high so I I can absolutely say that in that regardless of whether you believe one or other is better that adding in the two together creates the environment for you to be up take for you to be able to uptake THC so if you're a tac proponent well then just adding the TAC where do you think it's going to work on orders of medicine and will absolutely allow you to take enough THC to be effective so that's for sure okay I wanted to just also say on a point in that dr. Andrew catalyst made that I personally really do believe there is an issue with high THC strains and the the reason I believe that is my own experience with it and lots of other people that I've seen and not becoming more well using super high THC strains what I do see is a lot of the people that I've treated I work in some drug rehab at work in mental health I've seen that people who were having an issue with smoking too much and becoming dissociated becoming paranoid and these other things is that if you add in some CBD then you ameliorate those effects so you balance it greatly so whilst I don't have a problem with high THC I think it's got to be balanced up with higher CBD and now there's amazing seed banks overseas where CBD is being bred back in there is also pointing that was addressed before CBD was present in strains for a long time and it wasn't until very recently that we started breeding CBD out using polyploid breeding and other techniques where you wipe out a lot of the genetics and then what's left of these super high nutrient and water absorbing strains that get very big and that have super high THC this was a commercial issue that happened just the same as hemp strains were bred for particular attributes for commercial purposes so is why we've got 90 why we've got no CBD left in Australian zhis it's simply because commercialization of weed has brought and the seed banks and all these things abroad this drive for really high THC and we we actually up take all these other cannabinoids and turn them into THC so I don't have a problem with THC at all but an imbalance it certainly is a problem and I believe it can absolutely trigger mental health issues and if if this and if there's too much of that I think it can also actually create it over time depending on your disposition and a whole lot of other things but so I'm just calling for balance that's that's all really in our proach to in our approach to these understandings obviously the drug war itself is the major issue I think we all agree on that that the environment itself is sick leading to a lot of the issues that arise around cannabis being prevalent because a lot of the paranoids and fears that are voiced by people who are unwell that use a lot of cannabis are very real there are people watching there are people want to take you away there are people on a charge you with things I've been through it on myself before and it's not pleasant so and I'll get to my current situation around what's happened with our dispensary shortly so just around the TAC versus CBD the way I've come to sort of understand these two things and how they work is is I thought about it you know and just try to write something out I just see it is it's like a very it's like a marriage of two people you know a functional marriage of course of two therapists who are individually very effective in their own right and have a great deal of positive attributes but in in conjunction and in symbiosis that activity becomes far more impressive and occasionally also these two partners will voice what will balance each other when needed where the other person is in too much excess so I really do really do believe that the two are very important in most cases but when it comes to people that approach me with things like extreme bipolar psychosis schizophrenia and these other things and and anxiety disorders I do encourage using CBD by itself for a time CBD has I've it has literally a ninety-five percent positive I would call it a temporary curative effect because you need to keep reducing but around anxiety I've never ever seen anything deal with anxiety so effectively ever buy nothing and if I then add THC and there I get some mixed results depending on the person the place and the time but decarboxylated CBD is incredibly coming all the time to everyone and furthermore around the issue of THC or CBD there is kind of two camps in it what I would say is that CBD allows people who it have ideological blocks or hypersensitive to gain an understanding that cannabis medicines aren't all what they've been purported to be by them you know by the years and years of drug war and all of that that it gives people who are on the more straight side of life or just very sensitive have all sorts of fears around cannabis it allows them a doorway into this world and I've seen a lot of people who before just completely closed minded about THC open their hearts and minds and are now you know they approached me and said I will never ever do tht it's a drug it's this or that but I'm interested in this CBD because the medical world is recognized at its now scheduled for in Australia it's been taken off schedule nine that doesn't make it it's many more available at this point in time but a lot of people who otherwise wouldn't have approached this medicine are so all of us who smoke or who appreciate the effects of THC can just keep a an open heart and mind to other people who have been more being more affected by the drug war to you know say that we all kind of come together because that's what it's going to take you know it's it's going to come with all of us working together to create the best outcomes he is very important I believe so around cancer I just wanted to mention the cases of cancer that I've seen positively affected other than an her she said I could speak about her directly Andrew mentioned before about melanoma i likewise think that my nomas these things and in fact I personally feel that a lot of cancers if there's a surgical option that isn't too destructive to other systems in the body cam two surgeries are quite a good option obviously chemo and radiation have some really terrible effects and I don't support them but if someone comes to me I certainly don't turn them away because I've seen people do chemo radiation and walk away from it and spend years rebuilding themselves with with the CBD sth seas and be reasonably well so I would never tell anyone what to do i'm not a doctor but you know in my suggestion is is that is that if you're going to do chemo radiation then definitely do cannabis medicines because it can really help as far as surgery goes i think that if there's a surgical option there it's worth considering the reason being is I spoke to obviously we all know that tumors are very hard to kill the bigger they get the more so that is I spoke to a really lovely guy that I met at a funeral and he works in a crematorium and what he told me is that when a person when a person is cremated and all that's we will think that what's left is ashes it's not the case is that what's left over is the husk and shell of tumors and the ash of the body so this gives us some idea of how hard these things are and so if we can start from dealing with a very small p it's it's easier to deal with you know the people that I've seen really deal with cancer very clear people in the early stage is part of the reason I believe this is true as just that how hard those things are so it's that's that's my thing around surgery I have a really lovely our bloke who really didn't want anything to do with cannabis and his doorway in was through he had a melanoma at big melanoma on his arm it was 15 centimeters long and they cut it out and his son who I'd helps offered a strong addiction to xanax with the world of Medicine had helped offer strong addictions a xanax he had convinced his dad well if you're not willing to take it if you're not willing to change it consciousness if you're not willing to go there at all how about when they cut it open we'll just smear oil on the on the suture points and the the fellow agreed to do that and so he smeared it on there for several weeks they went back they what they do is with these melanomas and so forth if it's a big enough cut they'll open it back up again to see if any was left so he smeared it on there and they they told the doctors and when the doctors cut it open they were amazed to see that not only was there not it was the wound healed in a way that was really not regular for an old person I said you've healed up like a 15 year old would but subsequently to that we can't see there was ever a tumor present here this opened his mind to the possibilities here and because they had subsequently discovered that he had he had indicative rise of cancer counts on his lymph in his lymph nodes in part of his system he then did a course of he still wouldn't take the THC but he did a course of CBD and in six weeks he absolutely had completely cleared that with the blessing of his doctors so just a little shout out and out all the doctors and oncologists that refer to us quite regularly now who have got a super open mind about this the people in the hospices that are you know the kind of the secret's out and I think it's it's on the verge of full acceptance I truly do because of the kind of people that were being referred to that are being referred to us and the kind of people that are referring people to us and a lot of really old people too so absolutely love that good on you and it's great a lady in Hungary who has had a melanoma she must have been on holidays it's not that much Sun in hungry but she she got melanoma and she's been applying th sell directly to the skin and it's it has gone completely this is I will need to ask Angela about his opinions of whether if it's cleared completely on the top whether that could mean they're still roots there he brought up a really good point you know in what was a wonderful talk alright so i will go into some of the other cases that I've just been a part of and first of all I just like to just start with myself if I see what time are you telling you I know it on the devil all right girl I wonder okay all right well I'll deal with these and then I'd like to just talk about the legal issues that I've am currently embroiled in Judah starting a dispensary online and going right out there with what with time so myself I don history with with all sorts of drug abuse some an addictive person i like i like peak experiences i really go with whatever i go with big time and that's a blessing and a burden but you know i subsequently from i led to heal myself from the worst of those ravages you know i had severe memory disorders i had add incredibly poor health I was suicidal I tried suicide at one point it didn't work that was really great it showed me the value of failure in life which is everything to hit oh so not sleep very well as have a very anxious disposition you can probably see and I'm being up here i feels you know they can miss something in that my liver was damaged greatly it was not well i did a lot of different things so i'm not saying that cvd tac I know Niles has been only thing that's helped me I've been on this I've been getting myself well and then subsequently helping get other people well for a long time but one of the key things that came along for me was CBD I've never had something that's allowed me so much space to balance myself I've just never had anything and that's continued to work for me and to continue to assist in how I deal with my outer world so how I interact with people you know I get I'm very passionate first and that can that can come out and you know in almost polar ways and having CBDs just helped me to be a lot more calm my partner is a lot happier with my family's happier and so and also just in terms of you know this is the culmination only part of a long road to but in terms of my addictive traits I just really don't feel like I'm caught up on any one thing anymore other than doing the best that I can to help people out with these medicines is nothing that i feel i have this driving need for and i'm sure it has something to do with the neural balance that's created so strongly with the with CBD my dad's really is is strongly bipolar he's so lovely to be around since he started taking CBD he used to take th see all the time he smoked for 40 years he would that would sometimes be wonderful for him and I think sometimes it was actually really unhelpful for him since he started taking CBD and he can he smokes as well but he's been an absolute joy to be around he's reflecting on himself in a way that I've never seen before and you know there's obviously could be other reasons for that but he when I ran out a little while ago he was within weeks starting to talk a bit like his old ways and so I and have reintroduced it to him and he's had he's had amazing results you know life is an up-and-down thing we all got to remember that you know when it comes to anxiety or depression life's an up-and-down thing in with us we can't take ourselves away from experiencing life and nor should we but for those of us that have either waged chemical warfare on ourselves or most of us a fab chemical warfare and our food or other things waged on ourselves then taking things that are really good for us and that balances is up there's nothing wrong with it it's not i think it's drugging yourself at all i think it's just assisting ourselves to balance ourselves against the huge array of problems that we're facing in our health as people in our in our consciousness in our bodies in our environment so yeah I'm backing taking the right things at the right time absolutely ice addiction and other forms of strong addiction that in withdrawal or the experience of or in control or create psychosis like States I found cvd to be incredible and applying this to other people to their issues I wish I had it when I was massive coquetting with drawing I didn't I had tipped out with it otherwise but I'm giving it to people that are coming off coke and ice and having amazing results like people that are they're able to sleep not have the the dreams like these addictions if given enough time can see it so deep in the subconscious that it speaks for our dream life and then that sets us up for the day ahead so if you can deal with it a subconscious level that's it's an amazing thing so dealing so applying CBD has helped a lot of people that I've come into contact with deal with what's really present which is there the trauma there the thing the reasons why though in the state that they're in so I'm backing CBD and sometimes THC for sure absolutely as ways to come off really heavy addictions applying it to people that are coming off antidepressants and opiates is also really wonderful of seeing great results there absolutely and when you deal with things like the antidepressants and xanax these other things what I've noted is is that I tried at first to bring people off very quickly like really quickly it's that creates a lot of confusion within the system that's trying to rebalance itself so whilst yes CBD and these other thing and THC are strongly helping this recreation of homeostasis still would be really careful about just jumping off things and jumping onto other things if we've taken time to take something into our self we should take time to take ourselves off it I just you know on a broader sense what I've noticed amongst a lot of my patients is I'm not my paper well then on my patients that people had come and need help then I mine but these people that come along what I've noticed is there the happiness levels in the family life is super important so as they distress we're talking before about someone mentioned about meditation wonderful thing to say it's if we distress ourselves that's when we all the natural hormones and all everything that happens normally in our natural cycle is able to take place and and assistance to healing you know this there's a great deal of evidence to suggest that meditation alone can cure all sorts of things and so likewise things like CBDT so you can put us into meditative states that allow our natural processes to take place so it's bringing us our own self back into a natural state that allows them the healing to occur and subsequent to that if the patient is distressed then the family can de-stress and that reflects back that's a that's a mutually giving and receiving thing that happens if the family is not so stressed out then the person isn't used to being dealt with in a certain way and so everything relaxes relaxation is key to curing anything really I've a one of my mentors in the drug rehabilitation stuff as he's said I can speak about this he had hep-c for 30 years his liver was his liver was way up on cirrhotic and they said so-so liver you get you can get Hep C and then you get and in other forms of induced cirrhosis alcoholism so forth drugs that you start at fibrotic and then you go cirrhotic and then went until recently you would you would generally died and the so I've now it quite a few people who are taking this CBD for hep-c THC I'll go back to CB NM @ t HC can be really good for liver issues but it needs to be done really carefully because TAC creates quite a little load on the liver Chinese medicine practitioners would say that you express living in a lot which is why you relax and calm then if you used to smoke in LA and you suddenly run out of pot suddenly yang rises because there's an excess of Yang and there's a deficiency of Union because you constantly been using that you need to relax out of whatever situation it is so TAC it's got to be as careful in in around the liver most people have got some liver issues to deal with I've noted including myself CBD CBD has this incredible effect on the liver where that you don't get a liver load from it doesn't matter how much of it you take my Chinese medicine practitioners now don't call me I don't present with liver issues anymore that's third in the line of things they deal with with me after six seven years of full-on treatment that I've been taking of the liver always being present I'm a lot calmer I'm a lot my liver isn't inflamed like it was and this is one of the great effects that CBD and THC also has is this anti-inflammatory effective things get if we get less inflamed we get karma things can relax more we get better so his liver was 30 he was given a trial of a hundred and eighty thousand dollars worth of this new incredible liver drugs that have been I get that have a ninety-nine percent curative rate on Hep C interferon is dead by the end of this year we'll have these new drugs on the PBS these things work I've seen people come back to life now this guy as well but anyway he was he was so deeply ill they rushed him through as one or six people in Australia to get this initial trial and we treated him with a CBD which to come off the morphine that he was on for a long time he then showed up to get his course of medicines they took they ran they run this complex liver tests and they said well you've that there's a huge anomaly here your livers showing 7 not 30 this is impossible this is a medical impossibility you're going to to come back and we'll do it again tomorrow and you probably won't be able to get these drugs you know under if we have to show this skin you can back the next day at the same results they said all right we're going to have to lie here because otherwise you don't get you you don't get your medicine so you know amazing result that could have gone bad because he's now completely clear of Hep C all together there is suggestion that see buddy might be able to cure Hep C I don't know but what's what certainly happened is a medical medical impossibility that as a cirrhotic liver could go back to fibrotic so things I realized times getting on here so people with strokes issues to do with facial muscles other muscles not working I've really seen some incredible things happen there Paul's these things this the neurology combined with muscular contraction that seems to be affected really well with CBD depression and anxiety anxiety the CBD effects something called adrenaline which which is part of the cardiovascular system it affects the way our cardiovascular system works these these receptors also affect dopamine dopamine effects pleasurable feelings sleep mood a whole lot of other things also 5-ht receptors which is to do with serotonin CBD effects 5-ht 1a receptors which which once again a kind of like a natural SSRI they block the receptors and they stop the downgrading or the breakdown of dopamine and serotonin through what the adrenaline and the cardiovascular but then in the 5-ht receptors so we've got this boosting of serotonin and dopamine a little soft footnote is that if people have anxiety you give them decarboxylated CBD cbda can induce anxiety and people that are prone to it for people who are depressed you would give them cbda because it's uplifting so these every person needs to be worked with individually order to you know depending on what their particular issue is to get the right result I think that's very important all right social phobias as I said before social phobias of people who do and don't smoke often people that smoke a lot of less social interactive I've got quite a few people who are challenged in that way who now aren't because I have some CBD they can still have their smoke which I support it's it's a really nice thing to have a smoke but it's nice to also be able to socially interact you know 15 years ago when I started smoking we're all a lot more socially interactive on pot and that's because back then they used to be more CBD present that's my belief and now we've bred it out and it's not and the experience has changed a bit but by adding a bit of cvd back into it you can still maintain completely interactive the flow of thoughts days is that self conscious kind of watching yourself kind of thing that I get is is certainly not pronounced or not there at all and allows me to stay connected I just wanted to say that in in terms of as emphysema was mentioned before I have a couple of people from the sorry Ivan refugees from the war a long time ago he's got a huge cancer on his neck she had emphysema secured herself of emphysema using using a mixture of oats for handfuls of oats I was running this really quickly but it's fascinating about these horrible things she's four handfuls of oats in pot of boiling water to leaders boiling that up for 20 minutes drinking that over the day a teaspoon of ethanol a teaspoon of butter and she started spewing out this black stuff she showed me all this it was incredible this this lady that had been through so much so much grief because of the war so much smoking and her husband who was a combatant in that war so deeply affected with this PTSD PTSD there on his we don't know what's going to happen with his cancer yet but certainly that his slept he hasn't slept since the war properly she hasn't stopped grieving since the war since all the terrible things that happened she's cleared her self of emphysema he's using CBD and THC he's sleeping like he's never slept before and now really happy with each other you know the tears when we catch up it so it's a beautiful thing to see um and so just I just wanted to speak we're really I'm just praying that this one to whatever deity will listen I mind but we've got this this guy this very brave guy over in Malaysia he'll probably know what the drug laws are like over there he was contacted me over a period of time and he's been insistent that we send him some CBD so I've sent him a concealed package it's on its way over there now so I just wanted to say how far people are willing to go to get better and just to absolutely support that and whatever way we can and I just really hope this over this one gets through from I'm sure it will but people are willing to go a long way here so that's what I'm saying about when it seems like this this kind of war isn't going to get one it absolutely is because everyone's health is affected at some level or someone around them and we all actually care and all the people who don't you know this edifice of idiocy and ignorance and so forth is just it's just been about propaganda and misunderstandings and the viewpoints of very few people affecting a whole lot of people if you want an amazing book on how the drug war was born and how it's been continued on red chasing the screen it'll make you it'll just it's elucidating beyond belief it's it's it's amazing how little that started how small a group of people can affect the world so negatively but it also in reverse is a very positive thing because you know never believe that a small amount of people can't affect the world positively and it's just all it takes is sometimes very small things and we don't know what these ripple effects will be so everybody do whatever we can and then let's let's do that so I wind up in a couple of minutes I feel really you know i feel quite delicate about speaking this openly and publicly because for a lot of reasons really but it's it's important to do so that um after speaking at last time I felt really motivated to do more I met people who were likewise motivated to do more and so we decided we were going to start importing as much CBD as Australia needed to do what it needs to do with it because there's no CBD available here there's a lot of good people doing great things with THC but there's very little high CBD plants available for people on nearly nothing and so we decided right we're going to bring in CBD in bulk and import it my I had the serendipitous meeting with the guy who was paid to travel the world and set up what is a merchant company for CBD they highly for profit and so forth we met up together and subsequent to our meeting he went and divested himself of his job and his shares in the company and came and started you know our our community-based dispensary our CBD oil Australia organization that is that as a non for profit entity where we decided we're going to knock the world market price in half and we're going to start in the country where there's currently sit where it's still totally oppressed so with this determination we back that up by the fact that he'd traveled the world for 18 months paid to set up this company he met everyone everyone in the medical marijuana movement everyone in the CBD movement and so we zeroed in on what is in our consideration the world's best most integris organic good manufacturing process certified CBD backed by a absolutely amazing guy called Henry Henry Vincente who started in dokur on the basis that it was a ham dinner he was a third generation him farmer and as he grew into a young man he being in locating often its young men are a warrior in this old heart he went out and became a join the army became a special forces member and at some point decided that he didn't want to kill people he wanted to heal them he came home and got himself a science degree and started growing hemp organically and so this is the kind of guy that has backed us all the way to do what we're doing he's never asked for any money up front he sent the stuff to us on credit he truly believes in what we're doing he had he had all sorts of awakening some things which I wouldn't go through here but he he basically has at the cost and exit the expense of his own market share within dhoka he's supported us to sell it at half the price so I just you know I can't sing this guy's praises enough but what that's led us to at this current time is we have had you know I thinking before like I know this that working with cannabis and taking cannabis as people say you know it stops it stops all sorts of seizures well I didn't have any seizures until I started doing this work and I've now had four in the last ten days so we've been moved against once again I want to be careful here to grow to offer a balanced viewpoint on what's happening because thus far the opponent has not revealed their hand but there is obviously within we've had 44 large large shipments taken in the last in the last 10 days at point of entry it's evidence from accidentally an email accidental hopefully someone just really cares an email was released to us that had an email thread because we have made all sorts of inquiries where is it you know this thing and the way that we brought it in was really thought safe and so forth and what we got back was a bunch of obfuscations about our they've got it i'll actually the carry coming in our customers use at all these other people have got it we've got no we can't tell you and then one of the carrier company employees sent us an email with one of these kind of nebulous rebuttals and it happened to have an email thread of about 20 emails long from other agencies to each other so it's become evidence it's evident that that there is indeed a some kind of process counting on with how all of our staff and so we're nervously but with a lot of heart because we're super determine when I want to stop you know we're not interested in stopping there's not happening so we'll find other ways and other means of getting it in and I'm sure that we can absolutely in ensure ongoing supply shortly our parent company overseas has for the time being said that they'll honor our price arrangement and give it to our people over here that need it we have some probably 200 people some of those people are in extremely critical situations that it's disturbing it's you know I'm it pisses me off no end that there's it's not in my view this isn't a hostile move made against me or the organization on part of this is a hostile move made against the people benefiting here the kids who are seizing the people whose lives are on the line the people who nerves are so shot that they can't have meaningful relationships anymore this is a massively hostile move made on the people this isn't about medicine about my organization this is about what's happening to the people and our determination is for the people regardless of what is occurring in our own system at this time so we already have things in the works of how we're going to deal with this but for the time being we can offer all of our people that they get there they get the vastly discounted rate through our parent company and dokur over in denmark and they'll honor that and we have an internal memo that was sent from a regulatory body to customs saying not to take personal amounts of CBD at the border obviously what we're bringing in far exceeded what could be deemed a personal amount unless you like two baths in the stuff but you know as so that's to not give you the full nuts and bolts of the situation then that's where we're at with our current availability and and shipments here in Australia but as I said we're not going to stop this no recourse to that we're on the edge of as I said before this this I just can't think of it in any other way as a edifice edifice of ignorance and idiocy and it's going to fall and unless people like us continue to do what doing and open up websites and openly do what we're doing without any fear shame or regret then then there's you know then we can be pushed back and so you know us in our organization determined to hold the line and we've had such beautiful messages support from the people that we've supported and and this will be an ongoing process and you know so I wish and hope and leave open the option that the people that are currently holding all of our stock in the various shipments will actually release it not wanting to pick up what is in a lot of ways I think a political hot potato i'm hoping that i'll release it and let allow us to continue what we're doing unmolested you know we have our stuffs lab analyzed its GMP organic certified it has extremely low amounts of THC what more could deal with the argument of all of this are a backyard chemistry and all the arguments that are put out of arts bad for the kids do so and all this kind of stuff that's being said we've circumvented all those issues with this with this product and yet it's still been seized so I'm hoping that it'll be released and that's maybe a idealistic vain hope I don't know but I'm hoping that is and so we're not making any hostile moves other than the inquiries that we've made we're now going you know son so out of war allow the opponent to reveal themselves because we've we're totally revealed we have a website i openly take calls we do the very best we can with what resources and limited training and understanding that we have in order to help people and you know CBD has been taken off schedule and on its on schedule for that doesn't make it any more available here because the TGA regulatory body that is essentially a it was created to introduce pharmaceuticals into the australian system and has absolutely no capability nor interest in involving herbal medicines that aren't single molecule functions into into a healthcare system that's who's dealing with CBD at the moment that want to push anything through with any great rapidity and it usually takes 12 18 months at best to get something through and costs up to a million dollars that in the bottom on the bottom side of that a tenth of that but the kind of rigorous attention that's been given to pop for such a long time there's no way they're going to push it through on the lower end of that so it's it's it's appearing to allow us I yes this is obviously medically recognized elsewhere and so forth CBD it's appearing to give us something that hasn't been given at all not one bit so until that happens we remain determined to do the very best that we can until products that have come through the system we're hoping that there's a medical cannabis regulatory body set up that hasn't been corrupted from the top down by the pharmaceutical industry and where there's obviously pull it quite a lot of political support for that occurring and I absolutely hope that it's sooner rather than later but until then we'll continue to do what we do and yeah thanks very much there's three websites I want to make them clear for you ready CBD oil Australia dot org community-based dispensary that's with one day isn't it basis community-based dispensary torque and the mothership is in dokur com en de Oca Craig and docker com CBD oil Australia torque and community-based dispensary talk quick that's what he's a pioneer he's a really bold man and Buddy customs in Sydney will be very balanced you

JEWEo5KR7vQ,BarChat: Medical Marijuana in Connecticut,2015-06-08T14:42:32Z,hello and welcome to this episode of bar chat my name is doug brown i'm the executive director of the connecticut bar association and here with me today is april erasati she is the founder and ceo of curaleaf one of connecticut's four licensed medical marijuana producers she is also the chair of the connecticut bar association's medical marijuana committee my name is april arizati i am founder and chief operating officer of cureleaf one of the four licensed cannabis producers in the state of connecticut my am also the founder and chair of the medical marijuana committee for the connecticut bar association i am extremely interested in the subject obviously as a producer but for many for many reasons um i wanted to just give you a brief a brief overview of the program and when it started we have had the the four license the four producers were licensed in january of 2014 so and at the same time six dispensaries were licensed or shortly thereafter the dispensaries are run by licensed pharmacists so the program has been in action for a little over a year now which allows connecticut patients who suffer from one of the qualifying conditions in the state to access medical marijuana as a an alternative or in addition to standard pharmaceutical products for their ailments just to run through the process if you are a connecticut physician and you want to certify a patient for the use of medical marijuana you can register online with the department of consumer protection there is a lot of information online to help you through the process so the physician would register and be allowed to certify patients then a patient with a qualifying condition condition would come to a physician and the physician would certify that that that patient did in fact have that ailment and then the patient takes the certification registers themselves on the department of consumer protection website and takes the certification to a licensed dispensary as i said the licensed dispensaries are pharmacists so the pharmacist can actually guide the patient as to what form of medicine what dosage of medicine how often to take the medicine and in that it's a little different because typically a physician is prescribing exactly what to take and the pharmacist is really loading that prescription but in this case the pharmacist has a more active role as the cannabis expert in some cases a physician can surely weigh in or if they wanted to have and they had the knowledge they could certainly prescribe a specific dosage but in this case in our state so far though the pharmacists are charged with really the knowledge of cannabis use and cannabis efficacy for the qualifying conditions and then the patient takes the product from that dispensary and we are the producers the four producers are supplying those products and one of the common things that people don't know is the various forms of administration so you're not just there is an option to have pure flour which is the smokable product that people are used to seeing but you can also vaporize that pure flower meaning you never it never catches fire so you never intake the products of combustion um in addition we have various oils tinctures topicals um there are edibles there's so many ways for you to ingest you can vaporize an oil much like an e-cigarette so the the possibilities are you know they're there for any kind of administration and we're really just getting started so hopefully we'll be able to to meet the needs of connecticut patients welcome april thank you thanks for having me i'm happy happy to have you here this is a really interesting topic that a lot of our members really care about it was january 2014 when connecticut licensed its first medical marijuana producers and distributors so we're about 14 months into the program what are some of the highlights of connecticut's medical marijuana program yeah so connecticut's medical marijuana program is administered by the department of consumer protection which is nice and different from some of the other state programs because they really have a focus on medical regulation so they're used to operating in that arena our program is currently has about three a little over three thousand patients in it and one of the great things about the program it's extremely pharmaceutical and it's really they took the time to outline a lot of scenarios and really give us a lot of a lot of guidance um as far as what we can expect and how we need to operate within the program uh one thing about the program that is distinct is that they have re classified cannabis as a schedule 2 drug so in the state of connecticut cannabis is considered a schedule 2 drug so what's nice about that is even though they have this very detailed framework that they've created with the regulations if you have a scenario that arises that isn't within that framework right you can always refer to how would we treat this if it were just a schedule too so they're using the existing regulatory scheme correct so you don't have to reinvent the wheel every time you just turn to you know a good example is driving under the influence if you have you know you have someone who's driving under the influence of cannabis everybody is up in arms how are we going to figure it out you know but you're not reinventing the wheel you just imagine okay what if they were driving under the influence of oxycontin you know they're scheduled to drug right absolutely how does the program itself protect connecticut's residents so the department went out of their way to really protect people not only people who are a part of the program so the patients the caregivers people who are in the vicinity of a patient who's using also physicians but they also protect non-users so you if you are um offending somebody else by using you can't use in a public place you can't use in a moving vehicle um they've really taken the time to care for to look out for non-users in addition the protected class the patients the the physicians the caregivers are also protected from discrimination in um in as a tenant as an employee um and as a uh um there's another one they protect against tenants employees oh and as a student so you can't discriminate against somebody not not allow them into an institution not allow them employment of course you can't use on the job you know your employer can regulate that right but um they went out of their way to protect the parties so that creates some interesting issues for connecticut employers that uh where they may smell and believe somebody's on marijuana now that they may be protected if it's med if it's medical yeah exactly i mean it that is actually one of the interesting program one of the interesting problems that arises not only in employment but in criminal like we talked about driving under the influence because marijuana is difficult to test for um it is stored in the thc stored in the fatty tissue so it stays in your system for 30 days so unlike alcohol where you can test the blood alcohol level and say oh you just were drinking this is something where you could use last week and then you go into work you get tested and you still test positive sure so that's gonna that's part of the reason that we really want to get ahead of the law here and make sure that we are anticipating some of the issues that are coming down the pike right um you know with with all the thought that's gone into this what are some of the legal issues you might see coming uh coming at us for people involved in the program right so the the number of disciplines that are involved are almost endless i mean it's really going to touch on on everybody which is part of the reason that i wanted to form the medical marijuana committee to get to get the minds involved to get everybody ready for what's coming if we use the other states that have legalized as forecasts for what's coming you can see that all of the disciplines will be touched upon some of the ones that are you know that off the top of my head are family law you know currently there's actually um a case where it's being used in a custody battle you know this is harmful to the children no i'm a patient so that's an issue that it arises in criminal law like we discussed duis and then and the like employment law same um one of the i intellectual property is an interesting one i think you know you can't trademark for example i can't trademark currently for on the federal level if they're going to say it's involved with medical marijuana because it's illegal ah yeah so you know state trade market can you federal is there patenting that we can do i mean it's it's fascinating my favorite is constitutional law because it touches on so many things so you know free speech as far as advertising regarding the product um the supremacy clause commerce clause you know is is the controlled substance act even a legitimate you know exercise of federal power so all these things are kind of coming yeah coming back and it's it's really exciting i'm anxious to get lawyers involved because it's hardly ever that you get something new i know a brand new area exactly are there risks for lawyers who get involved with with these issues so initially the bar was a little uh you know the bar was a little concerned about how we handle this because it is still federally a controlled substance a schedule one controlled substance meaning it has no medical benefit so but of late they have actually um amended the rules of professional conduct so which is specifically allows for lawyers to counsel clients regarding um the medical marijuana program oh terrific yeah that's that's useful for lawyers to know when clients come in and then the lawyers are wondering about their own ethical ethical risks um what is the likelihood of the federal agencies would get involved in connecticut's program right so even though the state protects all of these people these classes of people and lawyers we still know that if the federal government came in the state can't jump in and protect them however federal involvement at this point is extremely unlikely first we have the coal memo which was issued a few years ago which even though it's just a memo it really discourages any intervention in state validated programs okay um in addition there's currently there's an amendment defunding any intervention in state validated programs there's no money so even if the doj wanted to come in they don't have any money to do it and i doubt anybody's going to pull the money out of their pocket not these days exactly um and then you know finally even if even if the federal government were to come after states connecticut's program is so medicinal and so pharmaceutical that i think we would be on the we'd be under the radar i think they'd they'd be more likely to go after a state that is legalized recreational or something along those lines sure um and and really there's currently there's a some legislation pending the carers act which is compassionate access research expansion and uh state respect states act which would that's a mouthful yeah it's a mouthful but it would um well it's federal legislation but it would um reclassify cannabis on a federal level to schedule two okay which would ease a lot of the burden and and it would you know recognize state programs and although and really ease the burden on everybody so it seems like the federal government is kind of letting the states pave the way in this in this area yeah i think they want to just not stand back a little bit right well april thanks so much for coming in and talking to us about this and for all your work to help educate uh connecticut's lawyers about the importance of of this new developmental law thanks very much thank you i really hope people will join the committee i i'm anxious to bring on minds no matter how you feel about the program obviously i'm a producer but no matter how you feel about the program it's good to have all of these minds working together and hopefully we can end up with consistent opinions in our state absolutely that's that's really what we want to be about here at the connecticut bar association bringing those diverse viewpoints together to make the law better and to make it a better connecticut a better place for us for our residents i agree all right thanks april you
cEd8pJUHPxM,Medicinal Marijuana: A Perspective for Providers,2015-10-20T18:05:45Z,"I guess hello everybody my name is Shane Lynn I'm the executive director of Champlain Valley dispensary which is here in Burlington and then southern Vermont wellness in brattleboro and also joining me today is Bridget Connery she's our GM general manager for the dispensary she was also in charge of creating our edibles it is that help how's that is that better how many of you are health care professionals in here great excellent how many of you already have patients in the program great how many of you know the differences between CBD and THC a little bit all right good how about indica versus sativa all right and then how about did you know that there's different methods of consumption for cannabis all right great super all right well we're going to try to cover a lot of those topics today so I'm going to break the presentation into two parts i'm going to give you a little bit of introduction to the bigger picture for industry issues that we're going through right now and then i'm going to give it a little more about the Vermont background and then Bridget's going to come in and start speaking about the experience at the dispensary and we're going to talk about kind of four challenges that the industry health care providers state patients we all kind of need to be involved in to help move this forward the medical cannabis industry is moving rapidly it's changing incredibly fast the information that we had just six months ago is new and it has changed to this point for us at the dispensary we're changing incredibly quickly we started with two to three people we're now up to 40 employees we recently hired a HR manager we're bringing on a controller that's kind of the back of house at the front of the house at the dispensary we're starting to look at possibly hiring a pharmacist hiring a nurses other kind of healthcare professionals maybe social workers back to realizing that our our clients we sometimes switch between calling people that come with us patients versus clients we'd like to think of as clients they're your patients when they come to us their clients back to much of the science behind the plant based medicine is still evolving we're still learning a lot about what CBD is and what plant what cannabis strain will provide the most a CBD the plants themselves are evolving at this point as we start to breed these plants we can breed them to have more CBD we can breed them to have more THC we can breed them to have certain of basically ratios of CBD to THC and also part of that evolving science on using cannabis is coming up with those formulas for us that means we recently have licensed an agreement with a Colorado company to provide transdermal patches those patches are going to have different formulas in them they're going to have a THC to CBD a one-to-one ratio they'll have a 5 to 1 ratio some of them will be very completely non psychoactive back to the law then the law is changing rapidly to what you can do or can't do it's a process where you learned a lot at the front of the lines we go back to the state we go back to the Department of Public Safety Department of Public Safety's the state troopers they regulate our prog our program when we learn stuff we go back to them we ask them to help us basically change the rules and regulations so we can better serve our clients part of that is also the rapid change is a real disadvantage to the regulator's because they can't stay up with how fast things are changing and so we're really looking in the industry to help start to create some standard manufacturing practices that be the back of house back to the production of cannabis making sure that there's really standards there when we produce not only the plant but the edible products that we're offering the tinctures and then co2 extraction oil that we do offer again back at the front of house that means having standardized educational materials to be offered to people making sure everybody's getting the same message on how to use cannabis effectively for symptom relief for us and the industry taking responsibility is really really important to make sure that this program survives again back to the everybody in being involved in that license holders which is which is ourselves the state healthcare professionals and the patients we all need to understand the laws the rules the regulations and the standards of which we're operating from so expectations can be met for us again it's taking we're trying to take the lead on that that's where we really appreciate being here being able to provide this information we want to make sure everyone has the right information as we move forward so that this program is a very responsible program we develop this relationship with a state for us were the only people with the direct experience working with patients that are using medical marijuana we have to bring that information to you guys currently we need to be the bridge to the community to the state to the healthcare providers until about the experiences that we are seeing every day at the dispensary for us that's a matter of really also creating a culture of responsible use I think there's lots of stereotypes out there right now about cannabis and part of what we would like to be a part of is changing that those stereotypes we see a lot of different types of people from our community here in Burlington and Brad will come into the dispensary and people that have used cannabis before maybe for a long time for two people that have never used it before and so they come in having not used it before and have a lot of stereotypes and think a lot of things about cannabis and a part of our job is to demystify how to use the product part of that responsibility is providing transparency and to highlight that over in Maine there was a group main wellness which basically had a product recall a recall and they did that on their own and which we see as really what our industry needs we need to be policing ourselves and then doing a recall I think shows that our industry is growing up and that we need to have these steps in place to make sure that the products that we're offering are safe and have not been contaminated just some real quick information on the Vermont background there's probably roughly 1,800 people total right now in the registry program there are a thousand people that are visiting us at this point at Champlain Valley dispensary in southern Vermont wellness there's four total dispensaries in the state Burlington Montpelier Brandon brattleboro we are all nonprofits we all have a board of directors we're all vertically integrated meaning that everything that has cannabis anything that's a medicated product with cannabis in it we produce it in-house so from grown our plants harvesting them drying them curing them bring them to the kitchen to create the edible products bring them in turning them into concentrates which is hash kief co2 extract oil tinctures all those things we produce ourselves each of us each each organization produces their own cannabis we're not allowed actually to sell to one another so we each create our own cannabis products so we see about 40 new patients a month coming in for us and we try to do monthly outreaches to the health care professionals on top of that back to visiting people we're happy to come talk at your office we're happy to have an open house at our dispensary and sit down with small groups of people to talk about the program to talk about the products that we're offering so that's kind of an open invite in 2016 this cop coming year we're looking at changes in our program currently we're only allowed to serve one person at a time they must have a point to so they make an appointment that come in we can only see one person we see roughly maybe 20 to 25 people a day max that's going to change in 2016 we're going to be able to see up to three people at a time another part of that change is we're going to have delivery so people will be able to place an order with us we will deliver the product to them with delivery there's limitations though they're not going to have the same kind of selection they're going to have to determine what they want before we drive out to them so we see the dispensary is really integral though there's a lot of community that gets developed at the dispensary there's a lot of information that's shared their the delivery program program won't necessarily have that aspect to it and so we are going to probably most recommend that people have to come in for sit down with us we give them a survey get the information we need from them and then be able to deliver to them other part of 2016 back to have already mentioned transdermal patches we have other licensing agreements with Colorado and other states at this point to try to bring in other products basically back to we there's no product going across state lines but we're using their intellectual property their knowledge and we're licensing that to make products here in the state the one part about cannabis that we really think is a huge benefit is the diversity of products that can be offered to a client you can have dried flower you can have an edible you can have a tincture you can have an oil basically and so that those diversity of products could be used in a wide wide range of ways and I'm going to let Bridget actually talk about some of that and let her describe what the experience is like coming to the dispensary for the patient one of the products there that they are able to use and then I think Richardson also to talk about testing we test all of our products at this point so that we do know what the THC levels what the CBD levels are what those ratios are so all that Bridget go from go from here I have another slide I do have one last slide back to this information is collected from the registry and as you can see major diseases cancer major symptom is pain of seventy-six percent there's other diseases cancer AIDS MS and then you'll see other down there the other is epilepsy neuropathy ALS cystic fibrosis debilitating arthritis and then we see a lot of traumatic injuries people that have been in accidents that have you know serious disabilities with a lot of pain associated with that again so the symptom is paying there so all right Bridget hi can you hear me okay I I came to work for cvd my background is in food production I've been running commercial kitchens for about 20 years and the quality control that goes along with that and safe manufacturing processes for food products I've also been studying medicinal herbs for about 12 to 15 years making different tinctures abs and those things for the communities that I've lived in I did not come to this with cannabis experience so we have drawn on my knowledge and then knowledge from other states and people who have been active in this industry prior to us to help us get us up to speed on how to process cannabis to make effective products we are not health care professionals and I think that's really important we just spoke in front of the New Hampshire Medical Society last week they invited us to come because they have a program now that they're developing licenses have been given and that the medical community there wants to understand what's coming their way and it was actually enjoyable for us to have we spoke in front of them they were cannabinoid researchers from around the country there were doctors working at dartmouth-hitchcock they had a legal perspective about doctors risks or supposed risks in terms of recommending or prescribing cannabis and so to have the researchers and the doctors get up there and say we don't know we don't know we don't know what's comforting because we don't either you know we we can represent our products that we make and because we're vertically integrated we can tell you every step of the way what's happened to them from the moment they were planted as a seed or as a clone straight all the way up to their package and deliver to the dispensary we know what the mediums they were grown in we know everything about that product so what we don't know is that this is an unsettled science because it's federally illegal people have not been able to study it researchers universities stock organizations they they don't have the science supporting all of the anecdotal evidence that is out there and there's an incredible amount of anecdotal evidence what we do know is that every product behaves differently in every body so our job at the dispensary is to help people navigate the products based on the tendencies that they have and how people have generally used them in the past but our goal is to say this is your journey this is your trial and error process to figure out what's going to work well for you we can't tell you we can't tell you this product is going to help you with your pain management and you need to take three drops five times a day that's not how it works that can be very unsettling for people who are used to that model of being told exactly what to take so that being said the role of the physician the state of Vermont they have a verification process the position or the healthcare provider doesn't actually recommend or prescribe cannabis all they need to do is verify the qualifying condition and verify that they've been treating that patient for at least six months there is a new rule that actually allows for health care providers to verify without the six months in cases of new diagnoses that are terminal or sudden like a traumatic injury so that six months can go away if it's a new new situation that needs help immediately so the patient right now is responsible for taking their form to their doctor to get signed and get verified that the physicians do not have to sign it there is no law that says if they if the patient actually has a six-month relationship with them and I have the qualifying condition the doctor does not have to sign it and we run into that a lot we have people who call us and say hey I have a qualifying condition I have this relationship but my doctor won't sign it what do I do we're not in the position to recommend doctors so they really do need to try to find another doctor we don't share you know the doctors names of people we don't even know them all the time do have a survey that people fill out if they want to say with their doctor is they can but we don't share that with anybody so they take the form it's on the website which is the Vermont criminal information center is actually runs the medical marijuana registry so you go to that site you pick the registry and all the forms that a patient or a physician would need or on there as well as all of the rules and how the statute was written word for word so it's a great website to reference so they get their doctor the Senate form then I have to fill out an application the application with the verification form goes to the Department of Public Safety as Shane said it's the state police who run our program that's the only state in the country that has a program that's run by the Public Safety Office usually it's the Department of Health and in some cases the Department of Commerce so once the application reaches the Department of Public Safety they follow up on it they follow up with a doctor's office and they make sure that that that is a real verification form and all the information on there is correct once that's done the person gets registered and then they need to choose a dispensary unlike other states where once you're on the registry you can shop at any dispensary that's licensed to dispense in the state of Vermont you need to choose a dispensary and you can only use that dispensary for the next 90 days you're locked into that choice after that you can choose another one and then you're locked into that choice for 90 days so you know we think it's important that that people have that choice because because we're vertically integrated we're not necessarily going to have the product that's going to work for that patient so it is good that they can switch at least after the 90 day period so we get a list every week from the state every Friday the department Public Safety sends us a list with updating all the changes that may have been made to our previous list and all the new clients who have chosen us once we have that list most of the time we've actually already gotten a call from the person saying hey I'm on the registry what do I do if they haven't then we reach out to them proactively in that first initial phone call we talk to the patient about just the basics of what they need to bring for us to serve them at the first appointment they need to bring their registration card they need to bring that every single time or we will not serve you the first time you also need to bring another government issued photo ID that helps us to verify your identity after the first appointment you don't need to bring that ID we make copies of both and we have to have them on site all the time in order to serve a person just to be clear we do go back and forth between patient because we're not health care professionals as Shane said so we try to refer to them as clients but I will go back and forth just out of habit because the state calls some patients too and we need to call them patients when we reference them when we have communication with the state we don't reference people by name we reference them by their patient number for privacy purposes so in that initial conversation we talked about the two ID cards that they need to bring we talked to them about the fact they need to bring a locked container the law states that they cannot take away their purchases from our facility without it being in a locked container so they need to bring that or else they can't they can't go home with it and then we have a bunch of forms that need to be filled out and if it's ideal for the person to fill those out and review them at home if they can by law we do have to provide educational materials to people who register with us so part of the initial forms are just that they talk about the different subspecies of cannabis the different cannabinoids that are being researched and what they're known for generally as well as a different methods of consumption so it's great to read that ahead of time so when you come in it's not all brand new there are also communication authorizations we want to make sure that we're protecting people's privacy so we want to know hey when we call you can we say who we are can we leave a message same way with email is it private what can we use what's the best method to communicate with you we have guidelines of sensible use we have a our privacy policy we have disclaimers now this is the patient's experience we're not responsible for your experience and sometimes and when Pierce people are our first experimenting with cannabis or with a new product there is the possibility that you might overmedicate and take too much and find yourself in a place that's uncomfortable we do have them fight sign that form that we're not responsible for that and then we have our symptoms survey and in that symptom survey we inquire about the person's symptoms that they're looking to relieve this is not a curative program we're not talking about medicines that might help people cure their qualifying condition so we want to know what they're looking to address and we also want to know if they have any cannabis experience so we have a starting point so that's the first phone call and then they come into the dispensary and we talk about financial budgets first off this is an out-of-pocket expense that's not covered by insurance because it's federally illegal so it's expensive just by that nature you know the pharmaceuticals are paid for generally by insurance this is not you know a person can buy their full two ounces and that could cost eight hundred dollars so that's a lot of money to spend a month not everyone needs that much or spends that much but there's that potential we do have a sliding scale program my law were required to have a compassionate program to serve people who have financial need when we first started it was just to pricing structures people who met the qualifications for the federal poverty level received one price and everybody else received the other but we quickly learned that you know it's not just the poorest of the poor who need help here everybody does because out of pocket so we developed a true sliding scale based on household income that allows more people to get some discount to help them pay for these purchases so that is available we also do give a veteran's discount and then we just talk about how much money that person has to spend in the appointment and we try to figure out you know with that budget what are the best purchases they can make to get the most relief for the money they have to spend and certain products like the edibles that don't necessarily cost as much can have a long duration of effect so it's trying to figure out what exactly they need and what works for them and trying to make it work for their budget we then go into talking about the different subspecies and most people who are familiar with cannabis have heard terms indica and sativa before it's kind of like the road map for how to determine which of all of the options have certain generalities so indica is known to be generally sedating it tends to be more of a body feel people tend to use in because during the nighttime when they're trying to go to sleep and they're having a hard time doing that because of their symptoms sativas are the the flipside they tend to be stimulating they tend to be more of that heady feel most people use those during the day that being said those are just generalities they can have the exact opposite effect in any anybody so once again it's a trial and error process so we talk about those subspecies and then we talk about the major cannabinoids that people are familiar with primarily THC and CBD are the ones that people are most familiar with and get the most attention THC is the one that's known to be psychoactive the one that gets people high but it also has a lot of effects that that help people manage their symptoms it's an analgesic its anti-inflammatory some of the high th streams THC strains are the ones that help people increase their appetite reduce their nausea so there is the psycho activity but there's there's also a lot more CBD is the one that's non psychoactive it's and tends to be known for its anti seizure activity antispasmodic it tends to reduce anxiety it tends to be a great pain reliever that's all the anecdotal evidence that we have and more and more we have pubmed docs that are documenting that that is the case for certain people and split certain illnesses so we talk about those two and we have products that are THC dominant we have products that are like one-to-one ratios of THC to CBD and these ratios are getting more and more attention more and more research finding a certain ratios work well for certain conditions once again it might not work for every person with that condition but these are research is finding that they do generally work for certain ones and then we have our CBD dominant products which more and more people are choosing that are non psychoactive then we move into the forms of medicine I'll do that on another slide and we always talk about going low and slow because this is a trial and error period even process even people who have experience they don't generally know what they've been taking you know wherever they've been buying it from they might not even know which strain it was they probably didn't have test results they probably didn't have the variety of products to choose from so it's still a trial and error Puri for them and you always want to take the least amount upfront until you understand how it's going to work for you so go low and slow small dose up front and wait and wait a while because sometimes the effect doesn't come on for awhile and you don't want to take more before you understand where you're going to be for a little while so part of the orientation process is getting to know the names you know the cannabis strain names that are out there I don't know if any of you are familiar with them but these aren't our names these are names that the breeders of the plants have generated and often they're very colorful I do appreciate that there's some humor and some of them you know I think humor is always part of the medicine but there are some that are offensive and I we don't appreciate that at all and neither do our clients so we're talking about products that have these names and our clients are coming in and because they're usually not having the conversation with their health professional about their cannabis use they come to us and they treat us like were their health professional and they tell us everything that is going on in their medical life we hear about all the drugs that people are using and they don't just as our names are so foreign to them the names that people are talked about for all the different drugs that they're taking right now their symptoms are very foreign to us we don't know how to navigate those names and a lot of the clients are coming in trying to figure out how to transition off those to cannabis so that they can have the symptom relief without maybe some of the discomforts that they're experiencing with their pharmaceuticals so the primary methods of consumption so inhalation is the first one inhalation is through smoking of the cured flowers or the concentrates or vaporization of those same products it has the quickest onset time so a lot of people prefer it for that because it can be a quick effect 5 to 10 minutes in most instances but it also has the shortest duration of effect 1 24 hours the oral mucosal are the sublingual sprays the tincture is the lozenges these also tend to have a fairly quick onset time longer than inhalation but because they're the cannabinoids are entering through the lining of the mouth and directly in the bloodstream and not going through the digestive system the effects can be felt sooner and they have a longer duration generally ingestion are your food products the foods and the beverages so that is your traditional brownies and cookies and things like that but it's also granola its energy bars there are dairy free options gluten-free option sugar free options all of those things because all of our part you know that our clients have a lot of health issues in a lot of Martin's restricted diets so they don't you know they can't handle a brownie so those have the longest onset time and as I said that's where I know a lot of danger comes we probably all heard the Maureen Dowd story where she just took too much too soon edibles can take up to two hours for some people to feel and so we always recommend if you've never had an edible if this is your first time using this edible all that you take a very small amount and you wait for a long time and you do it on a day where you don't need to be anywhere you're not going to be driving you're not going to be responsible for much you just need a safe place where you feel comfortable and we also recommend for people who are inexperienced we have a lot of people come in who've never use cannabis before but have a trusted friend with you the first time you experiment with these products just in case you find yourself in a place where you get a little anxious some of the products can create anxiety have somebody there with you to help talk you through it because you will get through it but it's helpful to have something there with you so the benefit with with food products I mean if you it takes longer to feel it but then once it kicks in it has the longest duration and so if you over medicate then that's a problem because you're stuck with that feeling for a long time but the flipside is that once you determine if this product works well for you then you have a long duration of effect and so a lot of people who have sleep issues especially sleep issues related to pain because their pain is waking them up this is generally the best option if they find one that works for them and we also we find people reporting often that they you know they're sleeping through the night for the first time because they had a cookie before they went to bed so that's always encouraging the last one is trop tropical it should say topical because topical can be either a local superficial application like a salve or a lotion that's really just treating a local area inflammation irritated skin conditions joint pain and then there are the transdermal patches that Shane talked about that are systemic they're generally local and fast-acting and they're generally non-psychoactive though some people who are really sensitive might experience some psycho activity with a THC dominant transdermal product so I just barely scratched the surface about talking about any of these topics and one of the challenges that we find is that there's so much information out there and the Shane said there's hope there's so much on the internet and some sources are really good and some are not and all of our clients are reading those things a lot of them come to us because they've done research on the internet first and they're thinking that cannabis is going to be helpful to them so even though we have a ton of information out there to read you know it's unsettled it's it's anecdotal we have a true lack of settled information you know and everyone really needs to figure this out on their own so that's hard so there's too much information at the same time as a lack of Rev solid information and there's also a lack of up standards across dispensaries within the state we don't we have the same laws that we need to follow to be compliant but we don't necessarily have the same packaging we don't necessarily have testing it's a whole bunch of different you know they don't have the same intake is us possibly so there's this differences and so when people are moving from one of the other it would be nice that some things would be the same and familiar because you know a lot of people have discomfort coming in the dispensary for the first time and it's really our job in that first phone call and that first consultation to provide comfort and it would be great if that could translate if a patient discovered that hey I need to go to the montpelier facility because they have what I need and they could go there and have that comfort of familiarity and that's also across state lines are 23 programs now in the country that have medical programs and States yeah and it would be great if there was some similarity and rules and regulations and dosage information across states too so we do the best that we can and that in this environment we do label all of our products with the strain that's in there the amount of cannabis that was used to create it's called the weight equivalent we are in the process of testing all of our products not all of our products have a label on it right now that says exactly what the milligrams of cannabinoids are we're working towards that there's a lot of as a huge learning curve there too in the state our state doesn't allow for outside labs to operate within the state the only people who can handle cannabis in the state are the four licensed facilities and the patients so we don't have an outside lab in the state who can verify our results for us or even to learn from so we do have lab technicians from other industries who are very skilled lab petitions but they're learning the cam annoyed profiles how to read them we work with other lab technicians from other states that have cannabis labs to get all of that information secure for all of our products so in the process of having labels on everything all of our dried flower right now has percentages of THC in them but not all the infused products do but we're getting close we do put them in tamper-proof packs and we also give all the the ingredients for all of the infused products once against people know what they're they're consuming we're moving towards having a nutritional panel on all of them as well tues that people can understand that the amount of salt fat sugar that's another product so they can make informed decisions once again the THC and CBD ratios are really important but there are many other active ingredients in cannabis so yes we talk about those because those are the ones that are most talked about but more and more we're learning that there are many other cannabinoids and other phytochemicals that are actually participating in the effects that that people feel when they use these products one of those is the terpenes terpenes are found in all plants there I'm familiar with them through my aromatherapy study you know it's what makes clothes smell like clove and lavender smell like lavender and they have therapeutic effect and you can smell those same terpenes in cannabis so there are certain strains of cannabis that smell like time it smells like oregano it smells like some citronella smells like rose it's all in there and it's interesting they're starting to learn that these terpenes that create these aeromotive profiles are related to how thing how the cannabis works inside the body so a lot more to learn there what we see on a day-to-day basis in the dispensary now that works is is that people use their sense of smell to determine which products they want to use and generally if something smells good to them that's the product that actually works for them and if they're repulsed by the smell there are certain strains that people they're repulsed by it it's mortar pinnock it might smell a little bit like gasoline or might smell like a musk you know like that perfume musk and that people are pulsed by that but usually is not the product for them so it's interesting how the nose knows that anecdotally okay so there are a bunch of doctors out there now and cam annoyed researchers who are focusing on cannabis research and all of them say the same thing we don't know we don't know we don't know we're encouraged by the research is coming out but it really even the the difference between indica and sativa now is coming into question like that's how we orient people now but now they're saying hey you know it might not be those categories that explain why indicas tend to be sedating it could be the terpene content and so some companies are you know the processing the the raw material to just create THC they're stripping or CBD or whatever cannabinoid they want and they're stripping it down to just that and this adding terpenes back to it they're creating formulations just one of the terpenes what therapeutic profiles are those have and I've been the THC and the CBD and they're making those formulas and labs so we have a lot coming ahead on the horizon dr. missoula meeeee if you follow ken of our research or research in other countries he's very prominent and these raley national program it's one of the most advanced programs in the world they actually have cannabis therapy in hospitals there they have vaporization rooms where patients actually go and they they've ate cannabis as part of their treatment in the hospitals he's saying basically the same thing that this we have so far to go and and isolating just the cannabinoids it just the terpenes isn't going to produce the effects we want it's that whole plant medicine that's what he's learning in his research these are just examples of the labels that we have we do have to have the strain name on there we put ranges of THC on there because you know this is plant based medicine in the plant when you test the plant you're going to get different cannabinoids at every level of the plant you can test a flower from the top of the plant test the flower from the middle test a flower from the bottom and you're going to get different results they're not going to be wildly different but they're going to be different so we can never say that this package of flower that everything that you test in there is sixteen percent it could be that one of the flowers in there is 16.5 and one of them's 15 there's just a natural variance in the way the plant distributes its chemicals in the plant based on its growing environment so we put ranges on them because people really do get attached to the numbers and we try to coach people away from that but it's it's not about the numbers it's important it's a starting place but there it's not everything we also use color you know as strain said maybe this is in our last because we just spoke before this when people are experimenting with our products we tell people to write write it down get a journal we actually even sell journals write down your experience when you're starting with this product write down how much you took write down what time of day was you have an empty stomach were you tired how are you feeling and then write down your effect so that you can better remember which products work for you and start to understand how you can take them most effectively in cannabis especially the ones that have THC in this like active that can lead to a hard time remembering what what worked well what didn't especially if you bring home 15 different products and you're trying to figure it out often we have people come back and they say oh you know like five of these were really great but I can't remember which ones they were so we got to write it down and we used to find that people when they're trying to figure out sativa and indica they're like which one is my daytime which one is my night time we found that we were like drones you know Suns on bags for daytime and so now we use color orange just tends to be stimulating the blues for nighttime and it helps people when they have these packages at home to navigate which product they should use one this is an example of another company this is a Canadian license company they use color too to help people navigate all the products this is a company that's chosen to take away the funny breeder names you know some companies do that they change them completely and they make their own brand names this one is metrum so the challenges that we face as Shane said we are completely vertically integrated so that has its own challenges we have to figure out how to do everything as opposed to being able to to take somebody to work with somebody else who already has that expertise so we do grow it we have our own lab we are on commercial kitchen we have a packaging team and then we have our dispensary staff the staff were not medical professionals we'd like to bring medical professionals into the dispensing location we do have a couple nurses who work in the brattleboro facility which is great we have a social worker who's starting to work at the Burlington facility a lot of our clients you know because of their serious health condition I mean these are really sick people it's not like Colorado where it's it's somebody coming in with a sprained ankle like we're dealing with people who are really sick and who have a lot of physical cognitive emotional issues related to their illness and having a staff that can handle that you know 25 patients write it one after the other who some days it's really easy some days it's not you know because they're there affected by what they're going through and so it really helps to have somebody who's got that life experience and that work experience to handle people who can sometimes be difficult or emotional who have a hard time organizing you know even having someone to help people fill out their financial assistance application that can take some of our clients a really long time to figure that out and so having somebody on staff who can work with them to get that done so they can get on the program as soon as possible so we're excited because as we mature as an industry we're attracting people who have that kind of experience when we first opened you know that people were risk-averse we didn't know if it was going to last people didn't want to jump in and take that risk to work in there so we tended to have a certain kind of applicant come work for us we were fortunate we found a lot of great young people who didn't have the skills that we feel are really needed on the dispensary end to work with our population and now that we've been here a while people are seeing the program working well we're finding a different kind of applicant coming in and applying to work with us which is great so when I have to come to can't give medical advice each person must determine their own dose over time we need standardization labels and warnings we definitely need increase involvement from the healthcare professionals we want to create that that feedback loop we do collect a lot of information on the front end we've been good about that you know at that first patient symptom survey there's a lot of good information on there for people who choose to fill it out in depth and most people do so we we have what they've been taking so far and how often and what their experience is and now we want to you know create what's the next checkup time and I think that you know annually we're going to start having it when you get your card renewed let's do that again let's start collecting data on how your cannabis use has affected your health and affected your your other medicine choices and uses and then another challenge for the patient is the renewal system so it is a yearly renewal and we once we see somebody's card is about two months away we start telling if you're going to reregister get moving on it now because it can take a while they have to have the doctor the healthcare professional Reese on the form so it takes a while to get that to happen they have to reapply with the state so patients often suffer gaps because they don't do it in time so we really try to get people like hey get on top of that because when they have that gap it's hard for them when they've come to depend on using certain products to help them with their symptom relief and then the other challenge is the fact that we are program set up for symptom relief this is not curative medicine here that we're working with it can be there's a lot of anecdotal evidence out there that people are using canvas products to help them shrink tumors and cure their illnesses but once again it's unsettled and we don't have the ability to continually supply the products that are needed for those therapies generally because we have limits this there's limits on what the patient can purchase every month which is two ounces and there are limits on what we can grow and have an inventory based on the amount of patients that we have so every time a patient is added to our registry that means that we can grow and keep an inventory certain amount of product these curative therapies that people using like the rick simpson style oils you may have heard about the high CBD concentrated oils the juicing the raw juicing require a large amount of plant material more than we legally can keep an inventory and yes we may be able to make these products temporarily but that's part of the issue is that most of these therapies that people are using then they're finding success it's not just a lot of product it's a lot of product over a long period of time months and we just don't have the inventory to to be able to supply the person once they've started it to continue with it so we get phone calls all the day all every day from people looking for those therapies looking for somebody to help them manage the treatment to they want us to be their coaches and that's not who we are so it's it's hard you know it's hard to get those phone calls coming where people are really hopeful that they're going to be able to find these things through this program right now and I'm not saying it's not possible but it right now I think one of the only ways that people might be able to do that is to choose the home growing option in this state we do have the dispensary and then there's a cultivating at home but still they're going to be hard pressed to be able to come up with that amount of plant material to have that process that they're looking to unfold there so we're dealing with symptom relief and the main symptoms that we hear about pain management number one sleep aids appetite stimulation naza reduction anxiety reduction that's a big one you know people come in with a diagnosis and they're they're anxious about that and so a lot of people use our products to help them relax and then the opposite this battling fatigue so I'm going to hand it back off to Shane I got a roughly five minutes to go but we got a couple more slides here the other change challenges back to hate a plant based medicine and back to testing and the cannabis plant you know we their cycles to the harvests and let's say a certain strain gets harvested at 55 days it'll test a certain way we may have to bring that plant down at 50 days or 53 days or maybe ask go up to 58 or 60 days so if we harvest that plant on a different day it's going to have different THC levels different CBD levels it's going to have different ratios the other thing that affects our cultivation is the seasons we grow completely endorse at this point but the indoors is affected by what season were in and so that that changes the plant back to testing samples Bridget had mentioned results very top of the plant middle of plant bottle the plant it's just the natural part of plant based medicine that there are these variations we've mentioned individuals respond very differently to cannabis we all have an endo connect can't abide cannabinoid system thank you and we have cb1 and cb2 receptors there in our brain there in our spine there in our stomach but we all respond differently something that may work for me won't work for somebody else it will have a completely different experience using that cannabis product so back to individuals Bridget I mentioned a person going home with maybe 15 different products we sell really small sizes of the products so that people can try so they're not going home with a huge amount they're actually going home with very small amounts of cannabis so that they can try different things to find the thing that works for them back to dose determination it's challenging you've they've got to try it they've got to experience it and then come in and talk to our staff and kind of go through that experience or their staffs of the staff can again recommend things but not we cannot give direct guidance on that so individual experience in the end for everybody that's coming in to use cannabis go low go slow five milligrams is the starting place that we think is a responsible place to start you go out west right now to Colorado you can purchase products that have a hundred 500 milligrams of cannabis THC act of TC it's a huge amount you're not going to die from cannabis but the person will feel like they're dying which is it's a horrible experience for them to go through and so to avoid that we always say start at the lowest lowest possible dosage and then experience it that way come back and then try again lastly just information and education the industry is new we're all learning we really need to create a feedback loop out there so that we could work with the patient's work with healthcare professionals right now we a person comes in a client comes in uses our product we recommend that they make another appointment with our healthcare professionals so that they can update their healthcare professional about the experience that they had with cannabis but if they don't do that that information is not getting back to the healthcare community and that's where we need to start creating a feedback loop here so we can all be better educated on it again I'm going to repeat it again low and slow it's where to start with with everyone even with people that have been using cannabis for a decade for them to come in and use an edible they need to start at the smallest dose and go from there feedback loop I've mentioned lastly we hear it every week people come in they're using cannabis they're using fewer pharmaceuticals fewer pain pills fewer other medications and we'd like to start to be able to have real stats on then so we're starting to collect this information we're starting to work with a dispensary in Montpelier to have a broader base sampling to understand what's really happening part of this though it for us is just time and having the to collect this information and then review it and at some point we'd like to then present it to the healthcare community here in in Vermont so that's that's a wrap but if you have questions we didn't save much time but we'd love to answer anything so thank you you"
1fFPw75z148,Can you be fired for using medical marijuana?,2015-03-11T05:21:47Z,yes unfortunately most people are surprised by this there is a case called Ross V wag Meyer it is the United States Supreme Court case that says even if your state and in this date in question was California allows for you to have medical marijuana if the employer does drug testing is still an illegal substance in the United States and since we are united states and federal law preamp set you can be lawfully terminated for that

in Australia. It's a real privilege to be able to read
the latest literature and see what's happening around the world and if we can sort of bring
some of that information in a distilled form to the health professionals of Australia then
our job has really been worthwhile. [Music] >> JOHN DOWDEN: It's a real variety, and that's
another advantage, in that I might be working on a comment about a new drug or I might be
reviewing a paper or I might have some correspondence with a senior professional about a particular

rewarding, we have a product that we know is read nationally, internationally, it really
makes a difference to healthcare, people enjoy reading it and it changes practice which is what
we're all about. So that's a very worthwhile thing to do and

XHtZYkYILsg,Celebrating 4/20 with London&#39;s Weed Fanatics,2015-04-20T18:47:51Z,"Lastly, do you have a message for David Cameron? We're not fucking stupid. This is a new England, and it's our England. Where ganja and rough chicks will exist, and
righteousness will exist. That's my message to the people. Possession of cannabis is illegal. Despite the best efforts of Howard Marx, Professor
David Nutt and Zane from One Direction. This sinister herb remains banned throughout
much of the western world. It was Labour who first upgraded it to a class
B drug, the Tories have kept it on the naughty step and even the Lib Dems feel we should only
get wavy for medicinal purposes. We're in Hyde Park for Britain's 4/20 celebrations. In the run up to the election it feels especially
political Do of the estimated 6% of Britons or chuff
the oregano dream pipe feel that their views are going to be taken
in to consideration? And as you can see the police are getting
some early numbers on the scoreboard here. Why so many cops at Speaker's Corner? It's not about the weed, it's trying to stop
Speaker's Corner. It's the cops encroaching on spies territory. You fucking pigs! Hardened criminals down for a night in chokey. We're not saying that drugs are safe we're not advocating a free-for-all, you know,
we're not saying tomorrow that all drugs should be legal and
that everyone should take them, and all the rest of it, no, what we're saying is that some drugs are safer
than others, and that should obviously be reflected in
the law. Who are your picks for Election 2015? Me! Cause if I ruled this country, yeah, you could
smoke bare piff, and get loud! 4/20, know what I'm saying? Come to promote the legalisation of the herbs. Is this a political act to you? It's more social for me. I think people decide on law, so, I mean, as you can see the amount of people
that are here, supporting the cause. Go to Camden man, it's like 4/20 every day
there, It's like 4/20 every day there. You can just smoke weed and blow it in the
police's face anyway man. No one gives a shit. Well, the police are over there, they're on the lookout for law breaking marijuana
smokers. I could point them towards a few over there, but I'm no snitch. I mean, UKIP and the Greens are the only two
parties who are pro-marijuana in the polls. ULIP are chatting shit, yeah, and the Green
Party, they're all really green, innit, of course they love green. Natalie Bennet said that she found marijuana
quite unpleasant. What would you recommend to make her experience
more pleasant? What I would recommend to her to make her
smoking experience a lot better is try hitting it through a bong, hitting it
through a bong is so much smoother on the flow and doesn't kill you
off as much. Is there a correlation between marijuana and
not voting? A lot of non-voters probably do smoke weed,
but, that's the thing, that's the thing, like, if you want to sit at home smoking weed all
day, doing nothing, then fuck you, innit? But if you've got medical terms and conditions,
yeah? Then you've got to back it fam, I'll back
it. What would you recommend for Nick Clegg? What would you think his preferred method
of cannabis ingestion would be? Who's Nick Clegg? He's the sideman. What would you recommend for Ed Miliband? Ed looks like he smokes weed already to be
honest. He has those very heavily lidded eyes, doesn't
he? He does. EVeryone vote Ed, he already gets high. Come on a zoot with us mate! If politics were a tree, what sort of tree
would it be? A big, fat, cannabis plant. It should just be one big fat cannabis plant. If Ed Miliband were a tree, what sort of tree
would he be? Yeah, word, a shit stick cuz, stick stick
innit, a shit stick. If David Cameron were a tree, what sort of
tree would he be? A prick. Well, we're in the eye of the storm here,
the epicentre of the green hurricane, and I have to admit to feeling a little bit
hazy. I'm not sure if it is all the marijuana, I
did take a few evening primrose oil tablets this morning, it might be that, but, it's now coming up to a quarter past 4 and, well, you could cut the tension with a hot
knife. A little booing going on and I think perhaps
someone has tried to rack up a line of coke. He's racing. Is it just you lot? I'm a big guy, I'm a big guy/ It's a bull running through here. Big Narstie appears to be racing people through
the park. This day has gone from marijuana straight
in to surrealism without any Pink Floyd in between. Right, we've just heard that it is 4/20 now
and I am about to be surrounded by hundreds of
law breakers, if not thousands. One's cheese and one's haze. Is this cheese? That's definitely haze. Come on, this is a real thing, we're wavy
right, cannabis is a good thing. Well the 4/20 protests are drawing to their
natural stoned conclusion just behind me with the police mopping up. It's been a very fun day. It would be easy to mock these sorts of things, with their Cartman bongs and hemp leggings,
but, you know, with 3 of the 5 major parties now in favour
of some kind of marijuana legalisation it does seem that the green tide is turning
in our new multi-party system."
4wmEQhRPSxU,Medical Marijuana: Research &amp; Therapeutic Potential,2015-10-01T19:50:24Z,"I'm gonna start by recalling back as a junior high kid when this was late 50s when it was all the rage to be hearing about the discovery of the double helix DNA and coding for protein synthesis from these intertwining strands of DNA this was the biggest thing in biology that had happened probably ever in my in at least in my brief life at that time here we are 45 years later and and I have to say that the endocannabinoid system is second to none as far as discoveries in biology and science that have come forward since that time there's nothing that even comes close understanding cannabinoids and the endocannabinoid system is so unique and so powerful and so underutilized in medicine that I think it's absolutely criminal really that we're holding back on the use of cannabis medicines so there are researchers at NIH and who have been publishing papers quite recently saying that modulating this endocannabinoid system basically can affect almost all disease and they list them and it's many many lines of diseases that are noted that are affected by the endocannabinoid system including cancers and so forth and so forth you know them and we the docs that are out here in the field doing this have actually realized this for decades or at least many years and so we're in the position of trying to see cannabis medicines really gain a stronger foothold by way of more research because we really need to be able to do clinical studies in order to know what is the best thing to advise I'm gonna not take too much more time at least at the moment here except to say I'm an MD I practice in Sebastopol California my practice is cannabis consultations I've been doing it with an office for 15 years and unofficially for about 35 years so I'm glad to be here thank you for the invitation hey Jean talleyrand also an MD and I guess a reluctant businessman I've been in business for 11 years started Medicaid at this point we've evaluated over 200,000 patients over the 11 years we mean a group of doctors who work for the company I guess the comment that I want to make is is to remark how few people are here and to remark on the discussion that happened prior in regard taxation I know this is not medical talk but I hear a lot of wow we finally made it and the endocannabinoid system was officially discovered in 88 92 right so I don't know if you know science science moves slowly and 92 is like yesterday so we've got so much to know about how cannabinoids work with the body or how the endocannabinoid system works itself with with the plant with the phyto cannabinoids or with acupuncture this is a new system and it's not about weed anymore it's about us it's about how well we can get understanding the system and so that's really as they're considering legalization and being able to use this planet all the time are they understanding or our legislators so if you can grab them and say well what about the endocannabinoid system how is that going to be reflected in your new laws that's really what I'm curious about my name is Tracey Ryan I am the CEO of a nonprofit collective called canna kids I originally got into the industry when my baby was diagnosed with an optic pathway glioma brain tumor I was forced into the cannabis industry it wasn't something that I even really knew that was happening or emerging behind the scenes this was a time when children weren't being talked about when it came to their diagnosis and when somebody first offered cannabis as an option for my then tiny little baby I told him I thought they were absolutely crazy and how in the world would I get my baby stoned when that's what I used to do in college for fun I am NOT an MD I do consider myself a mom kala just now after two and a half years of going through this industry and chemotherapy sessions and working hand in hand with now hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of other families and through a chain of events I was blessed to be put in touch with some incredible people that knew a lot about the medicine in the industry and zelda's is here today was originally brought to us through Ricki Lake and ABI Epstein who we're doing a documentary on how cannabis kills cancer and pediatrics and through Ricci through and Zelda's and through dr. Jeffrey rabe our and a lot of other doctors and scientists and incredible minds in the industry my education began my husband and I are continuing to treat our child who has now been considered a medical miracle she was supposed to be completely blind in her left eye the right eye was supposed to be grossly compromised and I'm here to tell you she has perfect vision her tumor was she has the kind of brain tumor that isn't supposed to shrink with chemotherapy it's supposed to arrest the development and if you see minimal shrinkage at best it's considered a huge success and if you do see shrinkage it's only for four to six months our daughter had 95% regression of her tumor has this completely disappeared and the doctors just couldn't explain it so the other the other cool fact about another little thing that happened with my daughter is that she suffered from nine blood transfusions and for months before she actually stopped chemotherapy she just stopped needing them which is not how the human body worked and not how there was anything that doctors could explain except for that you know what this must be the cannabis so after realizing that this is really a medicine and this is something that really can help and cure and kill these diseases that's how can kids was born it started as a secret group on Facebook with now over 1,200 families that are all treating their children holistically using cannabinoid therapy and I recognized that there was a need in this industry for more people that had education and more voices that could speak loudly and I can speak loudly that is one thing I've been gifted with a gift of gab and and I just went on a mission and now we have several hundred patients that we treat we are getting stories that would make the hairs on your arms crawl kids tumors are shrinking when they're not supposed to children are sent into palliative care and they're given no chance to live in three months later their cancer is gone and the doctors cannot explain it we've got children who are celebrating thank you we've got children who are celebrating 30 and 45 days now completely seizure free since their very first dose of CBD and integrated in with some TCA in many cases we've got PTSD patients who are off their meds people who are taking handfuls of opiates that now just don't need them anymore because their pain is gone Crohn's patients who are gaining weight for the first time in their lives and people with severe anti-anxiety me being one of them being a cancer mom that's relieving these issues it is a medicine I'm here to tell you I witness it every day three phone calls just yesterday from parents saying my kids tumor is shrinking my child is going to live and I am you know first and foremost just honored to be up here with professionals that have been doing this way longer than I have and I'm very excited to be a part of this industry and I'm honored I feel blessed to have accidentally fell fallen into this it's it's been a blessing for us because we do now know why God made our child sick I had in part because I was very disturbed mr. Korea's legislation last year it was awful I sent him a letter telling it was awful and I got very little response you had this one gentleman sitting up here said well we want to check on driving well I don't know maybe they don't believe the Department of Transportation that says there's no increased risk from driving when you've used marijuana or maybe they don't believe the Food and Drug Administration that says about th see that's what marinol is or Tran a banal prescription medication that's was approved by the FDA in 1985 and that has the usual psychoactive drug warning warning don't drive operate heavy equipment or engage in dangerous activity until you determine whether or not this interferes with that activity pretty good advice I'm guessing that all the doctors up here and any doctors have out there give that advice you had the fella from Los Angeles who said gee maybe this stuff is useful in treating PTSD or attention deficit disorder well dr. Talleyrand has 200,000 clients I'm guessing that there's more than a couple that have been treated for attention deficit disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder and I know that dr. hergenrother and I have seen lots of patients but we don't have the same patient population that medicham does why couldn't the state legislature reschedule cannabis to schedule two like the Iowa State Board of Pharmacy rescheduled to schedule five what would be dummies here we don't understand that it does have a medical use what do they they don't have the courage to take on the federal government when the federal government is you know to monstre Blee wrong and and how about we've heard this thing about well gee people don't know enough we need to know more I'll tell you who needs to know more it's doctors do we teach it in our medical schools I know they teach it a little bit of UCL so I can't knock all of them but there was a study that came out recently that said 13% of medical schools teach about the endocannabinoid system whether any of those teach about the effect that cannabis has on the endocannabinoid system I don't know but for my money the endocannabinoid system is the largest neurotransmitter system in the human body and as dr. hergenrother said it's useful in treating an enormous array of of conditions and I have to admit my own slowness to learn I guess I'm a slow learner I probably heard about the medical value of cannabis before anybody else in this room and it's only because I'm older than most everybody else in this room but there was in 1959 my father who was a pharmacist and I were talking about alcohol prohibition and he told me he said you know in 1928 when I was a freshman at the University of Minnesota School of Pharmacy one of our assignments was to make tincture of cannabis and he said and we had to be very careful because the alcohol was illegal and I looked up in his Remington's 1927 textbook of pharmacy and there on page 999 and 1,000 it tells you how to make tincture of cannabis and that it's useful as an anodyne that's an archaic word for analgesic analgesia is the number one reasons why doctors recommend cannabis today and it also I think it had an archaic word for tranquilizer like call motive so there it was it must have taken me 15 or 20 years before I was able to shed myself of the propaganda it wasn't that I didn't feel that marijuana should be legalized it was that I didn't see how a plant could be a medicine it took me 15 years so I'm a little bit more patient when doctors don't get it in 15 minutes but I this is not 1959 anymore I mean we have 20,000 22,000 research studies on cannabis and cannabinoids that have been done in the last 20 years I mean if you have a doctor who doesn't understand even a little bit about cannabis then you need to get another doctor that doctor is not reading medical journals I'm not talking about reading high times I'm talking about reading medical journals by the way high times in 1975 had a cover article on the use of cannabis as medicine and I thought oh they're just pulling my leg and a couple of years later I thought oh no Dave you're just dumb again you know somebody else is ahead of the curve on this so the state legislature should mandate that the medical schools that you and I are paying good tax dollars for teach about the endocannabinoid system and you know we need to have regulations that protect people we need to treat this like a medicine it should be tested absolutely you got THC in this you got CBD in this you got CBG in this what terpenes do you have in this what's the dose that you're taking oh and you know it would be nice if the people read the label some of you may be familiar with marine Dowd who is a columnist for The New York Times went to Colorado and she had candy bar and she took a piece of that nothing happened because when you take something orally it takes 45 minutes to an hour 15 minutes so she took another piece of course nothing happened she waited another 15 minutes she ate the whole thing and she wrote this comic I was miserable for six hours well maybe if she had done some research you know and read up on it that would have been useful and I think that these things need to be labeled I got a whole bunch of other stuff I want to share with you but I think I'll leave a little air for the rest of the panel here oh there is you know even Time magazine you know comes out with the highly divisive curiously underfunded and strangely promising world of pot science and I do want to mention these guys want to see whether cannabis interferes with driving I have a hundred page response in a legal case that are put together with Paul R Montano Paul is the deputy director of normal knows more about driving under the influence of marijuana than anybody I get the big gigs because I have MD after my name not because I know something about this and we've got the information we've got the data there how about spending this money on seeing whether or not cannabis cures cancer thanks dr. Bierman just mentioned there were over 20,000 peer-reviewed studies in formal medical journals about the use of cannabis or cannabinoids and their efficacy against many conditions and I was wondering what several of you thought some of the most informative and influential articles were that showed how and why cannabinoids were benefit benefiting these diseases either studies specifically on those specific conditions or the endocannabinoid system as a whole because there's a lot of great ones out there I'd love to know what you think I start this is actually more of a patient doctor anecdotal study that United patients group posted recently that I found extremely intriguing and I have incorporated into our practice which is how THC and CBD works with different forms of breast cancer because there's estrogen positive progesterone positive her2 and we have found this to be true in our practice with our breast cancer patients as have the nurses that I've worked with and it was interesting to find that if you are estrogen positive or triple positive the THC can actually influence the growth of the cancer cells whereas if you do a higher CBD regiment you see the cancer just get annihilated and I found that very interesting because we all believe THC is a cancer killer and in every kind of disease outside of estrogen positive and triple positive it is we are our average ratio is a one to one or a two to one and in some cases even a three to four to one being THC the highest but I found this very intriguing which is you know one of the reasons why I think that the science the the trial was like these things have to be happening now and we have to get this off the schedule in order to really be able to study how the human body interacts with these different compounds once we introduce them into our body we've had some incredible success with breast cancer and and by following this anecdotal doctor driven patient driven type of regimen we're seeing it really work in these patients and I just I found that so interesting when you know looking at all of the other studies out there and and that was the one study that really kind of made us pivot a little bit on how we were treating these women individually I would like to it's actually it's if you go to United patients group.com they have it on there and we also have it on Ryland farms comm if you go under our cannabis studies it's on the first page we have summarized their article and put a link to the full article on there and it's it's been driven by anecdotal and doctor research I was wanted to make the comment that and I don't have the name of the author but there was a study come out of Israel in May and it was speaking about the difference between isolated CBD and CBD as a whole plant extract just quick show of hands who knows about this already okay about a quarter of you I'm gonna just briefly describe it when you take a single molecule CBD and look at the dose response it's a bell-shaped curve which is to say too little and it doesn't do a thing too much and it doesn't do a thing but just in the right sweet spot it does a lot so this is something unique in in CBD well it is unique but there are what I want to compare what they compared it to in the Israeli study is this they took a whole plant extract of a CBD rich medicine and it behaved as a linear curve so the more you gave the more effect you got this is what we have in the plant and so when you isolate these molecules and get out to these 99% CBD extracts that's not what you want you want the whole plant now I'm going to move quickly onto three papers that I think are valuable too for you to know about one of them is the Huestis paper maryland Huestis was published in 2007 on pharmacokinetics of cannabis and this is something that is a little out of date but it's the only thing we have right now and it talks about bioavailability and the blood levels and so forth of various forms of administration of of cannabis so what we're looking at is the differences between the metabolism of ingested forms oral buccal exposure rectal use of cannabinoids you know she goes through the whole list so it's the best information we have to date and I think it's something that you ought to have in your in your folder of cannabis information another one is called the keel study that came out of England it was published in about 2005 or six what they did in England this is about schizophrenia and psychosis and there's still a quiet a push by the federal government to make you feel that we're gonna cause a lot of schizophrenia and psychosis by letting cannabis be legalized this study went on to look at about two-and-a-half percent of the of the English population over a ten-year span in the clinic systems in Great Britain and over that span the 18 year olds or younger had an 18 fold increase in the use of cannabis and during that interval there was no increase in schizophrenia or psychosis it's an important study to be able to refer to and the third one I'm gonna mention for a moment here is in 2010 the paper by Marku and McAllister and others came out of San Francisco this is a very important study in order to look at the effects of CBD and THC on the growth of cancer cells and and what happens when you put these two molecules together which is known as synergism and it's quite remarkable because as they increase the doses of THC they began to see the cells either die off or not be able to grow both with THC at a certain level in the micro five micro molar range and in the one micromolar range when you give CBD similarly they had a drop in the in the survival of these cells when they put them together the cancer cells practically could not grow at all so very important when you're dealing with cancers get the kit get the cannabinoids balance more or less exactly what balance we don't know we would love to know and we'd love to be able to look at some some clinical trials where we could tease this apart more I take it off from taking off from what Jeff had to say when I saw Justin's questions my response was we don't know the federal government has systematically blocked research yet they deny it as a matter of fact I recently wrote an op-ed piece that was published in The Seattle Times and they denied it there their response was oh we proof a research for THC and CBD just heard dr. hergenrother say we're not talking about isolated extract we're talking about the whole plant dr. Donna tashkin is an emeritus professor of pulmonology at UCLA there was an old study did in 1975 that said cannabis is a bronchodilator and this is why in the 1920s you had at least three cigarettes on the market that were contained cannabis they were for the treatment of asthma because it's like advair it's a bronchodilator it's an anti-inflammatory kashkin is more famous an article that you definitely should have was his study in Los Angeles where he took a look at the los Los Angeles County cat cancer research directory or blog and I had 1,100 patients match them up with 1,100 people of similar age sex in geographic area and he thought that he was going to find that the more marijuana you smoked the more likely you were to get lung cancer and he's a very straight shooter and what he found was the more marijuana you smoked the less likely you were to get lung cancer I mean then this guy was a straight shooter he is a great deal of respect for me two more quick ones one is not a scientific study it's a clinical study and it was done by dr. Herc and Wrather on Crohn's disease and his very extensive questionnaire and it showed that people with Crohn's disease who were using cannabis this is you know sort of a skewed study of poor treating their Crohn's disease had less abdominal pain fewer stools better form stools and many of them were able to stop using steroids which not a good thing to use on a daily basis unless maybe they have Crohn's disease and then two more quick ones one is a article that appeared in the Scientific American in 2004 by Elder and nickel entitled the brain zone marijuana and it talks about retrograde inhibition which i think is very important in understanding the role of cannabis in terms of the dealy with the migraines or seizures and attention deficit disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder and then lastly there was a review article in 2008 out of the University of Wisconsin that touched on about 12 or 15 different cancers in which numerous studies by on that cannabis killed cancer cells in tissue culture and in mice one more article if you're writing it down the care and feeding of the endocannabinoid system highly recommended it's a review article and it brings to light that this is not about the plant it's about the endocannabinoid system excellent and yes that article that um doctor talleyrand just mentioned talks about all these other things that you can do to enhance your endocannabinoid system like acupuncture probiotics omega-3s so there's many things that you can do besides using cannabis in order to strengthen your endocannabinoid system and make the cannabis that you do use a lot more effective and I didn't want to throw in one more study that's really great it's called the endocannabinoid system as an emerging target of pharmaco therapy which was published in 2006 it literally goes through hell endocannabinoid system plays a role in every single major disease so you know any any relationship it's pretty incredible the endocannabinoid system as an emerging target of pharmacotherapy by patcher ba Chi and ku knows it's a great article so although we you know there we do need a lot more research especially to make good recommendations to patients about what to use but you know in the current environment what can you do to make good recommendations to patients and what are the most important factors in making those recommendations what the what the most important factors are in recommending Academies protocol for someone and how you go about making your recommendations about what they should use and do well for us I'm not a doctor I didn't go to medical school I don't understand drug interactions like these professionals do so we have a team of nurses and doctors that were training currently that can really look at what is the disease what are they doing from a Western medicine type of standpoint how old are they how much do they weigh and how do we need to treat this patient based on their specific disease one of the most frustrating things for me is this a gram a day it's just not how you should be treating yourself when you have a serious disease a gram of what no two oils are the same one could be 40% in strength one could be 75 to 85% in strength so telling a patient go take a gram a day that'll fix your cancer it's it's not how it should be done we're more advanced than that now the other thing that kind of frustrates me is still a little bit is this grain of rice theory the 1/2 of grain arise the grain arise well it did a half a grain of rice to you isn't a half a grain of rice to me yeah it is that long grain is it a short grain is it you know what what size is a screen so you know what we have done is we've really taken a step back and said ok how do we treat these patients consistently across the board especially because we deal so heavily in pediatrics the last thing you want to do is send a child into you know anxiety at or make them uncomfortable or any in any way or make them feel worse than they already feel so we start our patients out with tinctures and we look at how many cannabinoids per milliliter are in that tincture and we start them off on a small dose as small as five milligrams and using a tincture we can accurately weigh out using a 1 gram syringe that exact dose every single time and then we slowly increase them every 3 to 5 days now this is all specific to that disease we don't treat an autistic child the same way as we do an epileptic child or the same way do it we do is a cancer child or an adult with cancer or Crohn's or PTSD all of these different types disease have different things that anecdotally because we're not allowed to do a lot of this research have found to be the most effective so it's about working with a professional that understands exactly what pharmaceuticals are being ingested into the body how those interact with the liver enzymes and the body as a whole and what kind of like epilepsy for example a lot of these look on feeding horrible drugs that they put these children on can can block the cannabis and can interact with the cannabis in a very negative way so for an epilepsy patient it really is quite important to have their physician on board so that you can start to decrease the use of those pharmaceuticals while you're increasing in the use of cannabis in order to make it actually work otherwise the kids just going to continue to cease and then also understanding the power of bringing in something like THC a which is an incredible medicine that we're doing more and more research on in more and more studies on when it comes to our epileptic children we're finding that in many cases the CBD does a fantastic job of decreasing the seizures but it's not completely getting rid of them you add in a little bit of THC a our kids are seizure free we've got three of them right now celebrating 30 45 55 days without a single seizure after having seizures every hour on the hour and some hundreds a day so it's really understanding each of the diseases you know when you have a GBM for example if it's been completely resected and there's no tumors still there then the protocol could definitely be different than someone that still has a mass the cancer still there and active it requires a higher THC verses when there's no tumor or present a lot it's a lot of circumstances a higher CBD with children like my little girl Sophie who has an optic pathway glioma we have so far seen a hundred percent success rate in getting these tumors that don't traditionally shrink to shrink using a protocol of a one to one and in some cases a two to one and we're starting them around the 350 milligrams of total cannabinoids a day monitoring the scans seeing if it works and keeping them there at the lower dose versus the 500 600 700 milligrams a day for a small child because why give them more medicine if they don't actually need it the challenge that we have with cancer is that these kids aren't getting scans every few weeks they're getting scans every two and a half months so we're really having to stick with a protocol for a certain amount of time seeing how it works adjust and then continue the treatment but understanding the science of it and what their oncologists are doing or their neurosurgeons are doing or neurologists are doing is very very important when also introducing cannabinoid therapy into the body we adjust doses depending on her patients so even with blood pressure medicine you're gonna give start at a dose and then you're gonna adjust it over time and one person might react well to 10 milligrams of lisinopril and one person might not react well at all so there's still variability from person to person but the dosing how do we dose in medicine it's very simple milligrams per kilogram of body weight so milligrams of what are you using THC CBD beta Kari awfully what are you using what's in the plant that using have your medicine analyzed then you'll know how many milligrams you're taking on a regular basis and how what's your body weight because a big person may metabolize differently than a smaller person especially important in the kids so really simple things I understand variability from person to person and we're I'm standardized with milligrams per kilogram I would add to that to say that somewhere in this range of a half a milligram per kilogram per day is a decent starting point for many situations and I would also add that tailoring the dose for any individual is is what it's all about and when I hear Justin's question I'm kind of thinking how much time do we have this is what I do initially certainly at the first visit and follow-up visits as well because it's an awful lot of it is about figuring out what's going on with this person and how they need to best utilize the medicine so for example if it's an adult who's picking up the grandkids at 3 o'clock at school that's going to play into the treatment plan as far as what kind of shape they're going to be in after it after their dosing so many times we're going to dose a higher dose at bedtime for serious medical conditions often we're going to try to get two or three doses in per day this is orally I'm speaking of because of the fact that orally ingested cannabinoid oils or tinctures of any kind or products of any kind have a metabolism over the course of about 5 to 10 hours generally and we do have genetic variations not only in our genome to code for this cytochrome p450 metabolic pathway not everybody is the same and in many people it's quite different so we really have to look at an individual's response in order to know what kind of a dose they can tolerate another factor that was kind of alluded to was drug drug interactions and this is a big deal but not a big deal it's a big deal because well it's not a big deal because over the use of sativex coming out of Great Britain a one to one ratio of THC and CBD roughly a couple milligrams of each in an oral spray they have then had these patients using the sativex sprayed orally 510 times a day is more or less what they're using it in 30,000 patient years and dr. Russo who is the medical director there said it's probably more like 40,000 patient years of experience there have been no discontinuation of drugs of the canoe of the Sativex because of a drug drug interaction that is to say even though some some pharmaceuticals such as anticonvulsants a couple different anticonvulsants are metabolized but the same metabolic pathway as the THC and CBD it's not a worry because probably the dose of cannabinoids is small enough to where it does not have a significant impact in altering the blood levels of these anticonvulsants now on the other hand a kid that might be on anticonvulsants that's the kid who you really have to be careful with because a you could run into a drug drug interaction and and the the quantity of or the concentration of the the anticonvulsant may change significantly if they're on a very high dose of cannabis oils such as in a cancer therapy which in a kid with brain tumor they may very well be on an anticonvulsant as well but excepting that it just generally isn't a problem I think they go back to the question that I asked in one of the previous panels is we need to treat cannabis like a medicine and that's what doctor telling around and dr. hergenrother said there is an individual adjustment that you make with most patients on most medicines so why should it be any different for for cannabis i also need to admit my ignorance here's a wheel that shows CBD CBN CDC I really don't have a clue as to what the appropriate amount percentages of them that's why we need to have more research now GW Pharmaceuticals is doing some of that research but that's just the tip of the iceberg know what I have used in terms of determining dose is dronabinol which is THC I mentioned that before and what I found is is that relatively low doses of THC like 2 and 1/2 milligrams one two three times a day is good for most people who have attention deficit disorder who have anxiety five to ten milligrams of THC is good for helping people sleep I had treated a woman who had multiple sclerosis and then she fell and tripped and fractured her shoulder and she said doctor ten milligrams didn't do anything but when I went to fifteen milligrams it got rid of the pain so then I started prescribing fifteen to twenty milligrams and what I found was I got a lot of complaints about the side-effects about dysphoria and you need to be careful of that and that's that's why the whole plant as was mentioned earlier is is is so important I had a patient that came in about two three weeks ago and he had maybe had pain and so they took an edible and I said now trying to get a one-to-one THC CBD so they did and I get a call and said the guy hallucinate it how much it he came 30 milligrams and and then I said listen to yourself Dave is CBD partially blocks the euphoria caused by THC and I don't know what that partially blocks means but let's say for a minute that it blocks 30% of the euphoria so this guy had the equivalent of 20 milligrams of THC I can understand why for some people it would be unpleasant and caused dysphoria so you know you need to take a look at the side-effect profile you need to take a look at prescription drugs in which there are recommended doses and they've tested a ton animals and people and you need to listen to your patients I mean everybody's different and I've learned more from my patients and I can possibly thank them for I wanted to recognize that what Tracy Ryan had said a minute ago regarding not oil not all oils are the same this is something that you I become very aware of in in consulting with people by phone across the country for example a fellow said gee I took the oil and you know increased the dose and I'm still not feeling it and so they finally on advice when I hadn't had it analyzed and the amount of cannabinoids in the oil was something around 12% that's not what we get out here generally speaking so when you get these oils that are 30 to 85% cannabinoids you've got something much more potent another element of this is how much CBD is in there and the more CBD it really offsets the psychoactivity significantly and one of my patients brought back to me some follow up about treating cancer and poorly treated myeloma multiple myeloma patient and I sent him home in recommending that he up you know increases dose gradually over the course of a few weeks and when he came back he said well I got home and said phooey and he took the whole gram of oil just at one time and was pretty pretty knocked out and he and his wife kind of chuckled and he said yeah you're kind of a lump on the couch for five days he continued to take the gram of oil a day by the way he was determined so he kept taking it on the fifth day he got up and started acting normally again the point is tolerance is our friend in this situation it really develops rapidly when we use high doses of cannabinoids and it may not be five days for everybody but generally over that course of about a week you see a great deal of tolerance developed and people should you know be cautioned about a variety of things including a fall risk and it's going to maybe affect their blood pressure and so so forth when they're using high doses of oil but eventually they're going to become tolerant of it and be able to take high doses which may be necessary in some conditions particularly some really difficult tumors my concern Jeff is down-regulating the system the endocannabinoid says if you take too much like Rik Simpson oil procedure maybe you're doing harm because your system so what's the sweet spot yeah and I agree with that completely because I've got patients that come to me and they're like we're on 2,000 milligrams like are you crazy why would you ever take 2,000 milligrams but some of these kids have diseases like DIPG which is in the brain stem where there's hardly any receptors at all and with cannabis we're not seeing shrinkage in the brain stem we're seeing stabilization so they're thinking if I just keep giving more and more and more maybe at some point I'm gonna start to see some shrinkage but there are just some situations and this is one an individualized situation where we're seeing stabilization and not you know apoptosis or or cell death so it's really about finding that sweet spot and and you know like dr. Bierman said listening to your patients or listening to your body if it's if you are the patient and working up slowly we usually advise our patients to go up and dose every 3 to 5 days when once that psycho activity starts to kind of mitigate itself so that they can build that tolerance easily and the the masks enjoy it's a ninety ninety seven ninety eight percent of our kids get to a point where they don't feel it at all anymore my child is gonna be three next weekend and you would never know that she on cannabis at all she is wild so which is a great thing considering she's on chemotherapy like she's a normal happy healthy functioning chubby little baby and and she loves life and she's kicking the shit out of cancer pardon my french my question is I guess the not sure what the proper word is cannabis potentiating the effects of chemo possibly and sort of how that works if maybe asking your doctors for a trial dose or I get fully aware cannabis helps throughout through chemo but are there instances where maybe cannabis allows the chemo to work more I guess that's my question absolutely yeah there is a synergistic effect I told Tim as Olamide one of the answer drugs and cannabinoids that's been seen in a study that's out there it's not uncommon for glioblastoma and others exactly what I'm talking conditions where over a course of a few months that the effect of temozolomide is wanes so it looks like it's helpful initially and then it disappears if cannabinoids are brought in at least in this study that it was published not too long ago temozolomide seem to regain its edge as the cannabinoids were added so there is a synergism with with the cannabinoids and the and the chemotherapy as far as the chemotherapy in general I don't think there's much question that the docs out there even the sqaure Doc's that have never done this before are recognizing that here the cannabis patients are coming in and they've gained weight during chemotherapy and they're feeling great and in many cases it really mitigates the symptoms significantly my daughter is on Temodar right now so she's on timid or anything Christine and carboplatin and again this is where I always go back to these optic pathway gliomas and this is one of the reasons why I want to do everything in my power to raise money to do a trial that's that's privately funded on these specific humours because these are tumors that the doctors told us this is not going to shrink your kid's gonna go blind chemos not gonna make it smaller it's gonna arrest the development of it if we see a little bit of shrinkage it'll be considered a huge success ninety-five percent shrinkage you yes the chemo is working with the cannabis in this situation and all of her doctors are now again doctors who had no idea that cannabis was even in the medical books or even been talked about they had no research on it whatsoever like dr. Pierre mom was saying before they know now and now all of these other children that have these low-grade gliomas that don't traditionally work with chemotherapy these tumors are shrinking like crazy I've got one dad who contacted me yesterday another scan same same type of tumor OPG tumor is shrinking even more the radiologist actually called the oncologist and said what new clinical trial do you have this little girl on where you're getting her tumor to shrink this much and the doctors like she's she's on vincristine and carboplatin and the radiologist like I can't explain this I can't understand how it continues to keep shrinking month after month after month so absolutely it absolutely anticip and makes the chemo work harder and stronger and penetrates the cell deeper to cause more cell death I've got a story to share with you it's at a cocktail party in February and this fellow's like twenties early thirties said my stepfather has cancer the throat metastasized to the regional lymph node the rib and the liver and the doctors say she could've died what do you know about Simpson oil I don't know too much about sensitive doctor hergenrother really knows about that but I told him what little I knew and didn't think much of it and early june he calls me up and said last cat scan showed my stepfather is cured and he came into my office a couple weeks later and they couldn't find anything I did another cat scan I found a little bit of cancer at the base of his tongue or they did give him chemo along with the this and so now they're going to give him chemo but not for palliation they're gonna give him treatment for cure and so I the problem goes back to what I think all of us have touched on is you need to have some research to really answer question on the other hand dr. Abrams has nailed it when he said there's more than enough basic science evidence and anecdotal reports to justify doing double-blind studies and everybody in this room should break the white house and say when are you going to start the double-blind studies that are federally funded for the treatment of cancer they are our blood that was actually happening so you and you address that treated down I mean I was like I tell you yes the only known injection I am aware of is Manuel Guzman infusing TAC and two into the GBM brain tumors in in Madrid and otherwise I am not aware of anybody injecting cannabis oil into tumors breast cancer dr. McAllister up in San Francisco is doing a double-blind study with cannabis for treatment of breast cancer and I think all of us up here are aware of breast cancer patients whose cancer is either gone into remission or be cured depending upon you know what terminology you want to use from oral ingestion I it's speculative as to whether injecting it would be worthwhile but it's certainly something that we worth doing research on what McAlister previously did a study on mice and I think they injected the material whatever their subject material was I don't know if it was from cannabis or THC or CBD into the peritoneal cavity and it cured the mouse's breast cancer they didn't inject it into the tumor they injected it into the mouse so we know that your we can cure your mouse's breast cancer positions to accepting that if medical marijuana is a fact of life and whether you think that does perhaps one cause is this persistent belief that is either a gateway drug to addiction or addictive itself and also the prevalence of addiction programs and therapists who combined with all the opiates and alcohol addiction in all of those and what the solution is whether that is an obstacle to greater acceptance of it I think that's a biggest part of it would be education the other part of it is to stop the federal government wasting money on vilifying and misleading the public about what's going on that's ONDCP that's FDA that's NIH that's a night NIDA and FDA are all involved the FDA probably the least but they're all involved in in the misinformation that continues to come out in order to protect the vested interests I see that among my colleagues but I'm also the demographic of all of this is changing those Doc's that never refer to patient before and I hadn't heard from him for 20 years are now sending patients over a local oncologist who had never seen a result with cannabis saw GBM disappeared so things are happening and they're you know we're at the stage with some of these Doc's and it's really nice to be able to see this but as long as the feds are vilifying it the majority of doctors are not going to feel comfortable getting involved in this we do have to work on both the education medical school side of it we can't legislate medical schools teaching cannabinoid medicine we that's what I'm told by the legislators in my question today so we have to put pressure on every medical school in the in the land that's been my experience with the doctors that I've worked with and that our patients have been with is that you know you go in initially and they have no idea what you're talking about and then they see something miraculous happened and they start to go hmm you know what maybe maybe there is something to this and my daughter's been treated at Kaiser sunset she's now at Sea HOA we've collaborated with doctors at choc hospital and none of these people really understood what was going on with her in her case and many of her other kids cases that are also treated these the same hospitals but they started to see this this spontaneous regression if you will in a tumor that clearly wasn't spontaneous spontaneously regressing and more and more oncologists now are sending of patients we're working with five major hospitals right now holistic doctors acupuncturist they're they're seeing the miracles and they cannot they can't deny it we had a boy 16 years old with relapsed osteosarcoma at 22 tumors in his bones came in in a neck brace he was on percocet oxycontin and vicodin every day just to get out of bed and they had him on a palliative chemo only to help with pain I'm here to tell you within two weeks on our cannabis oil he was completely pharmaceutical free and within 90 days he was cancer-free and that doctor has now said that doctor has now said I'm a believer I want to start sending you patients and if AJ is still cancer-free in the next two months when he gets his next next scan I'm gonna work with dr. Ronnie Goldstein and we're gonna publish this to medical journals so what's happening yeah I think that you're you're going to see as we have younger doctors who at least familiar with the REC where is the use of cannabis our greater willingness to read about this and to accept what they read I had a orthopedic surgeon write me a letter and I the papers in Santa Barbara the weekly is very liberal and the daily is a libertarian thing and so they both love what I write he said why don't you talk about the side effects of marijuana in your op-ed pieces I said because there's only 800 words that they allow me but if you think I don't know anything about it I sent him a chapter from my book oh he also carbon copied the paper because he thought he was being so clever an i carbon copy to pay for too because I knew I was being clever and they didn't publish his is his letter I think the more you have doctors like like dr. Herman rather and myself who are willing to speak out and stick our necks out you begin to have people in the community who know us and say well they're not nuts on other things maybe they really know what they're talking about you know and and you begin to see these changes but you know I mean it takes years and years one of the other things I noticed in Santa Barbara is that there have been two or three presentations at the local hospital one two of them by a couple of residents and the other by the doctor whose second in charge of continuing education and that's what you need to do I mean we are getting to have more certification for category 1 CME and I think one of the most effective things we're getting doctors to recognize this is what Tracy has talked about is the patient telling the doctor this stuff works this stuff works and I should mention there's there's a online program that Deborah Malka worked on and I provided a little assistance through the what's it called cannabis institute of medicine and it's it's 12-1 our continuing CNE things or you can give your doctor a present of my book"
MY2qv_UNvLA,Cannabis Laws in Australia 2015 (NCPIC),2015-05-05T04:48:22Z,hi I'm max and this is sy and today we're going to look at the issue of cannabis in the law and how that applies T so the laws relating to cannabis apply differently in different states and territories but it it's just important to know that in Australia it illegal to use cannabis ok well that's true isn't it decriminalized in the Northern Territory the acct in South Australia yes it is I think a lot of people get confused when you say decriminalized it doesn't mean that it's legal it just means that if you're caught with a certain amount of cannabis then you can be given a civil penalty as opposed to a criminal penalty so that's just something like a speeding ticket or a parking phone exactly so you're not going to like get a criminal conviction or go to jail unless you're caught more than one sure but what about the other states that where it is indeed from your list so that's where it really comes down to the discretion of the police officer so when they find you with carrying like a small amount cannabis or something then they can decide whether they want to give you a caution or send you to a rehabilitation program it just depends on the police officer at the time sure so it's pretty cool that you can get a second chance then if you get caught in those days pretty much but it depends so I think we might go for like the street three-strike policy so if you're caught with it more than the third time then you know you can get a criminal conviction for it what does that mean for me though if I get a criminal conviction for weed you're pretty much like it can have all sorts of effects like if you want to travel in the future once you turn 18 or something then you know they can refuse to give you like a travel visa or you know some jobs don't allow you to you know you won't even get past the application process if you have criminal conviction sure so whilst there's all of those different penalties and things in different states it's important to remember I suppose that it is just illegal across Australia and that those criminal convictions can have a pretty significant impact even if it doesn't seem like it at the moment definitely so if you want any more information or any of our fact sheets then please visit the NCP ACLJ you website or you can call our helpline on 1800 30 40 50 if you've got any questions that we haven't answered feel free to send us an email from the website or leave a comment below thank you
dG35RzWj1FA,Study: Cannabis extract sucessful in fighting epilepsy,2015-04-14T20:30:30Z,a study out today found a new treatment for epilepsy is showing great promise it uses an extract of marijuana here's dr. Jon LaPook school from age one Hank Kovach suffered from severe epilepsy that could not be controlled with medicine his mother Megan says in one day he could have more than 25 seizures I thought he was playing in the other room he was not playing in the other room he was convulsing turning blue and that's when I thought I lost him it's been such a good boy getting him all hooked up last summer she eagerly enrolled her son in a small trial designed to see if medical marijuana could help twice a day Hank receives a marijuana liquid extract called epid I elects the medicine does not contain THC the ingredient that can cause euphoria anxiety and paranoia Megan says the change has been dramatic we instantly saw results he was smiling again we noticed the decrease in seizures he was able to transition and at this point he was finally able to gain cognitive skills 137 children and young adults average age 11 were given the drug after 12 weeks parents reported the number of seizures declined forty-five to fifty percent dr. Linda locks of lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago is one of the researchers some of the kids clearly became more verbal better coordination I had one child who started walking while they were using the medications where's Harold the helicopter Hanks epilepsy was so severe at age seven he still cannot speak but he's able to attend school and has not had a seizure in months my goal for him is to hear his voice to hear him talk we just want him to be happy it's been known since the early 70s that the active ingredient Hank received called cannabidiol can block seizures and animals but how it works is unclear what is clear Scott that much more research is needed especially placebo-controlled trials promising news John thanks for that

NYSkHoFq_Q0,Can Cannabis help treat cancer?,2015-06-10T22:24:53Z,[Music] [Music] [Applause] medical cannabis bike taught is a nonprofit organization it's an annual cycle ride that raises money for independent research into medical cannabis specifically cannabis as a cancer cure I discovered the medical cannabis bike tour a couple of years ago when I was writing an article I contacted them to try and get an interview with some riders and they invited me along on the tour is upon the tier two weeks later I was in southern Spain running around helping out and two years later I'm still helping out [Music] our studies import the analysis on the of the anti-cancer action of cannabinoids and mainly in animal models of cancer and we are trying to understand how kilometers are working in cancer cells what are the molecular basis of the anti-cancer activity of cannabinoids we are trying to to translate these studies in animals and cellular models into the clinics have been studying the effect of kilometres and the current selection of cannabinoids in the US have been to mosun market in cancer in breast cancer about a cell carcinoma melanoma different types of cancer in which carriers have shown to have anti-cancer activity illicit animals I'm going to be the principal investigator and coordinator of this interesting study that is going to be sponsored by you know the Spanish group of studies in neuron ecology and we as a new group are very interested in developing this kind of studies so this first trial with the combination of THC and CBD is going to prompt other studies that that corroborate the evidence that cannabinoids are very useful for our patient that have no other corrective treatment the impact of this clinical trial in the medical community is going to be huge because this is going to be an independent clinical trial we are not meeting the industry pharmacy for certain pharmaceutical industries to develop it that could be a new area the objective of the study is to find the optimal dose of the cannabinoids in combination with the masala mite and radiotherapy so we don't know yet the optimal dose we are going to start with the minimum new models of THC and CBD and we are going to increase every week the dose in a very patient until we the clinicians find any toxicity we are going to show everybody that with other people that support us make very good science independently of economical interests [Music] both my parents died of cancer and traditional treatments didn't help them what attracted me to the medical cannabis bike tour is the fact that all the money raised goes directly to fund independent medical research it signs the profits and not big business can cannabis cure cancer there are many stories out there to suggest that it has the potential but without the scientific evidence they are just stories sometimes you have to think out the box that's what the medical cannabis bike tour is all about it's about changing perceptions it's also about people coming together and driving change the medical cannabis bike tour is a great adventure if you donate you will be part of that adventure and together hopefully we are going to make a little piece of medical history thanks for listening and thanks from the bike tour [Music]

NQLpu3BQTIM,Justin Kander: Cannabis Extracts For Treating Cáncer - #CannaCosta2015,2015-10-26T17:52:40Z,"we're going to start with the next presentation with a presenter a speaker who completed one of the most important's on medicinal cannabis comprehensive report on the cannabis tract movement 200 pages that analyze the growing evidence supporting cannabis extracts as medicinal products we have Justin Kendra with the minister all aspects of cannabis since 2008 I have been an advocate for the use of cannabis extracts to treat multitude of diseases but with a focus on cancer I've spoken with hundreds of patients and caregivers over the past several years who have seen direct anti-cancer effects using cannabis so not just for the palliative relief from chemotherapy but direct effects one cancer so I'm going to share more information with you and I hope you learn a lot so yesterday dr. Christina Sanchez did a wonderful job talking about some of the preclinical scientific evidence in cells and animals I'm going to touch on that a little bit but I'm mainly going to focus on the human evidence and documentation from individuals doctors and caregivers and what they're seeing through the use of this medicine so first just to reiterate how cannabis fights cancer in the preclinical studies it has been found that the major cannabinoids especially THC and CBD can inhibit cancers through a wide variety of mechanisms the most potent of these mechanisms is apoptosis or programmed cell death this is the direct killing of the cancer cell but it goes further than that they inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells they stop the formation of blood vessels to tumors which is a critical step in in tumor development and they stop the spread of cancer to other parts of the body these effects are mediated by both cannabinoid receptors non cannabinoid receptors and receptor independent effects so it's very varied so I'm not going to go too deep into this but I just want to show that it's not just in brain and breast cancer that cannabinoids are effective against the preclinical evidence has shown that THC can directly kill some of the most common and aggressive forms of cancer furthermore CBD is also shown to induce apoptosis in many cancers some of the pathways are similar to THC but there's a lot of unique things about THC and CBD and their best use together and it's not just THC and CBD that have anti-cancer potential the other major cannabinoids in cannabis including cannabic Jarrell cannabic Romijn and cannabinoid Aron have all been shown to kill cancer cells and even the raw aesthetic cannabinoids so before you heat cannabis in the plant they're the acidic the acidic forms and even these forms before you heat them have anti-cancer activity in a wide range of cancers so it's just pretty remarkable how they're all effective against so many cancers of course there's so many things that kill and inhibit cancers and preclinical models that don't transfer to humans but what really separates cannabis apart is that our own endocannabinoids that we make also kill and inhibit cancer cells through very similar mechanisms as phyto cannabinoids so all of us already have cannabinoids in our bodies helping to restrict cancer proliferation so these are just a few studies showing how an and amide one of our chief endocannabinoids inhibits cancer and that's where most of the research has been but other cannabinoids have some anti-cancer activity as well so this is being taken very seriously at the highest levels the United States Food and Drug Administration last September granted orphan drug designation status to a pharmaceutical CBD product for the direct treatment of glioma one of the most aggressive brain tumors and so orphan drug designation is given to new drugs that are intended to treat diseases affecting 200,000 people or less so it's it's easier to get OD d than the full-fledged conventional FDA approval but there still needs to be legitimate scientific evidence that would work in humans so the fact that the FDA did approve this use is a testament to how seriously that are taking the ability of cannabis to directly fight cancer and then also GW Pharmaceuticals which is one of the largest or the largest cannabis corporation in the world they produce Sativex which is approved in over 20 countries I believe 26 to treat spasticity associated with MS and it's basically the most widely used legal cannabis product and they've invested millions into research in the cannabis and cancer as well as a patent on the use of varying ratios of THC and CBD to directly fight glioma so they're investing these resources because they know how real the potential is and they know what's going on behind the scenes so what really matters are the human results is this really working in humans yesterday we heard from Stephanie LaRue who had an amazing experience beating her third recurrence of breast cancer with only cannabis oil and she is by far not the only person who have seen these results so the first person I want to talk about is Stan Rutner I got to meet him last November at the United patients group conference in California his son-in-law and daughter started United patients group after his successful healing experience and he's inspired hundreds to thousands of people to use a similar protocol so he was diagnosed with lung cancer in early 2011 and it had metastasized to his brain he did attempt to use conventional treatment but at that stage it just wasn't it wasn't enough so he was sent home one hospice with just weeks to live he began as a last resort cannabis infused coconut oil it's very good to combine cannabis with coconut oil because cannabinoids are fat soluble and coconut oil or and any fat but coconut oil especially seems to be a very effective carrier for the cannabinoids so he began using these cannabis infused coconut capsules and added a higher he improved dramatically with just these very low doses he was able to get off supplemental oxygen than a couple weeks and just began feeling a lot better so this inspired him to use slightly higher doses of THC rich oil which was still much lower he was still I believe less than a hundred milligrams of THC but that was enough for him and by January 2013 he was cancer-free and remains cancer-free to this day so it's an incredible experience and he's great next is Cory Allen she is an amazing activist who I've known for several years now she was diagnosed with anal canal cancer in July 2011 and slightly before that she'll also been diagnosed with to skin cancer spots on her collarbone so radiation was proposed she had surgery that a limb that took out a lot of the of the anal canal cancer that was outside but there was still a lot inside that they were going to need to radiate and I don't really want to get into it but I'm sure you can imagine some of the side effects that can come from radiating that area and she just didn't want to deal with it so she made the decision to look for another option and learned about cannabis oil so she began using it as a treatment for both the cancer she's had and skin cancer is one of the the easiest things to see results wet she just you know used it topically and in just over yep just over a week had eliminated the two spots of skin cancer and then she began both orally ingesting cannabis oil and mixing it with olive oil in capsules and using it to suppositories which has shown especially effective against colorectal cancer prostate cancer and anal canal cancer where the you know the cancer is in that region and by May 2012 she had a basic exam where they couldn't find the cancer and then a more detailed exam in September found that she was cancer-free and she had been given 2 to 6 months to live if she had denied the radiation so she was terminal and beat the cancer and this is a cool picture of her with dr. McCollum you you saw clips from him in the Sun and the scientist yesterday from Zack Kline so it goes all the way to the top next we have Joanne Crowther who's another great activist who also lives in Canada she had been diagnosed with Flynn FOMA that had metastasized to her brain in summer 2009 and ended in a this first experience she eliminated it only with chemotherapy and radiation jihad I believe didn't even use cannabis for palliative relief and she was well for a while but the cancer eventually returned both in the lymphoma and in parts of her brain and other parts of the body so again she attempted chemo it had worked for before but it caused problems with her liver she was using two different drugs and they caused problems with both her liver and kidneys and she was forced to stop and go in Hospice because she just couldn't tolerate the chemotherapy anymore so she began using cannabis oil again as a last resort and in just a couple months she had a primary lymphoma mass in her left thigh that regressed very quickly and then by September she was in complete remission and like Stan she is still and Cory's they are still in remission today and one of the first guys who was who produced the documentary showing documentation of anti-cancer activity was David Triplett who had skin cancer that he was diagnosed with in March 2010 and he was given a chemotherapy cream that he looked up the side effects for and sold you know there were a ton of potential bad side effects so he he's known about cannabis oil and decided to try that first so he actually had you know documented evidence with the photos putting it on it basically pulls the cancer out and his clean so he had an amazing experience and it inspired a lot of people with skin cancer and this guy Brian Stewart he's particularly interesting he's actually in the Canadian Motorsports Hall of Fame because he's trained many Canadian racing legends he did a little bit of direct raising himself but he was mainly a trainer and a manager and he's a really funny guy I highly suggest you watch the video with them it's it's both informative and entertaining but in any case he was diagnosed with skin cancer on his ear and they were going to have to cut off his ear in order to get the cancer out and he was telling a friend you know about that he was not looking forward losing his ear and the friends like have you heard of weed oil that was what he called and he's like no and and he said that he could use that to eliminate the cancer and not wanting to lose his ear he gave it a shot and then he eliminated in three and a half weeks of total time treatment that wasn't continuous because he had to take a couple business trips to Dallas but the total time of treatment was three and a half weeks and he saved his ear and most interestingly he also helped to other skin cancer patients one of his friends wives had cancer also in the ear she was facing a very similar prognosis and he was able to get her three grams of cannabis oil which she used continuously and was able to eliminate it in about three weeks and another friends wife had a melanoma on her leg which most of it was removed with surgery but in between the stitching's there was some remaining cancer so they just put it over the stitching's and that eliminated that so it can work you know what traditional treatment or alone and finally in terms of the individual cases I want to talk about ELISA orwen who demonstrates both the amazing potential and limits of cannabis extracts she was diagnosed with grade 3 and a plastic astrocytoma at a young age in 2011 and even with chemotherapy and radiation that was only expected to extend her life to 18 months to two years so she did a few months of chemotherapy before her family learned about cannabis oil as an actual way to save her life and she stopped the chemotherapy and began using the cannabis oil and when the it began changing the tumor morphology and she did use some radiation about six weeks of radiation but mainly used used cannabis oil and was cancer-free by January 2013 and that was completely unexpected even with large amounts of radiation and chemotherapy she was not expected to live so there she is so one thing that's been found in the movement is that you need a maintenance dose to stay in remission this is also common with chemotherapy many people stay on a dose of maintenance chemotherapy because there are we'll cancer cells and especially with brain cancers they are very recurrent and aggressive and although her family knew about the importance of maintenance doses for several reasons including access problems they were not able to do it and the cancer returned in July 2014 and again she was this time she was given just weeks to live and it was it was bad again you know no hope of life but sees so this time she she went harder combining radiation and cannabis oil and as of April 2015 is 75 percent cancer-free which again was completely unexpected and said impossible by the doctors so it's awesome what she's been able to do of course doctors are the pinnacle of medicine so what are they seeing this guy dr. Jeffery hergenrother is the president of the Society of cannibals clinicians they're actually giving out copies of O'Shaughnessy is outside at the project CBD table which he he writes a lot for so he's worked in emergency medicine I've seen him presented numerous CME accredited conferences and he's just done great work not only with cancer but inflammatory bowel disease and Alzheimer's amazing results that I wish I had time to go into but usually look into him so the first thing he says is you know not all tumors are sensitive to cannabinoids there are some people in some cancers that seem to be resistant although even within these cancers which he points out common lung cancer thyroid and breast there are still exceptions there but some cancers do seem to be resistant however he's found that many more forms of cancer are very responsive I've seen him talk about this at the first patients at a time conference I went to which is one of the largest medical cannabis conferences in the country of the United States and it's it's just crazy he's seeing all these cancers respond and all of it is backed up by the scientific evidence everything is explained by these studies so here's a case he talks about in our Shaughnessy's Journal again there is actually the spring 2015 issue of o'Shaughnessy's outside and this is a young patient with an optic pathway glioma that was treated only with cannabis or and over 16 months there was a 95% regression of the glioma in this case the the black thing there is this the oh nice that's a cyst that was not affected by the treatment but the glioma itself was so again you know some there's some things that seems to be resistant but in this case the the most pressing aspect was managed with cannabis oil alone and I want to mention Lindsey Carter because he is a really good demonstration of dose response he's been traveling from the Australia to the United States to meet with dr. Hogan Wrather and was using cannabis oil to treat a brain tumor it's he can't get radiation or chemotherapy because I believe of some kind of genetic abnormality he has but so every T's been over 4 times now I'm not sure what the results from the fourth trip were but the first 3 times he went over he saw a marked shrinkage in the brain tumor and then we've come back to Australia and stopped using it the tumor would grow again so you know when he had the oil it reduced when he didn't it grow and as amazing his cannabis oil is it's not magic you take it away it's not gonna keep killing the cancer that's just how it is and then here's dr. hergenrother comments about how unethical and frankly evil it is to withhold this medicine especially from terminal cancer patients it's you know especially with them they have nothing to lose and to take away any chance at hope is just absurd and I want to mention in dr. Alan Frankel who I also had the chance to meet at this year's patient at a time conference and one of his interesting observations is that with very low doses of cannabinoids people are seeing effectiveness against cancer most people are using hundreds of milligrams a day or just rounding to one gram a day of cannabis oil which of course could rain from you know 300 to 800 milligrams of cannabinoids but um people need to be open to the possibility that they'll either need much less than a gram or in some cases much more than a gram to see success so there are many different approaches that can be successful and it's all about the individual patient taking the approach that works for them and a doctor at fine Lansky he's a great guy I actually found him just randomly while looking for informational and Zack Klein at the Australian conference that many of us here presented at and I just came across him he had treated a patient with a brain tumor I'm using a CBD rich oil and within eight months the tumour had shrunk by 75% in some rare cases CBD oil alone does seem to be able to kill cancers but in the vast majority of cases and really in every case ideally there should be some THC or in many cases very substantial amounts of THC that seems to be more potent against cancer than CBD in general but of course they're best used together and then moving on to some caregivers I've worked with shamanic healing a california-based organization for about a year and a half now he actually doesn't produce the decarboxylated products anymore which is the THC and CBD he's specializing in the raw tinctures so THC and CBD a which do have some effectiveness against cancer but are especially effective against some of spasticity and neurological problems and inflammation so they're they're very powerful products and I've seen some crazy things in patients with his tinctures so here's the statement he provided me you can read it he's helped dozens of cancer patients beat their cancers with extracts and most of them have either come to him after chemotherapy animation radiation and failed or they made the personal decision to take a 100% natural approach and his success rate has been amazing he's only lost two patients and I think a big reason of that is that he is very very adamant about integrating nutrition and spiritual practices with the extract so he's all about no gluten no sugar no dairy high greens high Omega 3 getting in touch with your your spiritual self and when you do these things and you you attack it like Stephanie Lulu LaRue said you show up and you're part of your healing then the human body is capable of incredible things that we don't give it credit for another great organization in California is Epsilon apothecaries one of the things they're most well-known for is producing this guide that shows people how to make their own cannabis products including thca tinctures I actually met a woman at the Americans for safe access conference in March who used this guy to make a THC a tincture for her child with epilepsy that was working very well to control the seizures there are many cases where CBD does not work well against seizures and THC acid works very well so that's been a very great boon to the movement having that available and then here's his statement that he provided me and in this he differentiates between remission and cancer-free since many of the patients he's worked with were terminal the remissions were classified as when the cancer had gone away to the point where it was no longer threatening life whereas cancer free is as it sounds complete cancer free and as you can see he's seen amazing success with a wide variety of cancers and he's also very passionate about implementing new to integrating nutrition with cannabis oil and then the last organization I want to talk about is Harborside Health Center you'd think that if people were seeing anti-cancer effects with cannabis than the largest Spencer II not only in the US but this is the largest Spencer II in the world you know you would think that they would be hearing about this and indeed the owner Stephen DeAngelo he appeared in the trailer for a new documentary that hopefully will come out soon but um you know he says he is skin cancer patients coming in every week this is the largest dispensary in the world seeing these results this is not a not a skin cancer from harbor side but just one that's online I'm a well-known treatment so it's it's being reported by you know people and from all walks of life of course there are limits there are some cancers and some people that for some reason or another seem to be resistant there's all kinds of reasons for this such as damage to endocannabinoids systems or different variants of the cannabinoid receptors because we all have cb1 and cb2 but there's like at least five splice variants of cb1 and possibly many many more so that's something that we need to learn a lot more about also there's the idea that you always want to take very large doses and in general most people have had success using hundreds of milligrams but some people need a lot less and for some people using too much is actually not going to work so it's really important to start low and go slow when treating cancer or any disease and of course nutrition is critical cannabis extracts alone will never be the answer to ending cancer it's an integrative integrative treatment I like to say the four pillars of Health are nutrition exercise meditation and cannabis extract medicine and when you really implement these things together you can see remarkable healing effects nationals with cancer but with a wide variety of diseases and of course maintenance dosing is critical while some people seem to be ok without it you know you never want to take that chance and there's definitely people who absolutely need it in order to stay in remission but with maintenance dosing you can use a much lower dose than a treatment dose and if it's you're using a maintenance dose with significant quantities of CBD then you're even you're not going to feel any secular activity you'll be able to function well and CBD can actually make you function better it's an you know largely non psychoactive molecule of course in high doses there can be and even in small doses for some people some psychoactivity but in general it's a very safe way and to do a maintenance dose and be able to go about your life oh yeah and of course relatively little formal research we need all of this has been based on anecdotal evidence and oh and that's provided amazing guidance we know so much but there still is no you know full human clinical trials and we need those both the double-blind placebo-controlled but more importantly large-scale observational trials so we can find out what cannabinoid profiles and dosage protocols work best for which cancers in which people so in conclusion both phyto cannabinoids and endocannabinoids have been shown to be effective either at directly killing or inhibiting virtually all major forms of cancers as well as some forms that you guys probably haven't even heard of and although I didn't get to go too much into it there's a lot more evidence suggesting that we're programmed to have cannabinoids kill cancer cells one of the things that happens is cancer cells many types actually express more cannabinoid receptors than the healthy tissue on the the corresponding healthy tissue and this seems to be a defense mechanism so that endocannabinoids can come in and inhibit the cancers and there's even more to it than that but it's just it's pretty overwhelming and you know this has been reported for years I got involved when I told this documentary run from the chair about rick simpson claiming that it and he used the word cure he said it cured cancer and virtually all disease and you think that's crazy there's no way this is gonna pan out but it did you know since then that that was what started it but then since then doctors dispensaries corporations caregivers have all come out reporting these remarkable anti-cancer effects and the science is also continuously coming yet come out showing the underlying molecular mechanisms of how cannabinoids are killing cancer cells so when taken together it's you know it's clear that it's not perfect but it's also a 100 percent clear that it absolutely is killing cancer in many humans just like it's working against epilepsy working against pain all these other conditions it is also working against cancer it's not no exception to this with other diseases so what do we need to do for one I think that all patients no matter the condition should have actions the cannabis extracts but at the very very least at least terminal cancer patients there is absolutely no excuse whatsoever to not allow patients to have this medicine but and there also need thank you but there also need to be the trials that you know formally prove it and terminal cancers are skin cancers seem to be a great place to start with skin cancer especially basal cell carcinoma which is the least aggressive form of skin cancer you know you can see results very quickly and non-psychoactive lee since it's all topical although using internal and topical treatments in those cases is still i'm a good thing to do and terminal cancer patients if people want to do it if they look at the evidence and they want to have a shot at living then you know that that's a good place to start so there's no reason that you guys can't start doing this right now i know there's a lot of you know there's there's cannabis in this country you can start extracting it i don't know what your lab situation is but if you can test it and start running these trials as soon as possible i'm if you were serious you could have proof that cannabis at least kills skin cancer in a couple weeks so this is very urgent people are dying every single day these patients only have many of them only have days to live and every single second is unbearable agony one thing that I hate is that there's this this lack of urgency in the mainstream scientific community now we need to wait you know we need to wait years for all these trials but that's that's just BS so we need to use this now and but there you know there needs to be the research as well yeah so these are all the references and that's all thank you so much again and hopefully you learned a lot"
zX3Dad9-7oI,"Dr Andrew Katelaris in Nimbin, The Medical Cannabis Workshop, II.part",2015-09-04T08:31:23Z,"okay medical uses this is a tiny tiny little list I don't know how many of you saw the the inside program run by Jenny Brockie a few months ago when they're actually covering the idea of medical medical cannabis but she objected to my suggestion that there probably wasn't a significant human health condition on earth that wasn't in some ways responsive to cannabis therapy and she objected on the basis that nothing can be that good but if the underlying disease processes all result from an dysfunction of the regulatory system the endocannabinoid system you can have one medication that can affect a whole range of very very unrelated conditions I mean you might ask what does pediatric epilepsy and Crohn's disease have in common apart from the fact that they both respond dramatically to CBD dominant cannabis my attitude in science is you look for the effect first and the explanation second you don't put the cart before the horse okay thanks is alright the big question and whatever it wants to know does cannabis cure cancer now at this stage to use a hackneyed phrase the jury is still out this is my experiences so far about two years ago I was confronted by a lady who I'd been providing some sort of I suppose you called naturopathic health care dietary health care during a 16-year battle with breast cancer and we kept it going quite a while just with dietary strategies and things like that but it got out of hand and the cancer actually invaded into her arm until her brachial plexus which is the big nerve that governs the arm and not only was the arm paralyzed but she was faced with intolerable neuropathic pain neuropathic pain is a pain to rise from damaged nurse and she and her family arrived on my doorstep on one Sunday morning everyone in tears mum sort of you know thrashing around him saying the doctor said she's going to die what can you do at that stage Rick Simpson oil wasn't very much used this as a few years ago now and that packet of pound that I showed you was what we went and got for her and I made up the rick simpson oil using a we used the hexane extraction then and because of the the desperate nature of the situation I really Doster immoderately I'd have to say it was very very very heavy heavy dosing and she spent 18 to 20 hours unconscious on a couch but within 10 days the pain in the arm had stopped and over the next few weeks she regained function of her arm all right now I thought my word you know it's all over we've got the answer and I went on to treat five more patients in the same way and none of them responded right so we're nowhere near at the end of it and what I've come to appreciate is health and disease is a very complex interaction between the environment the individual their conditioning and the therapeutic options that are aware to them and it's very hard to make generalizations about anyone now the there is no doubt no doubt whatsoever that there's a huge indicators of efficacy or indicators of positive action of cannabis against cancer all right it's done the models that have been investigated we use either tissue culture where you actually get a the cancer cells growing in a petri dish or you inject those cancer cells into a normal into an immune deficient animal and then you develop a human cancer on a mouse or whatever whatever other animal you care to do and in in those tissue culture and animal models various forms of cannabis have demonstrated dramatic anti-cancer effects now unlike chemotherapy when chemotherapy drugs like cytotoxic drugs and remember most people aren't aware who knows we chemotherapy got its start from as anyone aware now gas attacks from the First World War right that the Germans through some mustard gas at the British and the British surgeons noticed that the bone marrow had been wiped out and said oh why don't we give this to leukemic patients which they did and admittedly it had a good effect for the first couple of weeks but then because of the destruction of the immune system they went on to relapse and died but yet chemotherapy has grown out of gas warfare from the First World War so it's not a very salubrious way to actually develop a therapeutic now I really do want to stress that first thing does cannabis cure cancer there is always the primacy of prevention / treatment right if you want to cure cancer don't get it in the first place now i know that's a glib thing to say and there's different types of cancer there's the cancers that are unequivocally associated with lifestyle right the small cell lung cancer associated with smoking the thyroid cancer associated with radiation exposure you know there's some at the even the breast cancer to a point associated with being overweight and having a high animal fat intake in your diet and things like that there's clear things there's other tumors especially in three year olds or others that have no clear environmental trigger and you don't know what's actually going on there's a lot of possibilities the doctors at this stage are saying we don't know why you've got cancer and they seem to abrogate the individual responsibility what is cancer you all know cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells and the lack of what they call contact inhibition normally when cells grow once they start touching each other they stop growing that's contact inhibition cancer doesn't have contact inhibition and it just goes on and on like that now the biology of cancer is not very well understood and there's a lot of misconceptions which has led to some strange strange treatments the first one is that cancer is monoclonal that means it's got one cell type that's gone bad when you start to look at the cancers more carefully it's clearly polyclonal that means you're dealing with more than one cell line so often when you receive treatment with radiation or chemotherapy or some other form of therapy it can work very effectively against one of the clones but not against the others so the usual pattern of having chemo therapeutic treatment is you'd normally get an excellent response you've got big lumps coming out of your body and doc gives you the weed killer into your arm and the things go why is how I look mum's timmons getting smaller that's what happens normally in the first untreated cancer something like ninety percent of the cells are sensitive to whatever treatment you give them but what's left the ones that are left the ten percent are now resistant and if you've been irradiated it's worse than that the radiation actually develops what they call resistant cancer stem cells and they go on to repopulate the recurrence or the relapse with resistance cells so the next dose of treatment that you give has to be much more toxic in much higher levels to even get the same result and the result of treating with chemotherapy or radiation is a bouncing ball effect the first result the ball bounces nice and high the second one it bounces about half and then about a quarter and then barely at all and that's the response of chemotherapy it's really with very few exceptions and those exceptions RB testicular cancer and hodgkin's lymphoma which appeared to have long-term responses by that I mean more than 10 years most of the chemotherapy is and even isn't effect right it that means it works for a while but then it ceases to be effective in just the same way as we've overused antibiotics and now we have a whole suite of resistant germs that don't respond to the antibiotics in the same way with the cancer after they've been exposed to an agent or two they develop resistance it's not a static theme it's an adaptive infiltrating sort of entity that learns from what you do to it and takes efforts to evade both your immune system and the chemicals and the radiations are thrown at it so our hang on models of cares or clinical case reports there are a couple of well documented case reports of dramatic responses to cancer probably one that should have got a lot more attention than it did was in the Johns Hopkins Hospital this is on the internet a fourteen-year-old boy had what they call a Philadelphia positive chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia which is a particularly nasty hematological malignancies right and this kid was in johns hopkins university hospital where they treat like what we call cavalier treatment he was receiving enormous doses of chemotherapy anything they had they were giving to him in series now your white cells should be below about 11,000 he's white cells were 300,000 right so it gives you an idea the extent of his disease and with all the chemotherapy the leukemic cell index was going up on treatment and that's so real what we called a negative prognostic indicator it usually means there's no hope at all now the family as is often the case in these dying types that we really want to try cannabis and after the usual sort of foot dragging and things like that they decided that yeah the kid was obviously dying so what harm was there and they gave him some cannabis oil for a week and there's very little change in his state and then they change to a different oil and over the next five days there was a daily and major step rise reduction right he'd experienced a major tumor response unfortunately on the fifth day he died as a result of a hemorrhage which had been induced by the prior chemotherapy now as a measure of how scientifically corrupt the people are at the Johns Hopkins they didn't analyze the cannabis oil the second cannabis oil now to me that's tantamount to I mean it's it's a crime against humanity because it's clear now there are different combinations of cannabinoids that have more or less effect some oils do some good and some oils don't and at this stage we can't know what but at that particular individual case we had a chance to look at the differences between a non effective and an effective treatment and that's been lost for all eternity now you just look at the science of the people that opposes here's someone said oh yeah we got a response to cannabis I said well what was in it what was it it's like saying we've got a response to tablets right it's just pathetic that scientists can behave in this way it's just as the same say old cannabis does this or that it really does dependent we have to get a lot more subtle and a lot more detailed in the way we actually view medical cannabis because there's very very significant differences now the difference between a human response to cannabis and a tuba response to chemotherapy is massive when you give someone chemotherapy the cells that are affected die by the process of necrosis necrosis simply means death because the cells swell up and burst and it's quite a messy and inflammatory condition when cells interact with cannabinoids they don't go through necrosis they go to actually we have the next slide I think they go through a process apoptosis or autophagy and these are basically physiological processes so when when you're a little embryo in utero remember your hands start off as a little blob and then by the process of apoptosis they're actually remodeled the extra skin is cut away so the apoptosis is they call it cell suicide you can you can say that but what it is it's an energy dependent process where the cell actually pumps out its own fluid it's a bit like you're sort of open a tap and squeeze out all the fluid and the sill goes from this size to this size and then it's just taken up by immune cells and recycled the beauty of it is it involves no inflammation it's a very tidy process and it completely leaves alone normally transformed cells so if you have saved fifty percent cancer cells fifty percent fibroblast in a petri dish and you put the cannabinoids in you'll you'll delete the cancer cells without affecting transformed cell like normal cells and that's a huge difference between that and most of the chemotherapeutic agents the other important effect of cannabis is the inhibition of angiogenesis angiogenesis just means the development of new blood supply right when you've got a tiny gym a lesson a couple of millimeters it doesn't need a blood supply because all the nutrients can infuse into it but to get bigger to get more than a couple of centimeters it has to make blood vessels grow and if you can stop the blood vessels from growing you can choke off the tumor or slow up its growth now the allopathic doctors are developing various hormone and abiding things aimed at attacking the angiogenesis factors but there they haven't had a good clinical response with with cannabis it appears to be let me try and make this balanced in all the patients we've treated we've only seen a couple of dramatic remissions right but in many of them we've seen a significant slowing of the disease and so many times the doctor said I've got three months to live and two years later they're still coming to see as for their oil and things like that there is no doubt cannabis slows up the growth of tumor whether it's a direct effect on the tumor itself or by enhancing the person's will be in recruiting their immune system against it it may be both the other thing is increased intercellular adhesion now the cells in our body all the cells in our body are joined by these little things called desmos owns and they stick the cells together but with I age and junk food and all the other things the the gaps between ourselves get loose and it makes it relatively easy for metastasis to take root with cannabis has a clear effect of increasing intracellular at ease and it basically shoulders the Mets out so these are effects we've seen the slowing of the rate of metastasis and the growth of the tumors and our mission at the moment is to refine our therapeutics to actually increase the rates of actual remission that we get this is okay why are we not getting better results than we're getting in the field of cancer treatment my particular Byers is that most of the people that come to us firstly they're usually coming at the end of three or four cycles of chemo and a bit of radiation and they're suffering from severe long-term hypo nutrition with multiple significant deficiencies specifically omega-3 iodine zinc and selenium and many others now I'll talk about those because they're all important I'll come back to that the other thing and probably the main stumbling block to people's wellness is that their presents for their own habits and those habits can be habits of behavior or habits of thought there's nothing more corrosive to the human psyche than negative thoughts whether they're coming from outside but more specifically if they're coming from inside and when you're actually kinesiology the use kinesiology to test people to see what their belief and whether they get better or not a lot of people are plagued by fear and doubts about about their outcomes and that almost guarantees a negative outcome 90 it's hard to keep a positive outlook when you're confronted by a malignant growth but what else can you do okay especially radiation generates these resistant cancer stem cells and in many cases they make the treatment almost guaranteed to fail the problem with radiation as in the problem with chemo is you do get an initial good effect and from time to time very regrettably we've had to send some of our less successful patients along for focused radiation to control things like particularly painful bony Mets or a situation or it might be critical in their nervous system or something like that but normally by the time we've done that we've accepted the fact that we're not going to have a cure and we're in holding mode but radiation yeah short-term gain but long-term pain by a long way with the chemotherapy and not only affects that humor to fix every cell in your body and that's witness by the fact that your hair falls out you got passes blood and all the rest of it you're infertile but from a cancer-fighting point of view if you don't have a highly honed digestive system and a very effective immune system you're really not going to win and that's why chemotherapy can't win because it doesn't recognize the fact that the cancer and the human host the reluctant human host is in a relationship with each other and you can't treat one without looking at the factors in the other and it's without a digestive system to nourish the body in an immune system to delete the cancers your treatments are only going to be of limited effectiveness at the best of times some tumors appear to lack receptors cb1 and cb2 receptors now very little work has been done on that but the way I see things going forward is that once someone has a tumor biopsy in the future I'd like to think we'll do cb1 and cb2 essays on them at that stage and direct the people with high density of receptors straight to us rather than let them go through a whole lot of other treatments before they come to us at a stage when is less effect where it's likely to be less effective now the big question there is is it only via the CB 1 and 2 receptors that the cannabis has its effect and the answer is a resounding no and he seems to have three different effects right operating on the receptor is the first one and that appears to maturate the cell it'll either cause it to commit suicide or it'll make it go back to a more normal cell the fact that cancer can be cured by cannabis is very well illustrated by our treatment of basal cell carcinomas basal cell will be CCS are the very common form of skin cancer we started experimenting with bccs because even though they can be very destructive and grow very large they don't metastasize so we're not going to put people at risk for instance I wouldn't use cannabis treatment topically on a melanoma I don't think that's wise at this stage even though it may influence the surface ones it's it's probably in my mind at this stage of melanomas are much better dealt with by primary surgical excision hopefully in an expert unit because melanomas are different than a lot of cancers once i get to a certain depth they will metastasize and the metastasis are difficult to deal with so unlike some people that slather them with black selves and a whole lot of other poems and unguents I really take a great deal of care and respect with melanomas with bccs we don't have to because we know if we fail and they get out of control you can always go back to a surgeon and have it grafted if necessary but that hasn't been necessary in the way it's work for us it's gone the other way we're getting the people that the surgeons have rejected we've got a famous case that we treated early this year the lady came in and she had a hideous BCC she was about 70 country girl and been there for years I've been meaning to get something done about this but by the time she finally went to see a surge and he looked at it says Christ lady we're going to have to amputate your nose right that's a big thing specially if you're wearing glasses though you try that without but yeah it's a hideous deformity and she said well what can you do and i said look give us a month see how we go and long story short yeah she got better alright it's funny ever way you go back you go back to the doctors it's not me mate it's a herd but I don't forget that anyone can put the herb on she went back to the doctors they don't want to know about it I had one patient she had breast cancer admittedly it was only an early stage we got needle biopsy on it was an early stage breast cancer with no nodes and so we went on any we didn't even use cannabis in her just an intensive nutritional weight-loss program six months later she went back to the surgeon had the repeat ultrasound a repeat examination and the husband looked at he says well he says there's no cancer and the husband said do you know would you like to know what we've done he says I've got no interest he said you can go now right this is a sort of closed mindedness that is leading to the situation we're in an ideologically rather than scientifically driven medical system okay the next thing is a poor quality and quantity of herb and that's sad I mean we're all aware that there is a undercurrent of reports going on in the medical in the pseudo medical industry there is and I recognize a growing army of compassionate people that are risking their own life and freedom to produce medicine for people I don't think they need a pat on the back I think it's just a self obvious thing to do but there are others that don't and sick and vulnerable people are being ripped off both by the fact that the black market prices and the fact that people are making medical preparations are very poor quality and that's certainly responsible for some of the failures okay the politics of cannabis now does anyone recognize what that is that's an American herbicide plane flying Agent Orange over Vietnam now remember does everyone know what this is all about back in the 60s the Vietcong were basically winning the guerrilla war because they could go and hide in the jungle and they use the Ho Chi Minh Trail to sort of bring supplies in from the north the Americans way around that I think they dumped something like 23 million liters of this agent orange herbicide on the jungles and deforested a huge amount of the country now the politics of these people i think was made by dell or monsanto i'm not sure they took shortcuts in the mall in the manufacture of this material the 240 and the 24 d and heavily contaminated with dioxin Dodson is the most potent chemical carcinogen to me right literally a cupful could wipe out australian population if it was distributed that way it's bizarre in its longevity and its potency to cause disease worse than that ecor dioxin causes diseases in the germline there's a difference between a processor causes of disease in the subject but this one causes a disease in the subjects children and those children's children so we're seeing Agent Orange victims now three generations post-exposure right there's five million Vietnamese children affected by this now this is the politics of the people that gave you the prohibition we're dealing with sociopaths right it's no point in calling it anything else I say we live in a pharmaco fascist society they've used drug policy to control the people and it's very much a case in the health system of the Fox minding the pigeons I feel there is unequivocal evidence that they have consciously degraded the food supply and made us vulnerable to cancer and then peddling snake oil killers at us in the form of chemotherapy and radiation yeah listen I mentioned snake snake oil cures the irony is it turns out the original snake oil salesmen used to peddle an extract of the chinese water snake and it turned out to be twenty percent omega-3 so it's likely that the snake oil salesmen did a lot more good than eli lilly and all that row tional all the other buggers in their suits okay politics are a big thing though now we're seeing a breakdown of the prohibition there's no doubt there's cracks in the edifice it happens that we live in one of the right-wing countries right wing by default unfortunately Australia's become an iron fist with a velvet glove so it looks like a relaxed laid-back thing bit of a nanny state in fact it's a pharmaco fashion state and we're seeing worrying signs the rollout of the Draeger saliva machines is a bizarre bizarre backward step in this country because i think the right-wing forces are actually using saliva testing as a way of controlling things even if they lose the battle about medical and recreational cannabis they say yeah you can have your medicine neighbor will catch you on the street and we'll take your driver's license away the only way around that we have to and we must become more vocal in our opposition to the saliva test for a number of reasons the first reason is they don't contribute to traffic safety and the only reason for doing these things is for traffic safety the only type of test that influences traffic safety are impairment based tests and the whole thing of drawing the chalk line and getting you to walk along it is a better test than a saliva test the saliva test that though used in Australia were tested in Europe and discounted and discontinued on the basis that they were unreliable they gave too many false positives that means they showed up positive when you should not have been positive and they're a major incursion against a person's right to move about by testing just the saliva and usually for cannabis and remember they don't test for pharmaceutical drugs like benzodiazepines like valium or like antihistamines or like the sleeping tablets which are very clearly represented in fatal traffic accidents all right so we're completely off the track and now as a time before these things become entrenched to make a lot of noise and and organized resistance against this or we'll find ourselves in a situation where we win the battle and lose the war okay it really is something that I worry a lot about okay okay models for progress now I repeat my assertion that the prohibition is problem not the plant and once that is borne in mind there is no point in just letting the door open a little bit right the basic underlying assumption in the government is always still a danger plant you'll still get psychosis but looks like some of it helps medically that's not the way it is cannabis in all its forms is the safest there appeared equally active substance known to mankind I can say that without fear of contradiction both in terms of its ld50 and I'll explain that to you see can involve yourself in arguments with others ld50 stands for the lethal dose that will kill half the population exposed to it I with alcohol say you have the normal social intake of alcohol might be five drinks say that's 50 grams of alcohol if you have three times out of four times that you're at significant risk of dying so the ld50 is for a relatively modest number with something like water if two liters is your intake and you have 20 you may die of brain swelling so it's ld50 is 10 and it goes like that most drugs are in those small numbers cannabis has an estimated ld50 of 40,000 right there is nothing like that table salt is probably down to about 50 right so are you getting the idea it really is in a class of its own and that's why I feel completely relaxed in advocating a three-tier system of supply the bad government and all the other right-wing half-wits that are performing governments around this country are getting their knickers in a knot over supply or wears a drug got to come from because of its overwhelming safety and its complete freedom from organ toxicity I feel that the basic starting point of a medical cannabis regime is a removal of the prohibition humans can sort themselves out they don't need a nanny state which has done nothing but pedal lies and confusion on the subject since 1937 and before home growing don't worry about that home growing has several really major advantages firstly and primarily it's a basic human right not to be told by the state what you can and can't ingest right the only place the has that right to intervene is where that impacts on other people things like drink-driving I'm very much in favor of a lot of breath testing because there is a clear and unequivocal association between alcohol use and a dose response and and traffic outcomes it's clear in Colorado after a full medical cannabis regime of only 12 months there was a measurable decrease in fatal traffic accidents in suicides and in domestic violence right there being very quiet about that a measurable decrease in all of those things so they can't use the idea of traffic safety to justify their saliva test when they're not actually testing for benzos or any of the other sedating allopathic drugs it is a worry proxy growing large and small-scale this is our second tier where people like arts like the nimbin people like everyone who's been involved for the last few years can take on a number of patients they might have a particular interest in epilepsy or in ms or in cancer treatment or whatever particular feel that they're interested in and then they can recruit a number of patients that they'll be looking after so I might take on a thousand epileptic children and therefore if each of them need three pounds a year I'll have a license to grow 3,000 pounds of cannabis and we just keep records on that at that scale of growing you can afford to have an HPLC machine and do things in a proper scientific way now the third tier and only the third tier is pharmaceutical production everyone's familiar with GW Pharmaceuticals they're a group in England that actually got started back in the 90s with the help of Prince Charles who was actually approached by the MS Society members at some stage and he actually pushed it through for them so good on Prince Charles but pharmaceutical production and prescription by doctors should only be one of the three possible methods I am very much and it's not only a question of sour grapes but on very much opposed to a profession that spent 70 years opposing the medical use of animas now having the only right to prescribe it it's simply not ride yeah all right medical cannabis is only a small part of the cannabis story we talk about revolution now we talk about a hemp revolution we talk about a transition from a hydrocarbon economy to a carbohydrate economy these things are achievable we're talking about not achieving our Kyoto Protocol targets but exceeding them by multiples this is possible and unlike what they do in say as it won't involve a reduction in living standards in fact the widespread application of industrial hemp for the production of paper for the production of hemp plastics production of building materials these things can be an economic engine to develop the country a massive amount of import substitution and a huge potential for quality job growth and export we can do that now listen what do you think of a country when you do that to its grow Oh gold growth forest that appears as a positive on the country's balance of payments so if you chop the Economist that are running this world and morons if not psychopaths they say you go and chop down your old growth forest and then you put it in your ledger is something that's good you've generated two hundred million dollars worth timber exports to Japan but you've also degraded your country its life and its waters so we're dealing with voodoo economics and they're not leading us to a brighter future okay building materials hempcrete is an ideal building material we've we've done our first little little project here just to test the material it is fantastic it's like working in adult plasticine once you've decided to build something with hempcrete any shape you want to do any form of building you can do it's brilliant but I we're not even at the beginning of our learning learning curve with that and we can do so many good things at once see people come to us for medicine but then we're trying to intervene in a person's lifestyle on factors that we don't have much control over so you give them some cannabis but you send them back to their new house in their new car outgassing all these volatile organic compounds and then the house is just full of electromagnetics morgue and things like that there's only so much intervention you can do to have an effect without doing everything and it really is a major step for people fighting cancer they think they can take a bit of cannabis or make a few minor changes to their diet to be successful in treating metastatic cancer involves almost a total mind-body application some people have done it and hopefully as we develop the methodology will become more successful than what we are okay at nicks as everyone aware of him the hemp car made by Henry Ford in 1941 yeah it was featured in their documentary billion-dollar crowd go crop back in the 90s there's Henry Ford smashing at this plastic car made in 1941 why was that documentary buried not only was it buried the American government took its index card out of the library of congress we went over there in 1994 we're aware of it from Jack arrears and email and we went looking for it so we were there with our film crew and you could go through the cards now let's say was number seven you go through 568 where's number seven we went to the librarian said where's number seven he knew what we were there for we had the cameras we had that I love pot t-shirts and things like that but he had no explanation right at one stage the explanation was offered it confused the kids they might think pot is better than what it is all right well we better confuse our children i think if that's the case all right well that's all i've got to say on the subject for now and who once he organizes whether we have questions now or later thank you so much I'm really grateful for that talk dr. Cottle eres I just have one question about one of the slides that you were going to come back to in the treatment of cancer and you were talking specifically about the the nutritional deficiencies and how omega-3 zinc magnesium and there was maybe one other one those specific minerals and nutrients deficiencies in our in our kind of corporate diet that's out there how those deficiencies relate to viendo can unkind of cannabinoid system and the treatment of cancer alright um that's a big question and a good question and I can't give a definitive answer the one where it's clear that I already highlighted without having the right lipids going into your diet in the form of hemp seed and flax and cheer and things like that your cell membranes simply don't form in the right way that can be then used to produce the endocannabinoids right but there's much more to it and in the body it's a case of you know no man's an island complete in itself we're all part of the whole I'll just divert a little bit i mentioned selenium for instance now selenium because this touches on supplements too so I'm taking a bit of Liberty with that question to bring up another point there was an experiment selenium is a critical trace micro element that used to make an enzyme called glutathione reductase glutathione is a major antioxidant in the body the intrinsic antioxidant so antioxidants can occur in the body or in the diet and you need them both without selenium you don't make glutathione you don't have the intracellular antioxidants and you're much more prone to cancer and other diseases now they did an experiment in New Zealand last year where they took I think 20 20 to 50 people and they put them on selenium tablets which are an expensive way to take selenium they put the others on to Brazil nuts a day now Brazil nuts concentrate selenium and at the end of three months they measured the blood levels of selenium and they found that in the tablet groove and the Brazil nut group the levels were more or less the same but when they measured the amount of glutathione in the two grooves they found that the Brazil nut Grove had three times as much glutathione activity alright so nutrition is incredibly complicated it's not only the primary nutrient that you're after you're after the minor cofactors as well so I don't delude myself into thinking we had such a good grasp of human physiology that we understand the subtleties of how things work and you can't improve on nature right an elemental diet made up in a chemist laboratory can't be as good as fruit and vegetables you might say why not but it's not there are dozens of minor elements that interact together like an orchestra right so the function of the endocannabinoid system really depends on the functioning of all the systems but the one key nutrient is the leopard intake and the imbalance of three and six and the over intake of saturated fats earlier you alluded to an amount for a cancer responds second you alluded to an amount of cannabis or an amount of CBDs or amount of an amount to get a cancerous response is what is that amount that seems to be a magical number yeah now the amounts not known there does this look there seems to be two very different ways of using cannabis in cancer right now the usual one the the prior way the rick simpson sort of fee just load them up and they'll be okay all right we've had a lot of trouble with rick simpson oil i have to say right there's a lot of intolerance a lot of inability to actually tolerate it and the people have said to me look even if I die it's better than going through that sort of thing again that's not everyone's view but there is a fair amount of intolerance now what I'm increasingly doing now because our primary intervention against cancer is dietary and I'm increasingly using cannabis in a dose that's dictated by the patient's well-being so I say how much should I take and I say take the amount that best enhances your life so we're using it as an indirect effect via the psychopharmacol as psycho immunological connection between being happy and having a vibrant immune system now having said that in the test tube it does appear to be a fair bit of evidence that there's a dose response so say you've got cancer cells and you put in five micrograms no response 10 no response 15 good response 20 better response there is a dose response all right but whether we can translate the dose response in the test tube into the human body is another matter right what I found say for instance and we're constantly confronted by people with ovarian cancer now ovarian cancer is a very lethal form of cancer because it presents late and they end up with metastasis in the stomach or in the in the abdomen which interferes with their digestion of food so with those people we're experimenting with the idea of actually introducing the cannabis by injection in a similar way see it's working so well for the BCC's because you get a very high local dose right very high local does and it's simply not possible to eat enough cannabis to get the sort of doses we're getting on the skin right I don't know my way around that and it may be that is just not a practical strategy but we are preparing ourselves scientifically now for looking at injecting cannabinoids strategically in places to give very high local levels okay but it's still very early days on that does that answer your question you are there certain well I don't know about a saturation point but I have seen people who as their disease is getting out of control they take the dose ride out and it does become negative you can have too much oil there's no doubt about that and I think at the higher levels it can even become immune suppressant right and also lying around for 18 or 20 hours a day at a time it's not conducive to regaining good health all right so yeah I'm struggling with sorting that out at the moment but I'm at the moment we're actually moving more towards using patient directed dosages where they're operating on their well-being as the end point rather than some idea of one gram a day as per the Simpson method hmm not an easy question to answer have you seen yourself in the good weekend man this is a good weekend magazine this weekend dr. pot have you seen that not happening okay get over my mom so so it's so nice to hear a doctor say look I'm not sure about that we're still working that out you never hear doctors say that I love hearing that so I reckon we should have a bake and then Chris Harris a local healer alchemist is going to talk simoes made terrific and the real hemp seed food out there and I think and we'll hang around and you'll get a chance to talk to him out there when the talks come back on say in 15 minutes will close that door though so if you're outside try and keep the noise down a bit make a donation out the front for Gail the cost of everything and really appreciate your coming is near

ZNiZyV4nmSM,Are You For Legalizing Medical Marijuana or Against It,2015-07-31T16:03:46Z,hi and welcome to mondays with marlo i'm really interested in this topic today because we have so many questions from our viewers about marijuana should it be legalized is it good for you will it kill you does it give you lung cancer is it uh really something that people should be taking medically and it's wonderful that we have one of the great great thank you newsman my husband is such a fan oh well thank you yes and uh and of course is the chief correspondent medical correspondent for cnn and you've done a three-part series on this called weed that's right so you've done three and you're about to do your fourth we're working on our fourth yeah isn't that great yeah a lot of lot of interest in the stock yeah but you used to be against marijuana completely and now you're what i think medicinal marijuana has a real role in our society and i think it's it's one of these things that uh in part as a doctor but i think in part just as a citizen that you find that not only can it work for people but oftentimes it can work when nothing else has so marla i think this is in part a medical argument but i think it's a moral argument to some extent as well that people would be denied treatment that could potentially help them when nothing else has that's that's the position i've now really started to take

OO8v1a2PgII,Applications open for licenses to grow cannabis for medicinal purposes,2016-10-29T02:23:29Z,growing cannabis is about to become a legitimate industry in Australia on Monday the federal government will start accepting applications from people wanting a license to grow cannabis for medicinal purposes the domestic market is expected to be worth millions but analysts caution the investment is not risk-free this is what a medicinal cannabis farm looks like since the law has changed in Canada in 2014 the industry has become big business and analysts say that could happen here to the medical cannabis market in Australia it could be worth more than 75 million dollars per year but there's still a lot of legal political and regulatory risks these companies have to navigate patients will soon be able to use products like cannabis oils and vaporizers for a range of conditions Ozcan is just one company getting ready to apply for a licence it hopes to have planted a crop in Western Australia by the middle of next year in the key demand areas at this point seems to be chronic neuropathic pain and treatment resistant epilepsy Ozcan is getting ready to list on the Australian Stock Exchange where it will join three other medicinal cannabis companies but one prominent advocate has decided not to apply for a licence for now it has potential to be a very cutthroat industry Luci Haslam pushed for change after her son Daniel developed bowel cancer her family bought a farm to grow a crop but now feel there may not be room for them in the cashed up industry Luci Haslam is going to focus her efforts on education she's worried if people don't understand the new system they'll keep buying cannabis illegally the risk in that is making a system that's so convoluted and complicated for patients and for prescribers that it actually doesn't fulfill the reason that it was established in the first place and that people will just stick with the black market the thorny path of bringing an illegal industry into the open market Meredith Griffiths ABC News
GPXNmjxkj_0,Dr Alex Wodak - The Current Status of Medicinal Cannabis in Australia,2016-11-24T22:52:21Z,"so I'm going to talk about the current state of medicinal cannabis in Australia and start off with a quote from Charles Dickens that's very well-known it was the best of times it was the worst of times it was the age of wisdom it was the age of full hardiness some of you may know that just in this last week Prime Minister Tony Abbott said that 2014 was the year of achievement and I don't know whether he was talking about drug law reform in Australia but certainly 2014 was the best year we have ever had he seems to think it was the best year that Australia has ever had but certainly was a good year for drug law reform the case I'm going to be presenting to you today is really to argue that the best way to speed up law reform for the drugs that many in this room are interested the entheogens is to speed up other drug law reforms I think this is going to be a sequential process and I think the antigens whether you like it or not are going to be at the end of a long queue anyway more about that later so I'm going to talk a little bit about political support for medicinal cannabis community support say something about expert opinion summarize that talk about some current diversions which are quite significant where we go from here relationships of the issue of medicinal cannabis to other drug law reforms and then some concluding remarks now we've got some quite significant political support for drug law for medicinal cannabis in Australia Prime Minister Tony Abbott much to everybody's surprise came out in support for medicinal cannabis the New South Wales premier Bob Carr had come out for medicinal cannabis in 2003 but he was rolled by his party that hasn't been said openly but let's face it that's what must have happened and the same thing happened with the current New South Wales liberal premier Mike beard this year in 2014 he was also rolled by his party he wanted to proceed to medicinal cannabis they stopped him seems like the new Victorian premiere might be interested in pursuing this issue let's hope so Tasmanian government we're getting opposing signals from them AC T government bit warmer but so far there was the support has been for research not routine use of a medicine under certain conditions and so far most of the support seems to have been for pharmaceutical agents not botanical cannabis and the reasons I think why pharmaceutical agents existing pharmaceutical agents are problematic I'll talk about that in a moment and right now we've got private member's bills in the federal Senate and also before the New South Wales Parliament never had that before so things are looking good in a way but I would argue that we've never been in a stronger position for medicinal cannabis in Australia as we are right now so that's a positive and we have very strong community support and that's been the case for a long while we had 69 percent support from the community in a very large sample conducted by the his initial stand for the National Drug Strategy household survey both in their 2010 survey published the following year and in the 2013 survey published in the last couple of weeks we had 74 percent support for medicinal cannabis research in both of those surveys 2010 2013 and we had 66 percent support for medicinal cannabis in the July 2014 reach till survey very large sample and very significantly that survey had a majority of voters for the Liberal National Party for the Labour Party for the Greens and for Palmer United Party or Palmer disunited party I suppose it should now be and also that when majorities among in women and among all the for age groups so very strong community support but significantly expert medical opinion is divided whether they should be or shouldn't be factors they are divided one group says the evidence is weak that the risks are unacceptably high especially schizophrenia and other forms of mental illness that conventional medicines rarely fail and if needed we could use reluctant reluctantly we could use cannabinoid pharmaceuticals the second group I'm certainly in the second group say the evidence for efficacy is strong also for safety argues that we have over a hundred randomized control trials being published and the overwhelming majority of those are very favorable the risks are minimal especially when you look at studies of medicinal cannabis rather than studies of recreational cannabis which is what opponents tend to quote the latter literature rather than the former literature these experts also argue that conventional medicines fail far too often and that cannabinoid pharmaceuticals are very problematic I'll say more about that later then we've got a third group who say no it's a natural herb we don't need any evidence there are no risks conventional medicines are dangerous pharmaceuticals companies can't be trusted certainly agree with that and everybody's got a right to use and I think a lot of this is really needs more debate but the key point I want to make to you is that governments rarely move when key expert opinions are seriously divided that's not something that gets set out loud in public but I can tell you that that's something that really happens that a major problem holding this up is the division among experts medical experts law and law enforcement are also divided we have the commander of the of the police in Tamworth in northern New South Wales who said he wouldn't charge a family that's using medicinal cannabis and I'm pleased he made that decision but he wouldn't he would order his own troops his own police not to charge this family using medicinal cannabis or any other families using medicinal cannabis but police in other parts of the country have had no such qualms and they have gone ahead and charged families and they've also reported those families to government departments resulting in potential loss of children to authorities so some very serious divisions among police and we recently had a case in October in Port Macquarie in New South Wales Toni Bowers where the judge upheld an appeal against the sentence where the offender so-called have pleaded guilty and was been found guilty by the court and a previous prison sentence had been changed by this judge on appeal to a 12 months good behavior about a six months good behavior bond so in summary to quote a famous quote by Graham ski the old is dead but the new is not yet born the politicians are declining to support the status quo but there's not enough of them willing to support a change to a new regime strong support in the community and also amongst the media for medicinal cannabis and also for more research on medicinal cannabis research on medicinal cannabis is great we certainly need more of that we hardly do any in Australia but it's not the primary need the primary need I believe is to get on and start treating people the division among law and law enforcement is very troubling the fact that the laws are being enforced in some parts of the country not being enforced in other parts of the country and the division among medical experts is really quite a serious problem for us and another serious problem that doesn't get talked about is the real dilemma that exists around childhood epilepsy and treatment with cannabis and the problem here is that there's a lot of anecdote about this hard to ignore that it's hard moving it's very heart rending stuff but anecdote is powerful but it's not really rigorous science and as of today there are still no rigorous published studies on medicinal cannabis used in young children with epilepsy so it's very difficult in the age of evidence-based medicine to know what the hell we should do there what we've got at the moment what's accepted is unregulated medicinal cannabis pharmaceuticals and research in my view that's a terrible situation to be in let's hope in 2015 we get a bit further than that and I think the support for research with medicinal cannabis is being used as a diversion there's politicians don't know how to thread this issue through the political maze to actually provide medicinal cannabis so they're supporting research as a kind of distraction and they're supporting the big sur moles which is the generic name for product which uses the trade name sativex now Sante vex has got some definite pluses but it's got some significant negatives and the pluses are that it's already registered by the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia but it's only registered for one condition the second plus is that it contains a broad spectrum of cannabinoids rather than just one or two but you have to have spasticity due to multiple sclerosis you have to satisfy stringent criteria and even then your doctor was only allowed to prescribe it to you for a short period and has to apply again it's available in Australia in theory but it's not available in practice and most importantly of all it costs about $500 a month and we have to remember that most of the people who would want to use medicinal cannabis in Australia our people who would have been ill for or would be elderly and they are likely to have very limited savings and to have largely eroded those savings so $500 a month really means that it's unaffordable for most people who would want to use it and I can't see our current federal government or any of the state governments rushing up to subsidize that it's unlikely that that price would come down for many many years because the high price is covering a short patent period during which the company would want to recoup its very considerable costs of development it's also important to recognize that the older cannabis pharmaceuticals failed and they failed for reasons of their of the pharmacology of cannabis which is very unusual don't have time to go into that now but they really did fail that they they had very little penetration in the market I've already mentioned this about medicinal cannabis for epilepsy so move on now one of the things that's never talked about God knows why in this issue is the huge publication bias against medicinal cannabis it's not talked about by the supporters of medicinal cannabis or the opponents of medicinal cannabis but it's really one of the huge problems that we face when we're talking about this issue publication bias refers to the fact that in most countries research is seriously obstructed by major legal and funding obstacles hard hard to impossible to get funding likewise to get ethical approval and likewise to get the actual substance that you need to study so publication bias is really means that very little research gets done we have on the one hand a situation where research to identify the harms from recreational cannabis are generously funded and readily approved but the funds for but that approval for medicinal cannabis is the exact opposite and this republication bias is really a very powerful force in this whole debate never spoken about here's a quote from Shirley Simpson who was the spokeswoman for the National Institute on Drug Abuse an arm of the US government and it's for those who don't know this organization funds more than 80% of the illicit drugs research carried out in the world 80% of the illicit drugs research carried out in the world she said quoted in the New York Times in 2010 that the National Institute on Drug Abuse our focus is primarily on the negative consequences of marijuana use we generally do not fund research focused on the potential medicinal benefits beneficial effects of marijuana so then you have at a scientific organization that's carrying out a political mission despite that cannabis marijuana is now used medicinally in 23 under the 50 states of the United States of America plus the District of Columbia Washington but the US federal government despite that the US federal government still classifies marijuana as Schedule one and this means that firstly it's got considered to have a high potential for abuse secondly no currently accepted medical use in treatment and thirdly that it's unsafe even when medically supervised that's what schedule one means and this means that officially in the United States medicinal cannabis is considered to be more dangerous than cocaine which is in schedule two I mean it's laughable but this is the this is what we're dealing with now bad enough but US attitudes influence every other country in the world including this one so this publication bias is really quite a serious aspect of this comprar blaa miss bite this publication bias the sufficient research has somehow managed to get been done around the world of adequate quality in my view to justify allowing medicinal cannabis to be approved by regulatory bodies the number of midline index publications has doubled each decade for the last two decades 400 in 1990 and about 1600 midline publications in 2010 so there's quite a volume of research that now somehow still gets done finally policy must be based on published research not the putative results of research which hasn't yet been carried out because of this publication bias now we've also learned a lot about medicinal cannabis from studies of people who actually use the stuff regulated or not regulated including studies have been done in Australia and the main use that medicinal cannabis is put to is by people with severe chronic non-cancer pain things like arthritis significantly in JAMA the Journal of the American Medical Association a couple of months ago a study was reported showing that the opioid overdose death rates in US states that had medicinal cannabis was 25 percent lower than states that don't have medicinal cannabis and the longer a state had had medicinal cannabis the lower the death rate but that study so far hasn't been replicated it's only just come out no doubt other studies like this will be will soon be published but this is a very interesting study if you don't know about it do read about it pressure for more research on medicinal cannabis and for more use of medicinal cannabis is growing internationally about 20 countries now permit medicinal cannabis and there are many different regulatory models each of the 23 states plus Washington DC have got different ways of handling this and it's really very hard to work out what are the good and bad aspects of this and we're now also seeing the connection between this issue and the growing support at least in the United States for taxing and regulating recreational cannabis to States prove that as I'm sure you know in 2012 and two more in just last month in November plus Washington DC so some evidence some movement there and the research evidence continues to increase we're also seeing movement in international drug law reform somebody mentioned the global Commission on drug policy and that's had a huge effect since it was first launched in New York in June 2011 and there's no doubt that there is now a global movement for drug law reform we're seeing that particularly in South America and what's happened in New Zealand last year has been very encouraging but we should also remember and venj Allah remarked on this earlier that the Single Convention from 1961 which is really that the first international treaty there were treaties under the League of Nations but the first treaty under the UN system so over 40 over 50 years ago guaranteed not to have interfere with medical or scientific use never less if medicinal cannabis is accepted in Australia in other countries it will be seen as a form of drug law reform this very significant statement came out by William brownfield two months ago he's the most senior ranking US government official permitted to talk about officially about US government drug policy and here he is giving a press conference he's a figure in the US State Department and in the u.s. system drug policy Believe It or Not belongs in the State Department and in the Bureau of international narcotics and law enforcement Affairs of which William Brown field is the director and he's assistant secretary status which means he's one slot below John Kerry and here he is saying we must have enough flexibility talking about the international system to allow us to incorporate chain to practice to accept the fact that some countries will have very strict drug approaches other countries will legalize entire categories of drugs now here's the United States trying for over a century to develop a global system of drug prohibition and inflexible interpretation of the drug treaties was the mantra for all these decades now turning around in the last few months and saying no no what we need is a more flexible system so things aren't really starting to change you can argue about how much of a change William Brown fields had actually advocating but there's no doubt this is a significant development now my view all drug law reforms are connected to other drug law reforms it's it's a system it's a whole process it's a sequential process and I think the head of the queue is recreational cannabis and medicinal cannabis and they're at the head of the queue because medicinal cannabis is a very difficult issue for politicians not easy for them to say to suffering people know you can't have this drug even though a lot of senior doctors think you might benefit from it difficult issue for them and recreational cannabis is a growing issue for them also because of the growing support particularly in the United States but also in other countries for reform of recreational cannabis and then it's also important because the the market for cannabis accounts for a very large share of the the black market for illicit drugs in economic terms so there many reasons why they should be very mindful of cannabis a lot of their constituents smoke cannabis a lot of their constituents have smoked cannabis and of course it's a gateway drug if you want to become a u.s. president you almost have to have smoked cannabis and I think at the end of the queue are going to be the sort of drugs that that we've been talking about today they have a little public health impact used by relatively small number of people compared to say Cannabis demand is relatively small and not many people worry much about them but things will change as we see this sequential process start moving along what's the fundamental problem we're dealing with well we're basically trying to fit square pegs into round holes we've got three different kinds of forces that we're trying to reconcile we've got a system of international drug treaties three of them 1961 1971 1988 that 185 countries roughly around the world have signed on to including Australia including the United States including New Zealand we that's one issue second issue is the inexorable laws of economics that if there is strong enough demand some form of supply always emerges and the third issue is the unmovable mountain of politics and for many decades now bad policy has been wonderful politics that's now starting to break down but those three issues somehow have to be reconciled another issue that we have to remember is that under prohibition more dangerous drugs displace less dangerous drugs and we see many many examples of that around the world so-called iron law of prohibition and under reform I think it's fair enough to expect that that process will reverse some people think medicinal cannabis and drug law reform law generally is inevitable but I caution you from thinking that and here's a comment by a african-american abolitionist who devoted his life to the abolition of slavery and who said about powerful vested interests that power concedes nothing without a demand it never did and it never will and I think that's absolutely right if we want to see drug law reform we're going to have to fight for it now I've mentioned a few times this issue of whole plant cannabis versus pharmaceutical cannabis and pharmaceutical cannabis is really if nothing changes that's what we're going to get in Australia and there is logic for pharmaceuticals they're not completely irrational the logic is that after especially after the renascence the pharmaceutical drugs started replacing whole plants and for logical reasons the advantage was that you could identify and purify the active ingredient so you knew what was beneficial you could measure how much of that you were giving so you could give the same amount tomorrow as you gave yesterday and today and you could attribute the benefits and also the side-effects just to the most active ingredient so that was some really worked for many many drugs but cannabis is very unusual it's got an extraordinarily complicated pharmacology which very few people really understand especially among the busy politicians it's got many psychoactive ingredients and their interaction is only partly understood another aspect that I think changes everything a lot is that inhalation of cannabis vapor is now the least worst form of administration all the other forms are much more problematic smoking it's obviously problematic how can we seriously advocate for a medicine containing particulate matter to be inhaled into the lung it's offensive to most doctors including me to say that that's a medicine but now that we have a very excellent alternative better alternative in terms of inhalation of vapor I think that problem has overcome so what can I do sitting here in the audience about all this stuff well there's lots of things you can do you can write letters to the editor of newspapers metropolitan suburban rural remote short sharp letters just make one point well don't make six points badly you can ring up talkback radio you can engage busily in social media you can write or form delegations go and see you members of parliament federal level state level you can give talks at Apex and liens my advice to you is always trying to err on the side of understatement don't overstate the issues and of course you can also join the Australian drug law reform foundation and join unharmed and work through us so summarizing then medicinal cannabis is now available in 20 countries there's plenty of quality evidence for the effectiveness of medicinal cannabis and for its safety support for the status quo for medicinal cannabis is collapsing but there's not enough support yet for change the division among medical experts is a serious problem not sure how we're going to overcome that the the two private member's bills before Parliament's in Australia are now I'm a mentis development in this but there's still a long way to go what we used to say the fat lady hasn't yet got up to sing well the fat person I think we now would say hasn't got up to sing I think that's true this this isn't over till it's over so we've got a long way to go and I'm sorry for those of you who really want to see the into your genes get up but I think you're gonna have to wait a long time thank you very much [Applause] we do have a few minutes for questions if anybody like to come up and sing a couple at the audience I guess I can kick things off by maybe asking on your comments about the contention that cannabis may involve an altered state of consciousness as in many ways entheogens do but the other drugs that you listed on your list is further up the list for drug law reform for example amphetamines cocaine heroin tend not to involve altered states of consciousness which are uncontrollable by the by the state by the community by the mainstream do you have any thoughts about similarities and differences in that case between cannabis entheogens and i have to say that i suspect they're a broader interest than just antigens among the audience here but and then those other compounds which you regard as being further up the scale possibly because they represent a greater threat you know Public Health sense well from a medical perspective there has been a tradition developed over decades over longer than that really of regulating medicines and we make a lot of mistakes but the system is generally getting better still lower problems but it's generally getting better and now it's come down to two and a half criteria mechanisms is not one of them the criteria is it effective and is it safe and increasingly this is important in Australia not many other countries is it cost-effective that's why I say two and a half now mechanisms aren't a consideration because they're the one that they're the an aspect of this issue that is most arguable and sometimes we don't really understand what the mechanism for a drugs action is until after we've worked out that it is effective or that it isn't effective in any case we're quite happy our stock ders are very happy using medicines that we haven't got a clue how they work as long as they damn will work and are safe so now psychology is different and other disciplines are different so that's a different cultural perspective professional perspective and I think we could be arguing for a long time that cannabis does or doesn't work because it does or doesn't change states of consciousness but what I'm interested is did it help mrs. Smith I am just in regards to the best method of ingestion which you suggested was vaporization I'm a member of an online form of about 50,000 people called cannabis oil success stories where they're making a very strong very very strong extracted oil and taking it orally usually you know like a brace a fry size grain and having a lot of success on there in eliminating and reversing and slowing the growth of cancer I know it's a bit controversial but some of the mainstream sites seem to have a lot of the information on there about the cell death and things like that so I was just wondering if my questions about the best method of ingestion well cannabis is is very fat soluble and that means that it's oral absorption is problematic unless people unless it's presented in an oily fatty medium but it also means that in one of the uses for the drug where it is really very very useful that is dealing with people who who have not benefited from conventional medicines for dealing with their severe intractable nausea and vomiting post cancer chemotherapy you really the last thing you would want to do is to say to someone look I've got some fatty greasy stuff that you might want to just swallow to overcome your nausea and vomiting you can see a problem there so would you suggest vaporization but the people on with these theories they seem to think that wouldn't give enough concentration the other difficulties with oral absorption of cannabis is that it's very slow and that means that titrating to get the right dose so the person doesn't get too little so the symptoms aren't relieved or too much and they get unwanted intoxication and for all the people especially intoxication an unwanted side effect so that's another problem and the third problem is that the metabolism of swallowed cannabis is different from the metabolism of inhaled cannabis in the sense that there is an increased amount of stimulatory cannabinoids and a greater propensity to cause side effects so so there are a lot of problems with any orally administered cannabinoids and this is the reason why the the older pharmaceutical agents had no uptake by the market so then we've got smoking and then we've got inhalation of vapor now and the fourth method of course is spraying on the inside of the mouth which as the method used for Sativex now the advantage of inhalation is very quick absorption which means that for medicinal use that's perfect because the person can get the right dose they don't have too much they don't have too little the same saturation of the cannabinoids through vaporization well you get the patient gets the right dose has been a revolution in in pain relief those of you who have had an operation in the last five or ten years will probably have been given a little button to press so called PCA patient controlled analgesia and that's much better for patients patients overwhelmingly prefer to control their own pain relief and incidentally they get they have more comfort or less discomfort I should say and and they use less morphine then when the doctor prescribes it and the nurse dispenses of it injects it so we get much better outcomes if the patient controls their own dose and how much they use doesn't really matter the the what really matters that their symptoms are relieved and they don't have more than they wanted to have and they can do that with inhalation of the vapors so we've got very efficient affordable vaporizing equipment these days and we that's what we should be using and I'm sure that's what we will use increasingly thanks thanks I think in the interest of time we'll move on but thanks to Alex for sharing his expertise and knowledge [Applause] you"

qttwwsKNG5A,Australia to legalize medicinal cannabis in November,2016-10-05T08:52:25Z,
bY8D1bC-QrA,Peter Dunne on medicinal cannabis,2016-08-22T07:06:15Z,we wanted to talk to the justice minister Amy Adams about the broader issue of cannabis in New Zealand she declined and her office referred us to the associate Health Minister Peter Dutton now he didn't want to discuss the poll results he didn't want to discuss the laws because that's a justice issue not a health one but he was prepared to discuss the issue of why medicinal cannabis is so very hard to obtain in New Zealand and I began by suggesting that the current list of approved products which consists of one set of expiry comprehensive no I don't think it is but the reality is that unfortunately at the pharmaceutical-grade there's only about five products worldwide two of which are currently in testing one of which is approved sativex in New Zealand and the other two are available one in the Caribbean only in one in Germany only so it's not a satisfactory situation but part of the difficulty here is manufacturers don't want to produce products from trilemma New Zealand so how are they making this work in a place like California we're moving to the second tier which is a whole lot of what we would regard as non pharmaceutical grade medicines but the situation in New Zealand under the New Zealand law and it's been the case for a very long time and it applies to all medicines as where a medicine has not been approved through the normal process then doctors can prescribe that on application to the minister to approve that prescription but doesn't that put the ball in the doctor's court in other words they have to go to the Ministry and provide evidence of efficacy of the scientific basis for the likely success of the drug this is an enormous amount of work for the doctors not going to be better for the ministry simply to extend the list of approved products no if you were to just just put cannabis to one side for a moment in any other area you would expect a doctor to prescribe who was prescribing a medical product to be aware of its efficacy to be aware of as a toxicity to be aware of the dosage required and to know what it is they were prescribing cannabis is no different in that sense all medicines that are registered under the medicines Act have to go through a clinical trial process they are then signed off by mid safe I can't sign anything off just on a whim one product only in New Zealand has gone through that better sativex there is therefore the capacity which I just explained for long registered products non-pharmaceutical written sorry non registered pharmaceutical products to be approved on a case-by-case basis by the minister because there is no other regulation available for them and that that's that that's the reality Minister you gave a great speech it was acclaimed in New York and it was widely quoted and tweeted and everyone said well done Peter done and you talked about the need to be bold and I just wonder where your boldness is my boldness is but I am seeking solutions but John I'm not a pharmaceutical manufacturer I can't manufacture products I can't suddenly decide but this product is safe and therefore will make it available in New Zealand in a way that we would do for no other medicine what I can do and will do and am doing is encourage the medical profession because everyone says this is a medical issue I agree to become more aware to become more knowledgeable about what's available and to therefore seek to inform the discussion what are some fact happening at the moment is that most of them are running a mile from becoming involved because I see it as all too complicated that is not in the interest of their patients but I can't overrule him I'm not a doctor I don't seek to be a doctor and people keep telling me this is a miracle not a political issue I agree entirely okay what needs to happen Minister so that we don't have people who are terminally ill self-medicating why don't things I think two things need to happen firstly I think the clinical trial process is what I referred to earlier need to be completed there are prospects of some files getting underway in Australia at the end of this year but there probably 18 months to two years from completion there is one application I'm just not familiar with the detail for a trial being considered in New Zealand at the moment but beyond that nothing so that's the first tip that we need to make progress on the second step is I think for the medical profession to become much more actively involved in the advice that it's able to offer patients so that patients aren't put in a difficult position of literally having to go searching on the net for something that they think might suit their needs and then go to their doctor and say look I've discovered this product from wherever I think you put in a very difficult position I think they need to up school themselves rapidly okay so what if they do upskill themselves what are they able to do so I go to the baby okay I am terminally ill or my oncologist what is my oncologist able to do to provide me with medicinal cannabis for pain relief well the first thing your oncologist will have to do is to decide whether or not that's an appropriate treatment and if they do then what form and what product and then how it can be sourced that's not my job to determine that much I don't like that process take a look I can't tell you how long it would take a doctor to decide what a patient's condition is and what they need to have and get the appropriate approvals but we talk all I can say with regard to the approvals is the two cases that have come my way had been approved within the hour of arriving on my dear

0jmeZx5yFKc,Green hopes as Australia legalises medical cannabis,2016-05-22T07:33:54Z,smoking for cannabis law reform amidst the haze this is Australia's Mardi grass festival in the hippie town of nimbin while smoking marijuana is illegal police tolerate the event as well as games there's serious talk surrounding the use of medical marijuana including for sick children like Jo Whitelaw who has severe epilepsy the seizures are brutal he's been recessed we've performed CPR he's had a lot of brittle bones broken bones lots of our sight and that's just not from the seizures that's from the pharmaceutical medication Jai was on 35 tablets a day in a wheelchair nasogastric said at risk from prosecution she receives a cannabis extract produced by Tony Bower used by sufferers of epilepsy multiple sclerosis cancer and other illnesses the government always saying they're going to do something so people start researching heaven look and then they find me and you know I get stuck with them because the government won't do anything the mood is shifting in Australia in the state of Victoria children with epilepsy will be able to access the drug from next year but there is still debate on the side effects of medicinal cannabis with government reports highlighting concerns over mood swings and even links to schizophrenia companies looking to enter the market in anticipation of a relaxing of the law admit there still a stigma attached this thing is very important that we that we make the distinction between smoking where I wanted to get high and medicine for children or sick it's not something that you're ever going to get higher off you could drink the bottle of it beyond getting high Michelle wants legal protection fast for people across the country amnesty for the doctors to be able to speak up and say these are the results that this child is now getting from the cannabis temperatures so without that you know we're just waiting for that knock at the door with several Australian states getting on board with trials patients like Jai may soon be able to obtain cannabis extracts on the right side of the law
VJbuyah4V9Q,HUGE: $3 Million Received for Major Cannabis Research Center,2016-12-12T00:30:00Z,we've talked about this vicious circle of the need to legalize cannabis in order to end much of what's going on with the war on drugs some politicians say well in order to legalize it we need more research on it but the research itself is difficult to do because of the current legal status of cannabis so it creates this impossible circle that I think we generally understand we've got some really good news about this which is that Jefferson University announced that it has received a 3 million dollar donation from two Australian philanthropists Barry and joy Lambert to fund medical research into cannabis and they're actually going to be renaming the cannabis research center the Lambert Center for the Study of medicinal cannabis and hemp now there's some disagreement over the the reality of this Jefferson University says it's the quote first major health sciences university in the US to establish a medical cannabis research center however Ole Miss has had a cannabis research center for many years uh so it's unclear whether this is considered the first major or the first miner or whatever the case is but this is still really really big news and you know when I was at UMass Rachel I thought we had a cannabis research center it turns out it was just a frat house I was convinced that we had a major cannabis research out there uh okay so it in all seriousness now though uh we've gotta break the cycle right i mean the scheduling of cannabis as a schedule 1 drug at the at the national level the DEA getting the opportunity to change that saying that they are not going to uh we we need to be researching this in a more serious way and my concern is jeff Sessions incoming attorney general it's not exactly going to be the most welcoming environment for marijuana research is it yeah and schedule one means that it's the most dangerous possible drug there's no medical uses for it whatsoever and it's on the same same platform as things like heroin meth and LSD reservations I wonder if there's going to be a shift now from Israel which is kind of our unofficial offshore area for cannabis research yeah exactly i wonder if this is going to set actually a positive precedent to kind of shift research over here because as we know to get anything done through the FDA it takes about a lifetime yeah and that there's there's a broader question around the world which is what's wrong in the united states that it's taking so long to really start doing serious subsidized research on the benefits of both cannabis and hemp and when you think about pharmaceutical lobbyists tobacco lobbyist alcohol lobbyists the fact that count the count was government agencies and police departments around the country depend on up prosecuting and and going after cannabis in marijuana in the way that we do to fund themselves you've got the prison industrial complex which makes a ton of money from the status quo of marijuana if you follow the money Pat you usually figure out what's going on in not only in the United States but definitely in the United States yeah there's a lot of people in the pharmaceutical companies that would be poised to lose a lot of money if marijuana gain more traction in terms of medical uses last best last thing on this Rachel there's sometimes the thought from the anti legalization community that we don't have any actual medical evidence about medical uses for marijuana that could not be further from the truth there are over 100 different studies that at the small level have shown at minimum potential for medical marijuana used to treat a variety of conditions and symptoms if not actual success in doing so that's true but I really think the big underlying issue here is how the FDA is classifying it because if you think about all the research with the microbiome in classifying stool as a drug because who profits from stool yes that's a it's not a very profitable business I know Pat's looked into businesses involving stool and he ended up producing the David Pakman shows I think that tells you how much how much potential Pat's on that business I decided not to invest it is I have to invest i'm on twitter at the pakman you can also reach us on twitter at david pakman show will be back after this warby parker is offering a free five day home try-on to give you the opportunity to check out their glasses i personally wear warby parker glasses when I'm not wearing my contact lenses and I also started with one of these free at home try ons of five pairs of glasses you can get your free home try-on and support the david pakman show at Warby Parker try l.com / TDPS I don't really like going into glasses stores and trying on glasses while the salesperson sort of hovers over me and I like more than 30 seconds to actually figure out whether I like the glasses so with the Warby Parker home try-on I was able to pick five pairs that i liked put them on in the comfort of my own home pick the one I like the most and then Warby Parker put my prescription lenses in there for me a lot of people don't know that the eyeglass industry is controlled by just a few big corporations that keep prices very high like three hundred dollars for prescription glasses high which is just insane Warby Parker glasses start at $95 that's what mine cost and for every pair of glasses sold Warby Parker distributes a pair of glasses to someone in need you can try five pairs and see what you like check out the at-home trial and

i26Lf9bfeZs,Medical Cannabis question from Pauline Hanson during Question Time,2016-10-10T23:13:15Z,senator Hansen mr. president my question comes from BEC Britain our bedroom and goes through the Minister representing health senator Nash November sees Australia one step closer to the use of medical cannabis with the allocation of licenses for growing of medical grade cannabis the federal government has deemed the end product capable of treating ailments such as epilepsy pain management and cancer but more broadly this miracle oil or capsule from whole plant production is proving benefits to sufferers of Crohn's disease Parkinson's PTSD rheumatoid arthritis autism dementia Tourette's type 2 diabetics irritable bowel syndrome and the list goes on my question is why is the government allowing States if they choose to introduce medical cannabis to regulate the trials and patient groups on a state-by-state basis of this urgently needed life-saving drug the Minister for regional development representing the Minister for health senator nation thank you very much mr. president and I think Senator Hansen for her question and to quite obvious very sincere interest in this in this issue the reason why the states do the delivery of those trials mr. president is that it is the ability of the states and territories to do that so that is the appropriate mechanism for that to are through which that should be delivered what we have done mr. president and I think very responsibly as this government through the Minister for health and her leading work in this is now provide an opportunity for those people who need to be able to access medicinal cannabis for health purposes to be able to now obviously there needs to be a strict regulation a strict regulatory environment around that mr. president which this government has indeed put in place and what we're going to see is people now once these processes have been concluded is to be able to access medicinal cannabis which they weren't able to before and I do have tonight the the community drive to ensure that this was put in place it was not insignificant and from people right across many communities and I know that my colleagues here center via McDonald was one of them involved in the committee process that very much looked into in detail the benefits and how this would operate so I think we've got the balance right mr. president I think we've seen us now land at a point where we are going to be able to deliver something that it's going to provide health benefits but at the same time maintain that very strict regularly regulatory requirement that is needed to ensure the safe and safety and efficacy of the delivery of this medicine and in relation to the delivery through the states and territories that's the appropriate process Thank You mr. senator Hansen supplementary question senator Nash is a government aware that Queensland will tomorrow debate and vote on passing synthetic medical cannabis in lieu of whole plant cannabis that health workers claim will be detrimental to patient's well-being Minister no I'm not aware of that mr. president but I'm very happy to undertake to get a briefing for the senator from the minister's office Thank You minister Senta had some formal supplementary question senator Nash can you please give me an example of a controlled drug either on the PBS game or otherwise that is administered on a state-by-state basis and if not why doesn't the federal government take full control and make this a federally administered drug Minister mr. president I'm not aware of the level of detail that that's required in that question so again I'm very happy to take that on notice for the senator so that I can get her a fulsome answer in regard to that what I would say mr. president is that right across this country we have seen people very appreciative of the fact that this government has made some sensible measured decisions about being able to deliver medicinal cannabis cannabis for health purposes to support those people who need it who are in those circumstances where this has been deemed to be the most appropriate use of medication to assist those people that need to help I think
56H9Ueq3ASo,Real News Australia Street Beat - Cannabis,2016-05-22T07:23:42Z,"what were your thoughts on things like legalizing cannabis and medicinal cannabis stuff like that to be honest doesn't really phase me I mean it doesn't affect me then I like I don't have an issue with it like you you've got an issue with it don't do it yeah fair enough so you would say it's okay to legalize it would you reckon if should be fifth Parliament camera and said cannabis is now legally medicinal reasons yep I'm sure okay and again if you don't agree with it don't do it look like if your doctor prescribe you something that you don't want no one's forcing you to take it so don't see why it's an issue if know Roy's that's right thanks you're talking I appreciate you think should be legalized yeah yeah I think yeah definitely there should be yeah for sure and things like kids having seizures and stuff also thing yet what about in general as even decriminalizing it for example as just as a recreational user for example yeah because it's states in the u.s. sort of job done Italy yeah yeah kudos Thank You time I Jesse what are you thoughts are likely what do you thought something like legalization of cannabis and things like medicinal cannabis yeah be desta that's fine yeah yeah recreational it's fine as well yeah yessir your for things like you see there in the States and that's working for them over there it's working for Claude oh is that yeah yeah that's one of them this for actually yeah what states that have gone full legal I think Colorado is turning over I have no state debt now do you know Dave oh yeah that's right yeah I think it's fine you please look answer them that's what stuff is it legal throughout the whole country over there yeah yeah awesome okay what do you think about things like the trying to legalize it here decently do you think that's a good idea they should do i hear ya yeah why not yeah we've seen all the viral videos of you know kids being helped up by thinking you're having seizures all all day and stuff they'll help you or what are your thoughts on legalizing medicinal cannabis and you know in Australia or even in general that's all right yeah what are you reckon that what do you thought do you think it's a good thing or a bad thing for medicinal cannabis yeah good night yep yeah yeah have you seen videos online about you know like there's definitely leave my kids with harrowing seizures at 10,000 seizures a year I was something going to no seizures you know things like that have you seen things like that it all along haven't seen anything like that no it's plenty of them out there I can tell you now yeah Jerry from the states how much yeah medicinal cannabis is use their butt back pain and also yep yep there's there's four states that have actually completely legalized it all together over the Colorado obviously being one of them have you heard about that at all I think I have is that is that the one that's got a few problems over there controlling it no they're actually it's actually working wonders for them actually they've gone from having one of the only one of the few states there that actually have no debt whatsoever because they're making so much revenue from it from from selling at a tax that of course that's all controlled well that's one of the pros of in there rather than aground yeah exactly yeah so things like do criminalization yeah would you be on board with the least decriminalizing it yeah this feel which what are you stand on the issue of cannabis and using that like for missional purposes things like that yeah yeah because they think about their bringing the law now to sort of legalized medicinal cannabis in Queensland have you heard about that at all yeah i can get miss regulated and go ahead yeah cool correct yes right she's she's up on it but on what about illegal izing it in general into a country that's done it already say what's back there I don't really know much about me what about there's four states in the u.s. actually that have done it for last couple years now have you heard it is what Colorado being one of them have you heard of that at all I know what's happened but I haven't looked into how its effect primary okay or from all the things I've read it's actually it's rich brawl crime rates down there one of the few states that have no debt now they're actually making money as they have no no no state debts which is because it's all taxed of course through the government so you think that could be a bonus for things like Queensland well are people using it that's like a gateway drug like have they seen how it's affected other drug raids cuz that's the only other see okay so you could possibly lead to the hardest substances moving like it obviously apparently has lots of benefits but I've wanna see with the naked Yeah right excellent so you're right just get get more information on the topic yeah of course cool thanks to your time girls much breathing that's a good idea about legalizing medical cannabis in in Queensland anything that might help medicine yeah yeah yeah we can answer if cool or out about on in general a little legalizing it for a recreational use as well yeah what do you think I think it's a good idea or I think it's no good what do you thought I think in a medical situation yeah yeah generally not not too fond of it for everyday use maybe no that's alright so subjective isn't it yeah a little bit yourself every day you see or know I think that's a very subjective thing yeah happy really angle listen I'm not asking if you use it at all just wondering if you think it's a good idea if people want to do what I can or yeah that's cigarettes illegal uncle's little well yes kind of the points where yeah it's fine it is where people can have their choice yeah cool doesn't get too out of it but we're in a majority on the personal side of things here yeah cool it's it seems to be the consensus of everyone we've asked today that's yeah legalizing for medicinal purpose is definitely a good thing yeah yeah cool now thanks your tongue guys are really appreciate okay thanks I think these"
meDlQ7Qow-A,"Part 1: Dr David Caldicott, Australian Medicinal Cannabis Observatory",2016-06-09T06:54:30Z,I'm a very big friend of what you guys do up here of course I would say that everybody who comes here says that but no I think either I am and I'm going to introduce something a new player and in the game of medicinal cannabis this is Australian medicinal cannabis Observatory so that's me that's our little logo which some of you will recognize I have some letters I work actually in the environment of the emergency department out of the Australian National University and the University of Canberra and one of the reasons I like coming up here is because I like to mingle dangerous folk and certainly within my realm you guys are terribly dangerous people use drugs and [ __ ] so all of my friends back home are sort of like oh my god you're going to be sort of you know revolutionary by the time you come home I guess it probably takes one to know one I've been particularly by this mob in New South Wales that the cannabis initiative or whoever I've been described is very dangerous because of my what I regard has fairly mainstream ideas but well they regard us as fairly radical so I'm in fact far more dangerous than you are in the first instance and it's actually converted into a family thing so if any of you are cops and you have me killed this evening I've got another one to stand in place back home so I've always been attracted to dangerous folk from all sorts of backgrounds and I guess the reason being is because they lead thoughts on things the most dangerous people they're always clever they're compelling in their charismatic and that's why I like coming here because you're unduly represented in your dangerousness if this was the definition I myself don't regard myself as particularly dangerous I regard myself as a rather disruptive that used to be a bad word I was very disruptive in school and now all of a sudden I discover it's a good thing to be ma'am so what I like to think that we do is disrupt with a sort of normal paradigms of how we approach drugs and I guess I should probably talk to you about how this idea of an Australian medicinal cannabis observer observatory came about and what better place to start than at the very beginning obviously all of this starts with an Irishman everything starts with an Irishman William Brooke of Shaughnessy is the gentleman who translated a lot of what we know from the sort of cultural use of cannabis from a medicinal perspective in India into a palatable form for the medical profession back home and he was quite the Renaissance man involved in a whole bunch of different things like myself and and so I have a natural affinity for him the was said to have treated Queen Victoria's dysmenorrhea with a tincture of cannabis but I've not been able to find any evidence for that whatsoever anywhere with regards to the beginnings of our particular voyage I guess it starts with this young man a young man called Dan Haslam who I never had the pleasure to meet I spoke on the phone several times him and we chatted about what he thought was important and and what should be done in Australia and then I have almost weekly been harassed and intimidated and scared by his mom a lady called Lucy Haslam who is one of the most fearsome creatures I have ever had the pleasure of knowing and I just do what she says because I'm scared of doing otherwise our beliefs and where we're coming from as far as the the observatory is concerned are very straightforward and I hope that they're similar to your own they start with the fact that our approach to medicinal cannabis over the last century has been fact just factually incorrect it's just been wrong and it that's for a whole bunch of different reasons we could our G bar G about but it's been incorrect we're now overdue for that correction and in the course of correcting that those lack of facts we probably need to separate recreational and medicinal cannabis there are opponents to a regulated medicinal cannabis market from both sides of the debate so from people who don't think it should be there in the first place and from people who actually don't it should be regulated I'm in the middle between the two we oppose virulent ly big green so the idea of people making a great deal of profit out of other people's suffering and very strongly support the concept of people or as I'm a doctor patients before profits and will commit or collaborate with anyone who is committed to this concept of open science so that the science is done not for the purposes of supporting profit not for the purposes of pouring big pharma but for the purposes of getting knowledge that other people can use and so the question we always ask with all of the work that we do in the observatory is does everything we do pass the test what test is that well we call it Dan's test but it could be any any of your kids tests it could be anybody who is using medicinal cannabis in any circumstance is what we are doing likely to benefit someone who was in Dan's position I don't know if you know the story of Dan hasn't done died from from cancer very tragically very tragically early and and he found great relief from using cannabis and if if what is being done isn't actually benefiting a patient directly then it's not good enough for us so I'm here to tell you about something new another dangerous idea I did attend to turn the mash and I like to think of it as a very dangerous idea because it's been done in conjunction with a lot of people from the cannabis consuming community because that's where the knowledge is in Australia it's not with me yeah it's with you lot and that's our that's our Australian medicinal cannabis Observatory logo soon to be on t-shirts everywhere and and available at no price whatsoever we established this two years ago in the knowledge that medicinal cannabis was in fact going to be an inevitability in Australia there was absolutely no way that it wasn't going to take off particularly with Lucy Haslam harassing politicians about it we also did a recognizing that there was absolutely no preparation for medical cannabis market and no infrastructure to support it and in Canberra we're in a very good position to negotiate and discuss policy with key players and so this is where we've been working from the we've kind of decided deliberately to avoid the clinical trial space it's very messy it's very controversial it is firmly ensconced and embedded and intertwined with big pharmacy and we don't like that so we've left that to other people who are perhaps more comfortable sleeping with those bedfellows and so our goals within this Observatory is to engage Australian consumers and to learn from their experiences so this is very much a feedback and to try to incorporate your knowledge into medical knowledge for a greater benefit for an Australian population we want to create a safe and trusted registry of users so this is a registry that is not available to pharmaceutical companies not of not a commercial registry or something much more like the Australian household survey which is held in the a in News Australian data archive and is encrypted to all be Jesus and is only available to those people who are conducting the research we're very interested in facilitating the receipt analysis and feedback of the contents of the samples this is a much broader ambition than the pelican study I mean obviously imitation is tremendously flattering our ambition is substantially greater than merely one subsection of the population we are able to do this now and I'll show you how that happens and finally to provide an independent Australian education program for people who can administer the medicinal form of cannabis it has to be independent because if you have big pharmacy involved in the education process they're going to clearly educate prescribers about the benefits of prescribing their product so it really needs to be independent and academic so to that end a survey heard about surveys and once again I'm flattered that the Lambert initiative was able to put together a survey in such short notice ours was designed over the last 18 months and we deliberately chose today to launch it because we think you are very important and it's from your group of people that we want to hear it's for the consumer involving the consumer and it's by the consumer the questions that are on it are questions that have been suggested to us by you and we are just brokering it it is not market research I'll repeat that it is not market research there are many surveys available in Australia ours is not market research and it's reiterative so we'll be coming back to you again and talking to you again about what the implications of the answers you've given us this survey will serve to inform our registry and we're very lucky in that tone dr. Tony McCoy actually professor Tony McCoy the previous Dean of Social Sciences is one of our key collaborators I'd emphasize that all of the people who were involved in this research in the observatory I provide their services pro bono we are not paying any of our researchers for what they do which keeps them honest it's independent of industry and it's an opportunity for consultation we firmly believe in open science there are no confidentiality clauses in when we sign up our collaborators we believe that de-identified the data should be available to any researcher we think that a monopoly in research in Australia is a very foolish idea because it is monopolies like all monopolies are open to abuse what is useful about the collaboration in the ANU is that we have the ability to tie the survey and the data from the survey to an analytical process so if you are using a substance and this is like NYX pelican study but much broader in scope it's not just pediatric epilepsy it's anything if there is something that you're using medicinal cannabis for we can test your product and tell you what's in it and we will be happy to do so we have the very best of analytical expertise in the country based out of the research school of chemistry at the ANU and there is no better group of forensic chemists in Australia or any little chemists so you will have the opportunity submit your medical samples for whatever condition that you're using for analysis and that will help us sort out the wheat from the chaff in terms of providing our research colleagues in the clinical world information about what is active and what is not we're very determined that we should have an Australian education system for an Australian provider there are many education systems out there we are quite restricted you will all understand this in Australia about what we can use cannabis for at the moment next to nothing what we will be able to use it for initially still next to nothing but I see that as moving forward and developing but we need to have we aren't going to be able to import an American system for example of Education into Australia and have that palatable for for the people who are going to be passing laws I think the other thing is is that the experience of medical cannabis in Australia is substantially different to those other countries elsewhere that are introducing it and so austerity actually deserves to have its own education system the idea is that this would be both APRA the association of healthcare professionals their registry and a medical college it would be online and updated and current updated with the help of people who are in this room at the moment people who will know a great deal more about developments in the field and people like myself two modules or two types of modules involved a basic module and clinical modules the basic modules include social history of medicinal cannabis in Australia a review the end the cannabinoid system a review of the cannabis plant the pharmacology of cannabis and cannabinoids and delivery and dosage of cannabis medicine the last one perhaps being the most challenging for medical practitioners or a poor registered practitioners in Australia many of the people in this room know great deal about all of this the problem is is that many medical folks don't and this gives them the opportunity to be reassured that it's going to be okay there is a corpus of knowledge out there which is available to them should they want to learn about it you got to understand that in Australia there will be clinicians who will not be interested in getting involved in this because it's naughty and dangerous and that's fine they shouldn't be forced to but for those who want to be involved in this they're going to feel greatly reassured if there's something that's endorsed not only by their registration body but also by the colleges that train them the first element will be open to everybody because I think's really important that the general public understands that in fact the business of medicinal cannabis and where we've got to now is a farce it's something that should never been arrived at and the only by exposing how we got to that position will be be able to reassure the people in the middle the general public who have no interest in its use but who may actually end up opposing this because they don't know enough about it the clinical modules are limited to start with because we think that this is where we are going to get buy-in in in terms of the colleges as an opera this allows us in the meantime to develop system data which will permit us to design and deliver wider subjects and pathologies and I think that this is only the beginning so we're talking about cancer and palliative care seizure severe intractable seizure disorders and refractory pain and I think it's far more important to get something on the board than it is to get everything on the board we've seen the fact what happened in California where the Californians introduced legislation that was very broad indeed and in in fact what they successfully did was inoculate their population against that legislation so what we need to see is a narrow introduction for education with a view to opening it up as as soon and as quickly as people who are as nerdy as me are reassured that it's safe obviously it's important that we acknowledge that there are cannabis use disorders and there are special groups of users like what about pregnancy what about young people there will be an entire section on that these are dangerous times right now in this field for a number of different reasons I think the biggest reason why we are at a hazardous point is because of the sheer amount of money that's involved there are people out there who want a bit of that buck you are wearing your beautiful women wearing a chastity belt to which you only have the key and you are potentially about to hand over the key to people who could end up being Big Pharma and take you for everything that you've got it's the only thing that you have is this knowledge and I would say to you be very careful about who you decide to collaborate with in this space there are a lot of people who are claiming to be on your side at the moment I don't know if you've been approached as a community I know I certainly know that there are in all of the various meetings that we go to at camera and at state level there are increasing numbers of people from the big end of town who want a bite of this market and I would be very cautious about who you get into bed with there are challenges ahead and I just sort of I don't want to interfere with the Kombi parade so I'm just going to sort of push on through these and I see these largely in the spaces of opposition to medical cannabis although I think that's actually beginning to wane in Australia perhaps one of the greatest ones is exploitation of the field at the moment impatience and she will talk about and legislation there are three main groups of opponents and one which is beginning to rear its head those who who actually just don't know anything about it they haven't read the literature they're confused about the differences between recreational and medicinal cannabis and that's simple that's simply a matter of educating them of informing them and doing so gently there are those who have a moral or political problem with druggies so you know moral problem they think that it's wrong or it's not see a political problem it's gonna lose them votes I think a lot of politicians have put not so much a moral opposition to medicinal cannabis or any form of cannabis use they have more of a political problem because they don't know how to sell it to their their constituents and I think once again we can help them with that they perhaps don't understand or realize the extent of support that there is for this in the community and it's very much our job to to help them point that out to them I think one sinister group that I have a real problem with and I'm not prepared to forgive are those who are involved with companies that make opiates or other analgesics and we've seen quite clearly that some of the strongest opponents to medicinal cannabis in America are in fact on the boards of all of these companies that's what I call and what the medical profession calls a conflict of interest and that is one of the big problems with the medical profession in Australia I think that there are certainly clinicians in Australia who are conflicted in this way but since in the last six months I would also say that I've identified a further group which is very disappointing but it's real and though that is people from our own ranks in our own space who are in fact participating frequently covertly or in a cult fashion with big pharma and they for example are people who would block the use of botanical products or try to pitch synthetic products that could be marketed at much higher value and I think we've seen a lot of that in Australia in the last six months particularly there are great researchers in Australia people who I have in the past admired tremendously and they've turned and they've turned bad and they have become avaricious and they have sold their souls not in a way that is publicly known but certainly in a way that is known when you get down to regulation when you get down to the meetings when we see for example in New South Wales so when you run a pharmaceutical trial it's largely the pharmaceutical company that pays for the trial and yet New South Wales at the moment there's a trial ongoing that is being paid for by New South Wales so a pharmaceutical company is pay is being paid by New South Wales to run a trial which has been brokered by scientific colleagues this is completely immoral and nobody knows that that's a conflict of interest if you try publishing that trial in any major journal and not get lambasted for because you're conflicted you sold your soul I don't know I saw her I didn't catch her eye if she was here last year I don't for any of you who are interested if you've seen this this graphic novel of weed woman it's brilliant I love it and the idea it's an allegory it's kind of like Paul Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress for the evolution of the of the cannabis market in general but she has got her finger on the pulse see warns us of the shape of things to come and and the shape of things to come is this the the pbps the people or the prophets before people I love the graphically I think they're stunning they remind me of the the nasty little boy in Sin City who carves up people and you know morally I think they're identical she describes them as people who came and presented themselves as friends their darkness grew so powerful it brought others and then that darkness began to spread this is happening this is happening right now and I don't mean to put it down or on any of this because this is also a time of great excitement but this is so obvious to people outside Australia that in fact there's only one country that's actually earned a graphic PBP there's your Australian PBP this is what the rest of the world is seeing as what is happening in the evolution of this market so be careful if you're not aware of this please look into what's going on so how do we identify people who might want to exploit what is your knowledge and what is the science the question you need to ask yourselves is cui bono which is Latin for who stands to gain this is from Sisera one of the greatest legislators in the history of debate in an interrogation who stands to gain how do we find out who stands to gain from this sort of research is the sole purpose of this research to make money who's making that money and how are they making it is there a commitment open science or people getting signed up to confidentially confidentiality clauses left right and center what are they promising and when will they deliver what conditions do they demand of you and what sort of conflicts of interest are involved if any of these ring a bell these are people who you should think long and hard about collaborating with I'm not one to white and other people's research I am just warning you that this is out there and if you look at the way for example how the alcohol lobby has free rein in this country that is also how the cannabis Lobby unless it's it's policed by the group of consumers themselves unless you guys take control of this this is what's going to happen here as well so what to do what do you when you protect yourself what's pretty straightforward really because you guys hold all the cards without your involvement then there is no research there's no collaboration there's nothing that Big Pharma can do without you determining the and you can take your ball and you can leave the playground so it doesn't matter how fancy it doesn't matter how sharp if you feel that you're being exploited in any way you probably are and the information that's being generated from either this whatever you're you're giving either data or for example Jeanette germline that is going to end up with the till raised and the GWS is of the world rather than in the hands of an Australian industry so what challenges are we faced with the first I allude to is impatience and I get that there's great impatience among consumers for myself included I think a lot of this is already sold I think a lot of the information is done we're ready to go ahead and yet again and again and again you find yourselves with blockades to your progress and and that's often not sinister it's more hesitancy from people of my professional background the hesitancy of nervous collaborators and to both sides of this divide I say just in the same way as I my kids do when they see Cinderella have courage and be kind be gentle with each other while you negotiate this difficult period because there's no point in making enemies there's a lot of people from both sides of that fence who are working towards a similar goal and I say try to do it together try not to drive your own agenda or I'll try not to drive mine there have been huge bounds in legislation today largely driven by the consuming community it certainly wasn't initiated by politicians that's for sure it's the consuming community who has driven this agenda in Australia and the farm to pharmacy is well underway forever see the patient not so much and you know I suspect they're probably waiting for something as fancy as farm to pharmacy for to develop but yeah there's a real hold up and actually getting from growing a product to getting it into a patient and so we're working hard on that I would argue that there is no real compassionate access scheme in place in Australia there are a lot that are once again marketed or portrayed as such but I think those portrayals are flawed if you look at say for example the tick's system I think for starters the nomenclature sucks you know compassionate access has got to be more than just for terminal illness there's very limited eligibilities it's under the rubric of justice and not health which is just dim and it's also dependent upon police discretion the quantities that are allowable clearly confound recreational medicinal requirements and once again behind closed doors I have heard researchers in this field argue against a decent compassionate access system because it could interfere with their trials I don't care that's the whole point of a compassionate access system is that it's compassionate work your way around that buddy it is not up to the general population to facilitate your research there are issues of driving which I think are reasonably easy solved so I might just know if I can work this I'm going to show you a little clip just maybe to remind us of what this is really about
nC83Vnn5vCg,Medical Marijuana Might Be Legalized In Australia Really Soon - Newsy,2016-02-10T16:39:55Z,Australia might legalize medical marijuana the government introduced legislation of Parliament that would legalize growing pot for medical or scientific reasons the bill amends an old narcotics act from the 60s according to ABC this bill would allow for cultivation through a national licensing and permit scheme back in October a bill is passed to allow marijuana research and growth as long as there was government oversight and in late January a cannabis based drug aimed at treating children with epilepsy was allowed to begin trials this past October the state of Victoria legalized non-smoker bow medical marijuana and will likely be the first in Australia to legalize cannabis even if this new Medical Marijuana Act passes states there can decide if they will comply a report from Australia's Parliamentary Budget Office found of recreational and medical marijuana and hemp production were legalized by 2017 it could mean a sizable chunk of tax revenue in the following two years about 460 million u.s. dollars for newsy I'm Melissa prax
xwsgFgLvaWw,&#39;Medical Cannabis Legalized in Australia&#39; - A Voluntaryist perspective,2016-02-10T07:37:33Z,"hello this is travis of information warfare I want to make a video about a drug war and cannabis legalization medicinal legalization and then recreational legalization I just wanted to bring forward some news on that and also some important things to keep in mind most of you are probably aware that areas in America Colorado and some other places have actually fully legalized cannabis for recreational and medicinal use and I guess nutritional as well and there are also a number more places in America that have legalized for medical reasons now Australia has actually moved into doing that in terms of the medical use so this is a great development because you know I'm gonna be honest and happy notice before about Australia there is a lot of [ __ ] laws here there are a lot of nanny state regulations and this medical legalization you know it's still fairly nanny state because they're trying to trying to really limit it to only a certain few people but you know this is still a good development sales you know reading our blog articles about it they're doing the CBD which is the cannabidiol which is a particular kind of annoyed of the cannabis plant they were pretty much trying to not get people to have THC which is the psychoactive compound or one of them you know reading this article here the kind of you know just pissed me off a little bit the way they worded it and I had to make this video you know had some valid points but um they were saying I feel for parents that have sick children so I want to make that I want to make this available to them so they don't have to get it illegally and then they said suddenly when we are talking about children as the patient's we do not want charlatans exploiting desperate parents for large sums of money for a treatment that is still against the law and has no guarantee and no one can complain if it went horribly wrong for legal reasons now the fact that they would call someone supplying a medicine to someone even though they themselves for supplying that could be put in jail the fact they would call them charlatans that this seconds me because this government thinks they can just make this illegal and threaten all these are while people for usage of a plant and extracts of this plan and then they can just come along and say okay we care about the children we don't want the show of like like like the people that are supplying it are the charlatans okay get off your [ __ ] high horse me the drug war in its entirety is immoral and wrong because we're all humans or people on this planet and then these people make these laws against non violent actions such as drug use manufacturing selling whatever doesn't matter what you're doing if it's voluntary it's a non-violent action I'm just sick of the misrepresentation so you know it's great that they're doing this medical thing it's awesome to step in the right direction but you know they need to stop acting like because they stopped using violence in a minut area that they are this slate awesome thing okay stop the violence stop the threats of violence how many people have been caged because of this a lot a lot of people the drug war is a crime against humanity the drug war is [ __ ] it's just people saying you can't use this substances people making claim over your body and your consciousness it's just part of the Terrorism of government it's one of the excuses they made to put their hands on you they just wrote words on paper and then they made claim over you and then people don't question that so they think it's legitimate that this group has the right to make claim over your body and consciousness but if any the group did it it's crazy it's all crazy okay so let's just get that out the way I just need to get off my chest so let's talk a little bit about this medical cannabis Lee aren't necessarily legalizing cannabis but they're legalizing drugs made from extracts of cannabis so I had to be the pharmaceutical industry that would find a way to make a drug before it would be legal iron a problem with like drugs made from things but it's just the fact that they're limiting people access to the natural client like it's a plant people need to stop being afraid of a plant people need to stop supporting groups of people calling themselves government using violence and threats of violence against people who want to use a plant or want to supply a plant to someone okay you wouldn't react that way to lettuce you wouldn't react that way to carrots or parsley Oregon Oh or avocados or tomatoes or whatever as you know in Australia and this isn't the case in most other places in the world but in Australia legally you can't eat hemp seeds or hemp protein like you don't even get high from them this is the level of insanity so I need to not only end the drug war but what food war or some [ __ ] like come on these hemp seeds that the first thing that big shell is cracked open so it's just the hemp hots right this is apparently a lead with its human Australia you can't even grow the plant from that firstly secondly you don't get high from it totally they're really healthy you know they have a good fatty acids and other nutrients as well fiber etc so we need to get over the hypocrisy you know chia seeds on illegal flax seeds on illegal hemp seeds sesame seeds on illegal pumpkin seeds on illegal hemp seed does ridiculous hypocrisy and what you can't get the the park for juicing is that what I'm getting from this that they just want to make a particular drug based on cannabis to be legal this needs to be fully legalized absolutely fully legalized one hundred percent for growing for selling for consumption medicinally all recreationally or nutritionally absolutely no human has the right to stop any human from using this plant now they don't have the right but they have the power and just because you have the power does not make it right just because they can use this violence against people doesn't make it right just because so many people have been thrown in jail doesn't make it right people seem because they're not even thinking like that really they're not thinking that just because they using quantum force that it makes it okay but that they just kind of don't question it all the thinking well if they're using that kind of violence if they got SWAT teams breaking down people's doors you know must be a good reason that's the kind of thing I imagine is going through a state of mind when they support the drug war or support other legislation against non violent actions so I'm just here to inform people that were all equal in our rights our rights are inherent they are naturally occurring that I come from government government seems to just violate them and we use overwhelming power but it doesn't have the right so when you have a few more articles so the federal government to legalize growing for medicinal use nationwide scheme so it's good that this is federally done okay now i am against government in general and if someone right in front of me can't rightfully control my body unconsciousness why is it someone 100 kilometers away or a thousand kilometers away or 10,000 kilometers away or any distance away can have any more of a legitimate claim they do not it's very important to understand some people might say oh you know you just selfish you just want to break laws when it's convenient for you yeah I do want to [ __ ] break laws when it's convenient for me because who the hell has the right to make laws against this who has they want to make laws that are convenient for them that's what you need to understand it's not a human right to make a law against a non-violent action which requires threats of violence and use of violence against a non-violent person to enforce when we have a look through this article here so this is um health minister Susan Leigh and I quote I've heard stories of patients who have resorted to a legal methods for obtaining cannabis and I felt for them because with a terminal condition the most important thing is quality of life and relief of pain you know and like that's that's all well and good you know no respect hove saying that because you know other politician before that really wants saying that so you know thumbs up to that but we just need to have the holistic view that is a right for all humans to participate in a non-violent voluntary action okay and I'll continue and we know that many people are calling out for medical cannabis it is important therefore that we recognize those calls for health and then we put in place what we know will support a safe legal and sustainable supply up a product the government intends to amend the narcotic drugs act to allow cannabis to go in for medicine and science and to ensure that Australia is not in rental in breach of international drug trades well [ __ ] international drug treaties [ __ ] international drug trainees okay I'm a person right but these other people far away from me have written words on paper saying that if local governments don't use one month's against non-violent people this is what wrong this is the violating a treaty [ __ ] your treaty this is ridiculous step in the right direction but ridiculous still miss Leigh said the legislation was only about medicinal cannabis not recreational use there is this is not a debate about the legalization of cannabis she says this is not about drugs this is not a product you smoke this has no thing to do with that okay you see I understand like that you're going to push for the medical thing and that's a scrape yeah you just got to realize that you don't have a right to actually control other people when they are in a non-violent voluntary Association so i hope i hope this is how a little bit you don't understand you know you know it's great that they're doing this medical cannabis thing but it's not the end because the whole drug was immoral these pharmaceutical companies are trying to actually take hold of it now I don't agree with that in the slightest shouldn't be able opoly on this this is a plant that naturally occurs thanks for listening please comment subscribe like share the video check out the other videos you know you need to actually um if you're not aware what I was talking about that we all have inherent human rights look up voluntary ISM or volunteerism it's all about voluntary interactions and the voluntary association is a preferable method of interaction then viola coercion or all people we have the same inherent natural rights let's start talking about that let's look at the world through that lens let us judge these so-called governments just people calling themselves that and their words on paper they call legislation let's judge them through the lens of volunteerism so we can see the evil thanks for listening"

BMCl8Gq9IEw,Mom treats epileptic daughter with cannabis oil,2016-04-26T00:52:52Z,where are you going Maya she's on the move it's a not so typical morning in the Wilkinson household mom Sarah is busy taking something out of the oven more on that later while the journalist plays with her daughter maíam turns the 10 year old with a beautiful smile and sadly an ugly rare debilitating disease you're figuring that how do you smile for the camera say hi to look at her now it's hard to imagine what they've both been through right from the time she was born it's mighty girl these are some of the earliest that you really took I guess yeah she was maybe four or five in those early years it was hard for Sarah to take many pictures of little Maya from the moment she was delivered and rushed to pediatric intensive care she knew something was drastically wrong I was talking to the nurse and the nurse said let me take her she took her to look at her put her down and she had a seizure and that was she was 29 minutes old an EEG confirmed the worst a suppression burst pattern indicative of a rare form of epilepsy known as Oda Hera this must have come as one heck of a shock I was devastated um her neurologist at the time in Ontario had us down and um my husband I were sitting on couches and he gave us a diagnosis and it didn't mean anything to me the name so I asked him you know what is her prognosis and he said you'll be lucky if you get to take her home but she did make it home and what came next was months and indeed years of adjusting medications trying to find something to slow down the constant seizures her seizures were probably once every five minutes or so she would have hundreds a day so basically what she was doing was sleeping and seizing how severe were they they were pretty like her her oxygen would dip sometimes it would dip to the 30s she would turn blue she you know must have been frightening into death it was horrifying it was absolutely horrifying the family rallied her husband the boys both healthy gladly took on the task of caring for their little sister and others helped to online she could find comfort and ideas from families in similar circumstances Samantha Cameron the wife of British Prime Minister David Cameron was part of her support group for a time their little boy Ivan was also born with old ihara it was comforting to find support I don't know how I would have gotten through those early days without them you know family is important but nobody knows what you go through those people do but one-by-one the drugs were failing or causing more problems than they fixed you thought you were losing her that's what the iron neurologist said sometimes there's just nothing left for us to do we brought her home I told my boys that was the absolute hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life so you know we just kind of prepared and it talked and you know what we wanted to do and how we wanted things to go and sure if we wanted her cremated or awful conversations no parent should ever a last desperate chance to save her daughter brought her online where other parents were talking about the wonders of cannabis oil Sarah decided she had nothing to lose there were no children with OTO Hara at the time who had tried it so she was the first and how soon before you sell risk immediately immediately we saw her like that day seizures just weren't there she wasn't seizing she obtained a prescription for medical marijuana that's what she was taking out of the oven which she turns into cannabis oil for Maya I'm just putting in 250 mils of coconut oil she has developed a process to extract the oil to get a one-to-one ratio of THC to CBD the active ingredients in marijuana that have changed her daughter's life the whole family's life really it means that we all can breathe I guess a little bit we've always felt like you know we're just holding our breath waiting you know it's it's just so much different we can do things as a family my sixteen year old can watch her you know no issue I don't have to worry about a major medical emergency you know I'm having like nursing stuff here after six months they performed another EEG at SickKids and were astounded by the results he said that it was completely normal and actually he said miracles happen any email and indeed he did so when her doctor wrote not a month later to say due to the strict nature of the policy implemented here at children I am not allowed to fill the forms for renewal of medical marijuana I apologize for the inconvenience this may cause she was stunned she decided to go public a website a powerful video and media interviews a lot of people said that I was stupid even friends family told me just shut my mouth I'm basically inviting the police and social services to my door but I thought well you can come because nothing else has ever worked and if she stops his treatment she'll die so it wasn't really an option I wasn't gonna stop treatment that was just not even an option for me the event if it turns you into it absolutely I would have gone to jail I mean I think any one of us would die for our children going to jail is a walk in the park compared to that so and and you know watching her like she used to be it's just something that I'll never do again as luck would have it a doctor at a clinic in Ontario heard of her plight and helped to require a prescription even so Alberta Health which oversees the Children's Hospital still says it does not support the prescription of medical marijuana for pediatric patients with epilepsy and health Canada's website is even broader dried marijuana is not an approved drug or medicine in Canada but but the courts have required reasonable access to a legal source of marijuana when authorized by a healthcare practitioner I have a name for it but what is it well its bureaucratic oh [ __ ] it is what do you say to the people that say but you're giving drugs to your daughter and I have run into a few of those people and the drug is that she was on before ketamine is a horse tranquilizer I mean when she's getting codeine and morphine for pain and you know all you know three different benzodiazepines and I'm throwing up her [ __ ] to it and you know kind of mean when she's in hospital or propofol which is what Michael Jackson overdosed on I mean it's just look at those drugs and you know tell him to go smoke a joint and then you know go take any one of the pills so she you know was on and just one of them and she was in combinations of you know six or seven so it's just it's a no-brainer and every day she hears from at least one parent and there have been hundreds looking for help for their child it's a political game but there are our people's lives that are at stake because of this and that sounds so cliche but there really is the only medication little Maya now takes open is cannabis oil twice a day good job she has not had a seizure in over two years the difference her mom says is like the difference between night goodnight baby girl and day you ready 1 2 3 oh we go Sarah doesn't know what the future will bring what new challenges and she knows there still needs to be more clinical evidence to convince some people but no one can tell her that Medical Marijuana hasn't changed her daughter's indeed her whole family's life just look at that smile red sharon cbc news and archery Alberta
8ampIns0oRk,1st Australian State Legalises Medical Cannabis,2016-05-04T23:11:11Z,in April Victoria became the first Australian state to establish a framework for legal medical cannabis the new laws first introduced in October then passed unanimously last month specify how medical weed will be grown processed distributed and sold the patient's Victoria's premier Daniel Andrews made the announcement April 12 fulfilling one of his election promises the government plans to start cannabis production soon with some patients beginning to receive access as early as 2017 according to help minister jill hennessy children with severe epilepsy will be prioritized before the program is expanded to other conditions under the new laws patients will require a doctor's prescription to buy cannabis the bill also allows for people to apply for licenses to produce medical cannabis and weed based products including oils tinctures and pills the bill comes just two months after Australia's federal government open the doors to legal medical cannabis nationwide or specifically states now the freedom to legalize medical cannabis or keep it banned at the recent United Nations special session on drugs a member of the Australian delegation described the country's new policy Australia's narcotic drugs amendment bill 2016 ensures our compliance with the 1961 UN Single Convention on drugs while enabling a sustainable supply of cannabis based medical products for Australian patients this legislation will facilitate more clinical trials and contribute to our knowledge of the risks and benefits of these medicines unfortunately like in the US while Australian states can choose to legalize medical cannabis others can leave it prohibited this means that while some Australians will have full access to the plant others will continue to be arrested and jailed for its use
Zo51GUZE-Jo,Cannabis Information Australia Interview (The Weed Journals),2016-12-16T13:31:48Z,law enforcement has been known to seize property and impound vehicles under the proceeds of crime act rendering the patient's medicine --less we're going to be talking to an a representative from cannabis information Australia she's agreed to be interviewed to discuss the plants medicinal qualities and you said it's legalized in how many states in the u.s. 20 and current legislation and law reform is that looking at changing right now some of the tinctures I believe have been known to cure seizures and the results have been overwhelming I believe it's been named as a wonder drug for epilepsy and would you agree that some of the addiction side of pharmaceuticals is the adverse reactions if not dramatically worse right even if the main component the CBD is the only form of use and anxiety and depression return amazing results is there any trials [Music] [Music] I believe through education people will understand the remarkable benefits of this plant and if somebody that's living in chronic pain day in and day out and that's the only way they can alleviate that pain is through a vaporizer or a cookie or something along those lines I believe they had the right between doctors and patients and that's how it should be left the government should step out and if a doctor who ends the prescription out for xanax or pax or prozac if they've got the power to do that they should also have that same authority to recommend cannabis for medical treatment people suffering from glaucoma it releases in ocular pressure and it's restoring people's sight now you could imagine you don't want people to go blind well we can only hope that was an a representative from cannabis information Australia and stay tuned we're bringing you up-to-date coverage on medicinal cannabis legalization the unjust laws of prohibition are failing
X7iZo_af0l0,&quot;MEDICAL MARIJUANA NOW IN AUSTRALIA?!?&quot; #ZacNovakDoesVlogs,2016-08-01T15:59:28Z,"what is going on world welcome back once again my name is Zack Novak in this exact Novak rants about [ __ ] in the world Rowley in Toronto hope you enjoy so this was actually initiated today well technically yesterday today have you want to see it anyway first of August in Australia medical cannabis is now able to be prescribed by a doctor this is something that has I won't say is grinding my gears but it's making me I guess a little annoyed I guess I'll say that from the start of things must go back about say 23 years back to the point where I was pretty much googling everything about cannabis anything you can think about about weed marijuana but devil's lettuce I was looking this stuff up every single day and it wasn't to the point of me wanting to actually know all the information on it was literally just that there was a fact out there that I didn't know about this plant that at the time I was consuming and to this day yes I still do consume it you guys want to see me ever do that on here because I'll get in trouble so I won't ever do that but actually you know what I might because this is what is getting into this whole video I am actually a person who has chronic pain and I'm not so I'm trying to say that like people pay attention to me and [ __ ] aww diddums poor baby whatever you got painted [ __ ] no I'm saying that I'm in chronic pain I've take these things you can't really see them very well la Rica 75 milligrams they're fine when you go through one pack two packs three packs in a week it does kind of get a little bit to the point where i am [ __ ] sick of it i have had good gastro-oesophageal reflux disease the last five years of my life and I've had that because I've been taking medication the medication I have been taking yes does say that it could possibly cause stomach ulcers and Bob lot all this kind of stuff I don't like pain so I don't like just dealing with headaches backaches really whatever it is I'm in constant pain with my right leg that thing is completely and utterly [ __ ] up excuse my French right now but I've lost eighty-seven percent of the use from last I checked of my leg and that's not something a 22 23 year old should be going through at this age I mean even at 70 I probably shouldn't be going through it maybe if I was like jumping off roofs and things but again that's what actually caused this I jumped walk I was doing Parker with friends things were fun and all dandy and stuff and I took to a little bit too long and the friend decided to push me we were on a three-story roof a little bit high and hit the ground fractured my growth plate in my ankle and yet that's what started this whole actual [ __ ] this whole routine of me going the doctors going to the physio going to all these different places trying to actually just get some form of relief eventually yes I was prescribed pro-government la Rica this stuff that it definitely works it's not one of these things that is a hundred percent where it actually takes away the pain I still about forty-seven percent for the eight percent forty-nine percent maybe even fifty percent of the time still feel the pain but it's bearable it's enough for me to actually still function and [ __ ] and not just walk around complaining constantly all the time like at the moment I am in a chair and even sitting in chairs that is something that it wouldn't normally do this but because I had an operation about four years ago where they went in through my spine and they were going to go through the back of the leg and sever the nerve in the ankle they intentionally did so yes it was something that I had agreed upon and was willing to actually go to the process however I didn't really think about the actual downfall so that negative effects that could actually incur from this operation one of the big things was they popped the bursary in my spine the l2 bursa to be exact and that thing is frickin horrible like having any form of problems with your back is bad in itself having a desk in itself that have been burst and you aren't able to lean in certain directions or you just always constantly feel in this pinch on the nerve kind of thing which it does get seriously annoying after a while it's one of those things where if you are if you're a regular person if you are someone who can contribute to society and in the way I see contribute to society I mean if you're able to work and giving on seconds got a lot a cigarette and I failed it's let's watch by the way this is a really cool watch as you guys will see it lights up it's cool but getting back to my thing they messed up my spine they messed up a lot of things in that operation when they sever the nerve what they were supposed to do the knife had been severed and after a while the nerve in turn had reattached not to itself but to the bone and now I constantly had the pain from that since I'm the whole loss of eighty-seven percent of the actual use of the leg is mainly due to the fact that three years ago I was told that I should be using a cane or walking sticks crutches just to kind of get around certain places like around the house or if I'm just doing little things I never really picked up on that I never actually said yes that was something I needed and so long story short I now have cane and yeah I lost a lot of the actual use of my leg just from me not really being self aware of the situation now at the time as I did say I was I was researching medical marijuana well just cannabis in itself like every day I'll tell my family members I tell friends I'd tell really whoever I kind of came in contact with the information that I had learned and that was a good thing was also not really the greatest thing because some people don't really like the whole fact that you smoke a plant that can be considered illegal which is it's a plant so how does that really work out i mean there's people out there bombing places and shooting up schools and [ __ ] and still we'd is apparently one of these bad things at all no one should [ __ ] go near i am sick of this [ __ ] it's like the whole stigma like this stigmas towards so many different things in this world rank that i wouldn't a video about a few weeks ago whatever it was a stigma about black and white people that why the [ __ ] is there an actual stigma behind it like it's just stupid same thing for this I'm smoking a cigarette well my cigarettes gone out I was smoking a cigarette however this is considered legal the amount of like the amount of people who died just from these cigarettes from regular tobacco every [ __ ] year is crazy now look at the actual other page of it go oh how many people have died from smoking weed none like simple as that I think their matted in one case that there somewhere where some guy had actually ingested I think like three or four pounds of weed or something like that and he was actually allergic to it and so therefore he ended up dying but that was mainly because again it's that's a lot of plant like if you were to go out and eat 30 cantaloupes I'm pretty sure you wouldn't really be able to function for quite a long time even if you went out and ate like to say 50 chicken nuggets from macos a lot of people are not a lot of people prob like doing that I myself love chicken nuggets from mecca's given their 20 packs just myself I mean I can't help it but something I can help and hopefully that is everyone that is watching this video there's pretty much SAT around for this time if you kind of SAT around listen to me rant for this entire length this video holy [ __ ] you are amazing thumbs up because you are like number one but number two is really i want to draw a line and actually state that using something that is actually a medicine has been the medicine for thousands and thousands of years just because something comes in and actually says prohibited doesn't always mean that is the actual best bet now in turn let me just read something off here from you fall for you i should say this is the quote that is actually on the medical cannabis Australia website and this website is matakana Mehdi canna australia com that are you if you guys want to check it out i'll have a little thing on the screen here anyway medical cannabis australia's aim is to promote the health and well-being ashton chatter yet i just read the complete wrong words of skip the line medical cannabis australia's aim is to promote the health and wellness benefits of cannabis in healing and maintaining good health in humans and indeed all animals we all have the right to heal ourselves and cannabis suits our needs in so many ways cannabis as a potential not only as medicine but can positively impact the sustainability in the future of this planet cannabis can supply us with food fuel plastics and building materials 50,000 products at the moment can be made from cannabis plants in an earth-friendly way before prohibition this actually was the case before anything had actually come in before the government kind of stepped in and said this is bad this is illegal everyone was growing it and not to the point of let's get stoned let's get high everyone was growing it because it was a very very reliable resource and making a resource like that like illegal that's like going out and saying you can't you can't cut down trees anymore no long you can't have paper we can't have paper no no no doesn't matter it's illegal to cut down to the trees but the [ __ ] I guess I get in big big forestation type things like those bad and all that blah blah but this is something that kind of stems to the start the first fleet sails were made from cannabis as with a sale is closed sir joseph banks gave a bag of cannabis seeds as a gift to the first fleet to plant in the new australian colony we believe it is time for the plant the table now let's try it again we believe it is time for this plan to take back his rightful place as the most valued naturally sustainable resource the cannabis plant belongs to all of us and no one has a right to take that away from us now this in itself as it states yes blah blah blah cannabis all this stuff has been around for years now I'm just really I guess I'm just kind of head-butting the fact and kind of just bull headed to the point of them saying that that yes this can cause problems in all this blah blah we get it can cause problems we actually understand that i'm pretty sure anything in this world can cause problems like if you were to say i'm going to go skydiving is because it's healthy you're doing it because you kind of you want to you want the actually adrenaline want the rush you want to try it and I'm not saying that you should go out and try all these different [ __ ] things just because you want to have the rush or try it for the first time no actually do research into something look at the [ __ ] situation go all right well this could be potentially good for me if you're a person who has anxiety if you're a person who too suffers from depression if you're a person who has post-traumatic stress from really anything if you are a survivor of sexual assault if you're a person who has alcoholism all these different [ __ ] facts comes down to it pretty much well all these different things come down to it being one fact the plant shouldn't be illegal and i myself am only getting my opinion order which everyone is entitled to their own opinion so if you want to leave an opinion on this video then definitely do down below because i will read all the comments on this video because it is seriously a subject that i myself have had a long time to actually think about and again for the last six years of my life I've been pretty much being trapped getting more and more trapped in my own body and that's to the fact of me actually accepting these certain medications these pills that they do say can cause certain problems to your system medication medication in itself almost every form medication will cause damage to you except now the cannabis has actually come around there there really isn't that many I guess negative towards it the connotation around of you smoke weed you're a pothead and all this [ __ ] yes that is negative connotation that is a negative part of it but from what I've seen and what I've experienced in my six years of having to kind of research this like use it experiment with it all these different things I've actually seen I guess a change in a change in myself a change in the way that I'm viewing certain things sorry for looking up there there's another camera that I have I'm getting confused on certain cameras at times anyway there is a bottom line actual message that I'm trying to get out with this entire video I don't care what your actual like outlook is towards this plant as long as you can actually come to terms and actually agree upon the fact that this plant has medical benefits then honestly I'm just going to say right now you are [ __ ] stupid like seriously anyone out there who is still in this actual stigmata mindset of this drug can kill you this illicit narcotic is going to be the worst thing you can take of your [ __ ] life it's not heroin it's not [ __ ] crack and it's not ice like seriously these are these are the kind of things we need to [ __ ] watch out for in this world but this [ __ ] was made by the [ __ ] government why the [ __ ] would be your [ __ ] as made by the government when we got to [ __ ] plant this out there to be years from the natural [ __ ] earth OAS right it's illegal seriously [ __ ] and that's another good point I've got mr. Potato Prime in my head at the moment as you guys see I've got a headphone i'm on skype i've been in the skype call with mr. Potato prime for some time and his whole actual point he just brought up which was something I forgot the big fact was we is a gateway drug what the [ __ ] seriously hmm I get that yes back in the 70s there might have been this whole actual big thing of flower power man you go to get stoned in all this [ __ ] you're gonna try everything once Yolo and all this stuff you're always [ __ ] is being around like I don't know how [ __ ] long if the [ __ ] started that [ __ ] and put in the song you are stupid [ __ ] you a stupid like yes Drake that's the one you may only live once but [ __ ] sake if you're only going to live once and you're going to live yourself your [ __ ] life entirety of your entire [ __ ] life in a bubble keeping yourself [ __ ] protected from everything in this world then go the [ __ ] ahead and have fun because again you are not going to get anywhere in life if you want these people you guys well I'm just going to sit back here and play it safe for everything like you can make the biggest mistake of your life you could be one of these people at the sides hey I've got blah blah blah money from winning lottery let's go and put this money into a savings account you like I'm gonna save that I'm gonna say that until I retire blah blah and use this money when you retire in [ __ ] and a long long the line of you being retired and things you start actually realizing hmm maybe maybe I shouldn't have done that maybe I should have spent my money and actually taking that chance when I was younger too I know journey the world travel and see different faces people and places but no you decided to stay safe not touch your [ __ ] your devil's lettuce and pretty much just be one of these people to go big farmer is bad yes big farmer is bad every [ __ ] pharmaceutical company in this entire world is probably in some fun way but inherently evil if you will but again who the [ __ ] cares if this [ __ ] actually is benefiting people it's actually helping people and is causing healing actual properties in people and [ __ ] stop judging it seriously I'm getting a little bit too excited too energetic for this video where I'm just supposed to be rambling with a guess an open mind towards what you people might actually say and comment on this video everything my mind is pretty close to what I actually know the facts of what is there but yeah this video is going to be very different again it's nothing game related I don't think I said that it start but yeah I mean I can't really be that kind of person to say hey I'm only going to record game videos because that is what I'm here for and blah blah blah well kind of is but it's not I like doing gaming videos because I like playing games I like doing rent videos because sometimes it's just my opinion has to [ __ ] get out there simple as that if you guys don't like it then by all means leave a dislike on the video let me know however in the comments section way disliked it because that is something that i can change in the next video kind of thing make it better but if you guys have enjoyed the video if you have enjoyed me ranting just about cannabis the devil's lettuce weed being legal in australia as a medical use then definitely of luck in this video leave a comment download do like good stuff and i'll be cheering like hearing if he was I'd Shirin but until next time this is zach Noveck signing off once again with a rant hopefully you guys have enjoyed till next time peace out I can never ever find the right words there's no way this is real life there's no telling you're the right girl oh so I can only say that it feels right"
n_PTAiuMAto,HELEN KAPALOS TALKS MEDICINAL MARIJUANA - ABOUT TONIGHT S02E08 (20/4/15),2016-06-22T13:20:14Z,it's not a lot now then there was the food as well I know it's so good you because I'm from bathurst which is in like country New South Wales yes I'm from New Castle solved from miles away yeah oh cool are no better stairs yeah yeah yeah I'm so sorry I'm so sorry you know i love Beth it's really cool but about this is actually where Charles Sturt uni is where one of the best journalism yeah yeah is that where you went yeah i studied why I'm actually a second-year universe well there you are so yeah so a university of the bomb what can we say ah nothing well we're both studying at the moment are you yes yes I've been doing a master's in journalism and at the moment because of the dachau of suspended studies for the semester and I'm actually aligned with Swinburne University at the moment and some of the dakka the third and fourth years helping me film some of the final scenes even though there's like you know 50 hours a vision yeah I've had a director come in and look at like a film director and he just made some interesting suggestions and when I was filming part of this documentary in Israel probably the most impressive shooter and I had like amazing daps on it he was 29 and you know a stills photographer so I thought he just had that magic and he could see things in a really fresh way and I think for me having those young fresh eyes on it has just really taken a project somewhere I think that will probably make it more relatable to ya to everyone yeah so it's been really great to have that collaboration with I never thought it would go in that direction of us more sort of wedded to the idea of having proper do Pease and you know which is that's had four ninety-five percent of it yeah yeah but this five percents just like actually made forty percent difference to it you know like yeah it's been comfortable so the documentary it's about mad medical marijuana yeah it is yeah I started doing a bunch of stories last year on channel 7 on a show called Sunday night and I did a story I'm about a going tamworth and so went up to tamworth and and I thought look it's just it'll be just someone I guess talking about marijuana and pain relief he was in the final stages of liver cancer but then when I started to look into what I realized it was a far greater topic it affected so many different diseases and and there were different strains of marijuana for different things and then I went to Israel and it just I've been around the country with it and it's a yeah there's a lot more to the to the topic and then we think there's a lot more science behind it then he done a lot of us imagined would you guys like do you think it should be late like is it a matter of legalization yeah I do think medicinal cannabis I think there's still a clear distinction between recreational and medicinal and people the issue gets really polluted because people can you know don't make that distinction I'm from bathurst like a psychological director you know what do they not medicine or marijuana use and I think well it's a long-term abuse of anything will have consequences and we know that with marijuana and you know there's a particular age group particularly males 15 or 25 that you know will be a little bit linked to psychosis and schizophrenia but it doesn't actually cause it it's just um if you have that disposition it can unmask those kind of Dean's yeah I know too much about it don't get me started okay I like yeah I know a little bit I don't want to our it's gonna get a little bit serious there but I've no tell me ask all right no my brother's like had this um he like start smoking pot when he was maybe like 15 and now he's like experiencing psychosis and it's it's his a lot of humanity drug medication so it's like it's okay now now he's like 19 secrets between 15 and 25 or the really vulnerable ages it's like yeah you know cognitively especially for males yeah it's been quite scientifically I guess some robust evidence to say that it's quite strongly linked to psychosis if it's abused in that age group so hopefully he's some he's getting some good health at least if occur he definitely is i'll be sure to watch out for jackie miranne gee I sure yeah well you know it can actually help schizophrenia like some if you like you know apply the right oh yeah the right strength which is high and like what they called CBD which is not the psychoactive in Germany they actually treat schizophrenia with that particular all right so it's interesting that's incredible yeah that I feel like I've learned so much that's actually a lot of time that we have a great to be thank you so much becoming good luck with everything I think aunt wearing call tations you are you to keep like a dream in the dream I just went silk today sorry I know it looks great it looks we got double denim on camera double denim still can't a what

4bZvHIhlfiU,What You Need to Know About Medical Marijuana &amp; CRC,2016-05-19T13:40:54Z,"good evening my name is Kevin Bergersen and i am the program's assistant manager for the colon cancer alliance i would like to extend a warm welcome to in the weeds what you need to know about medical marijuana and colorectal cancer this is the final piece of our three-part into the weeds blog series which you can find on our website at CC alliance org forward slash log tonight while we're reviewing some of the history of medical marijuana and provide information for those of you considering this complimentary treatment option or those already using it for issues like chronic pain or nausea it is important to note that neither the colon cancer lines nor dr. Laura porta are giving medical advice and no doctor-patient relationship is intended or established you should always seek in person medical advice and make medical decisions together with your individual clinician team at this time it's my pleasure to introduce our presenter for this evening dr. Laura Porter medical advisor and senior patient advocate with the colon cancer alliance dr. laura is uniquely positioned to serve as our medical advisor in 2003 dr. laura was in her second year of her pediatric residency when she was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer in 2006 she became cancer-free after many medical interventions dr. Laura's medical background her battle with cancer her humor honesty and a uniquely positioned her to share her message of hope and survivor with our community dr. Laura welcome and with that I'm going to change turn the webinar over to you for the presentation okay thank you Kevin oh sorry let me show my screen sorry about that there we go okay are we good to go you are good to go when you sound great here yeah okay excellent I'd like to welcome everybody to the webinar tonight into the weeds what you need to know about medical marijuana and colorectal cancer first I'm going to start with a definition of medical marijuana this is from the National Institute for Health drug facts the term medical marijuana refers to treating a disease or symptoms of a disease with the whole unprocessed marihuana plant or its basic extracts so the topic that we're going to cover tonight are that marijuana does not cure cancer and should not be used as treatment no form of marijuana medical or otherwise has been proven to cure cancer and it is against the law for a company to claim that its product does and I think that's a something that we need to remember so some of the side effects it is supposed to treat are also the side effects of using it doctors cannot prescribe it and there's no guarantee that it contains the ingredients that that they say it might so we did a survey on our social media and with our constituents that we sent out an email to and so I'll go over the results of the survey which we found kind of surprising some of them so should more research be done on marijuana in cancer ninety-four percent of the people said yes do you think marijuana cures cancer and this was really shocking to us twenty-three percent said yes and forty-two percent said that they weren't sure so I'm hoping we're hoping that tonight with our webinar we can dispel some of those myths about that we asked if people used marijuana and thirty-seven percent said they did we asked if they used it in any form so whether that was medical marijuana or regular uh you know off the streets to speak marijuana we asked how often of those 37 37 percent sixty-three percent use it daily you can see the rest of the numbers there six percent use it a few times a week so also we asked if you do use it does your doctor know sixty-three percent said their doctor does no and thirty-seven percent said the doctor doesn't know and we'll find out why it's important that you'd let your doctor know if you're using marijuana whether its medical marijuana or whether it's regular off the street marijuana because it is important to tell your doctor because it may interfere with treatment and it's not just marijuana it's any of the supplements or any any kind of you know complementary medicine that's important so do you believe that it helps manage side effects and seventy-seven percent of the people say they do believe that it helps manage side effects and it is important to know that if medical marijuana is used for managing side effects it is used best if it is used alongside standard treatment so it is complementary to standard treatment in most cases so I'm going to just briefly go over the history of marijuana medical marijuana the use of marijuana dates back 3,000 years it was introduced into Western medicine in the 1840s in 1937 the u.s. imposed a marijuana tax a dollar an ounce for medicinal use and a hundred dollars an ounce for recreational use and the American Medical Association was against this they felt that by by imposing this tax that research would not be able to be done on marijuana because remember this was 37 so one dollar was quite a steep amount of money and then in nineteen seventy the controlled substance act classified marijuana as a schedule one narcotic so schedule one narcotics are do not have any currently accepted medical use and have a high potential for abuse so there's five schedules so no schedule one are considered the ones that do not have any medical use and included in that is heroin LSD and mescaline and schedule two narcotics are cocaine and meth amphetamine which I find a little strange but ah so here are some of the formulas that it came in in in the 1930s so I just found it corn plasters was the one that I kind of thought was interesting so I want to go over some of the terms that will be using tonight so cannabinoids so the cannabinoids are the active chemicals in the marijuana plant and there are over 100 of them Delta 9 THC or THC is the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis can have been dial is CBD which is a non Socko psychoactive agent and it is it consists of of up to forty percent of the marijuana plant and canna bin all cbn is a weak psychoactive agent mostly from the metabolism of THC so the ones that we are going to focus on tonight or THC and CBD and i'm going to go into them in a little more depth so let's go over cannabis there are variations of ingredients between different plants and strains there are over 545 chemical compounds 104 of them are the cannabinoids which are the active ingredients and as I said THC is the main psychoactive compound so what I have here is a it's a chart of of the human cannabinoid system so basically we have receptors in our body that endogenous or cannabinoids that are in our body will bind to so the cb1 now we're talking about marijuana here so now so cb1 is the one that THC which is the psychoactive component and if you look at the little man most of the light blue is in his brain so the cb1 receptors that the THC bind to are in the brain and in the spinal column the cb2 receptors are in the peripheral organs in the organs or at and have to do with the immune system so the areas of the brain that are affected by the cannabinoids and this is th see you can see plays a role in memory thinking motor skills coordination etc and it's important to know that the human brain continues to develop until age 25 therefore adolescents in particular at are at risk for adverse effects that include you know problems with thinking and learning so so let's talk about the current climate in the United States so we did get a couple of questions one of the questions was about somebody who has a marijuana card for Connecticut and wanted to know if they could take it to Florida with them and the answer is no they cannot so it is illegal to transport marijuana between states you can go to federal prison for drug trafficking I mean that's how serious it is the American Medical Association wants the DEA to scheduled marijuana to lower the scheduling from schedule 1 so that research can be done and supposedly we should have a by June there should be a decision but if marijuana is rescheduled that does not necessarily mean that more research will be done using the whole plant so that's one of the things to keep in mind so it is an income generator in states that have legalized medical marijuana and also the recreational so as far as the US government is concerned there's one farm in the University of Mississippi that grows marijuana for research and it is controlled by the National Institute of drug abuse this is at the actual plant so the ni da is accused of funding research that focuses on the negative effects of of marijuana and not on any of the possible beneficial effects so you know that's that's an issue so of the fund they funded 23 research studies in 2015 mostly focused on addiction so just to show you the NID a has several different strains of marijuana with low THC high THC medium THC so and they can control it now the the marijuana the medical marijuana that you buy from a dispensary even though it says that it has a certain percentage of THC or CBD there's no guarantee that it has that and that's one of the problems with it is that you don't know what you're getting so there are several companies that are using the extracts the can oven dials the THC and CBD to do research on and some of the these are the marijuana cigarettes that are available through the NID a so just a large supply for researchers so so now I want to talk about levels of evidence for this for the webinar and the blogs and everything we did a lot of research and what we found was that to qualify for a level of evidence and this is the level of evidence that we used for this webinar in the blog series a study must be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal and basically that's like the Journal of the American Medical Association New England Journal of Medicine similar journals they have to report the therapeutic outcomes such as tumor response or increased survival or measured improvement in quality of life and the the clinical findings need to be described in enough detail for a meaningful evaluation to be made so these are really high standards but these are the same standards that are used for FDA approval for medications these are the standards that are used for drugs I mean you would want your chemotherapy regulated this way and so and that's what the levels of evidence are so from the literature review the level of evidence moderate evidence that medical marijuana helps with spasticity and multiple sclerosis in paraplegic chronic cancer pain and neuropathy due to platinum agents now I know that many of us have been on oxaliplatin unfortunately that wasn't one of the drugs that was studied it was mostly in breast cancer patients so you know it may help with no peripheral neuropathy but we can't say for sure so weak evidence sleep problems Tourette syndrome seizures HIV induced weight loss and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting now I just want to say that we're talking about the medical marijuana I'll go into who the FDA approved extracts so at the end of the talk so next we go to no evidence there is no evidence that it treats cancer or cures cancer and you know that we really need to stress that and there's conflicting data about the the other other Oh on the other side of the chart and I think the one that applies for us is radiation induced nausea and vomiting and when I said before that the side effects it's used to treat are sometimes the side effects of the use of it I'm talking depression psychosis psychiatric disorder so it's a fine it's a fine fine line there so prescribing medical marijuana it is against the law to prescribe medical marijuana for a doctor to prescribe it a prescription pad cannot be used so what the doctor have to do is write in at a station that the patient could benefit from use and the next steps depend on the state where the where the patient is many doctors will not be comfortable recommending medical marijuana due to the lack of evidence the levels that we just discussed so and the laws differ in each state as to what's an acceptable condition and what a patient needs to do and what the different formulations in each state what is it are different somebody said that you can get you can get edibles somewhere but you can't get gummies and CBS this morning CBS sunday morning last week the week before went to a retirement home and there were people who the older people that were using the marijuana gummies for their arthritis pain and to sleep and and so that's yeah if your doctor the other thing is is if your doctor does not feel comfortable writing and attestation an attestation and ask your doctor if they can recommend somebody who may be willing to do so and to find information about each of the twenty-four states in the District of Columbia you can go to procon.org they have a nice website and talks about what conditions are covered in each state so this is from January of 2015 Pennsylvania is now a green state and texas is actually a CBD state again these are the CBD is the cannabinoid in texas there is only one condition that cannabinoids cannabidiol is approved for and that is intractable epilepsy so even the states where they allow the extracts they're very specific about what's allowed so here's just the chart of the different diseases that some of the states allow for don't don't don't worry about the don't worry about the upper column because that's the states in order to get the chart in focus I had to blur that out of it but you can see just the difference multiple sclerosis there's you know just a few states if you go across and seeing what is covered in what isn't so formulations there's oil gummies edibles and topicals and these are usually extracted from the plant again marijuana in any form does not cure cancer there are also creams and the plant can be smoked or vaporized the problem is is that's smoking is the smoking is the quickest way to get it into the body but it is also you know they don't know for sure if it causes cancer but combustion most likely causes cancer so that's one of the concerns about smoking the whole plant now there are companies that are looking at the extracts THC and CBD for use in for use in in treating side effects so so the other thing is is the concentration of the cannabinoids differ and cannot be guaranteed that's so the adverse effects smoking anything may cause cancer one of the questions we got was about elevating CEA so we don't know if it elevates CEA not enough has been done about it but we know that smoking cigarettes elevate CEA so it may not be a big jump to think that smoking marijuana does too it is a drug and it impairs judgment and motor skills use it with the same care you use narcotic medications and don't drive in the states where it is legal there has been an increase in marijuana related traffic fatalities so that's another thing I mean we're I you know you need to be careful if you're going to use it and again no quality control so some of the top considerations tell your doctor if you use marijuana and the frequency of that use marijuana is metabolized in the liver as our many chemotherapy agents and also dietary supplements and they can interfere with your chemotherapy evaluate if the side effects and adverse effects of medical marijuana out way the perceived benefits and also if you choose to use medical marijuana for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting it is best to use it along with standard treatments and and medical marijuana along with many of the fda-approved drugs in and including alcohol all have adverse effects so weigh the pros and con cannabis in any form including oil does not cure cancer just because it is natural doesn't mean it is safe and in addition there is not any evidence that it prevents cancer and the oil that is all over the Internet can actually be toxic due to high concentrations of chemicals if you're going to use medical marijuana do not think of it as a cure-all in all claims of people that have said that that cured their cancer they were used it was used alongside conventional therapy so some people use marijuana thinking it will cure them and then when they go to get treatment it is too late and we were on our scientific advisory committee call on Monday and one of the doctors on the committee said that he had a patient who went out and said he was going to treat his cancer with marijuana and by the time the patient came back it was too late then the patient died I I saw a couple different articles about that so and the list of acceptable conditions and the amount of medical marijuana person is allowed to have or grow depends on the state you live in some states allow you to to grow it some states don't allow you to grow it some states have dispensaries others don't so you really need to look up what your state has and medical marijuana is not guaranteed to have what it says there's not a regulatory body mom during the manufacturing and if you have a history of substance abuse better to not use it approximately nine percent of adults that use marijuana become addicted to it and so let's see so I want to just spend a couple minutes on legal cannabinoid compounds these are FDA approved the concentrations are documented tested and standardized by the FDA södra been dropped Robin all sorry about that is also called marinol and it is used for nausea and vomiting and i'll tell you in 2003 when i started on chemotherapy oxaliplatin the very first weekend i carried around the dishpan the whole weekend and and i just vomited that's all I did for two days it was horrendous and then they tried me on another thing and then they tried me on another one and another one and it wasn't until I started taking the marinol with about four other four other medications that the vomiting was actually controlled and then there's the CBD or says met that is also used for nausea and vomiting and there's a new it's not new in the world it is new in the United States and it's in phase 3 trials it's called sativex and it is believed to infant the effects of opioids so it works with opioids to reduce the amount of opioids that people with intractable pain require so in closing I just want to say that one of the survey respondents said that pot didn't cure me but being able and willing to eat kept my strength up and I just want to say also I just again that I want to thank everybody who contributed to the making of the webinar the podcast that was done yesterday and the blog post your help and support was indispensable and it did take a village to get this off the ground and and I do want to thank them olive everybody including our survey participants in our focus groups acting you Kevin all right thank you dr. Laura appreciate that at this time we're going to have some questions in the very near future for you and but first but first I'd like to introduce Steve Haley who is going to briefly talk about how medical marijuana has helped him steve is a 60 year old father of six an inoperable metastatic colon cancer survivor who was originally diagnosed in early 2010 Steve welcome would you tell us a little bit about your story sir Thank You Carolyn good evening 2009 was an extremely stressful year the economy was in a dismal state our business was in dire straits our reserves were depleted we were seriously and dead end we had lost our home I've been experiencing what i assumed to be stress related symptoms abdominal pain indigestion constipation insomnia loss of appetite and loss away by the beginning of 2010 I was in serious trouble and the thought of cancer had never crossed my mind februari 26 2010 I went to the ER complaining of severe abdominal pain and constipation a CT scan revealed a large massive form low in my abdomen on March third emergency exploratory surgery was performed during which I was given a temporary colostomy an attempt was made to remove the mask and a sample was taken for biopsy March 5th the surgeon came to see me my wife Elita was at my side I've been impatiently waiting to hear results and surgery but was so optimistic that all had gone well my life my world as I knew it ended with what came next I was informed that the attempt to remove the mass had failed that it had involved multiple organs multiple liveth notes was rock hard and malignant I was dumbfounded cancer they had no idea that such a thing as colorectal cancer existed let alone that I could have it cancer was something that happened to other people I remember the enormity of what was happening on what we were being told that that day we heard things like it's as bad as it gets we may get you three years and you have a long hard road ahead of you here the hopelessness the flood of emotions that came rushing home our life as we knew it had come to an end March eighth i underwent a second surgery to insert a drain in an abscess that was causing a lot of the pain at this point i was flat on my back and continued to be in considerable pain I had a patch on my back and chest fentanyl and what else I don't recall and they were administering IV pain killers as frequently as they could I lay in that bed rug induced haze drifting in and out until the pain would bring me back to reality and then I'd spend what seemed like an eternity in a worsening agony until they could administer more I spent the remainder a march in the hospital and begin chemo and radiation therapy the next time I made the trip to our business I was lying across the rear seat with tears streaming down my face from the pain of the trip our business is located in a business park and a few years before a medical marijuana dispensary had opened a few doors away and I knew its owner quite well we pulled into the parks driveway and he was outside the dispensary when he saw me he asked me what was wrong I told him I had cancer and wasn't hagin II he asked me if he thought his product would help at that point I told him I was willing to try anything about five minutes later he bought a small selection he proceeded to light a marijuana cigarette and put it in my mouth I smoked about half and promptly fell fast asleep and that was absolutely amazing because for much of the prior year I had not slept more than an hour at a time and was not sleeping regularly at all aletta woke me six hours later and i finished the other half and went out again when i will woke I was so relaxed the pain was still there but to a lesser degree but the body tension was gone and for a first time in a long while I actually felt like I could survive that was all it took I was sold the following years were brutal but we're now more manageable I went through multiple surgeries Ned reoccurrence and was rediagnosis inoperable I was told I'd be gone by 2014 chemo continued and I suffered terribly from the side effects my CA kept rising and the mask kept growing early 2014 things begin to improve by April last year my CA had dropped significantly and the massive hunk by thirty percent so a break from chemo begin it's now been 13 months and the break continues throughout the years to medical marijuana has made a huge difference not only with the nausea and depression but as more potent extracts and different strains became available as I gained knowledge and experience I was able to end the heavy regimens of painkillers muscle relaxers and steroids thus the constellation has reduced markedly and I control what remains with grocery store laxatives and diet I gained back 50 pounds at times things still hurt but now it's manageable without the opioids and other drugs and they're always on the shelf with I need a move and with that I'll turn things back over to you Kevin right Steve thank you very much that was awesome I appreciate your sharing we still have a few minutes for dr. laura.and.steve to answer your questions joining them to provide regulatory expertise this evening is Frank sapienza from the drug and chemical advisory group a consulting group specializing in drug development guidance or the pharmaceutical industry for products containing abusable substances Frank is a retired 30-year veteran with the US Drug Enforcement Administration where he served in your scientific advisor and technical and policy matter currently Frank also serves as a member of the board of directors for the colon cancer alliance Frank welcome to our panel thank you to submit a question buddy the way we're going to do it is click on the small plus sign located next to the word questions on the right side of your screen type your questions in hit enter and if we're unable to get to your question this evening we will respond to you via email later on so our first question tonight comes to us from Gina who has been asking what is the difference between CBD extracted from hemp instead of marijuana and I'll open that to the panel hamper for us to cannabis indica one of the two major strain divisions of cannabis there are kiss cannabis sativa and cannabis indica cannabis indica was used throughout history before synthetic says rope that's where it got the name him and she had a follow-up to that and this is the medical side of the question then would be for dr. Laura does both CBD and THC play any part in fighting crc Oh as of right now that there there's no evidence that it does that that either of them do so you know that's all I can say is there's no evidence in terms of fighting crc but managing side effects perhaps or is some window there yes yes absolutely absolutely Kevin thank you for pointing that out yes as a treatment or as cure or for finding the actual cancer there is no evidence there's some evidence that it does help with nausea vomiting and pain okay this next question comes to us from Sarah and this is for you Frank have there been any reclassifications of specific drugs within the controlled substance act since it was introduced in 1970 seems like a lot of research would have been happening since then uh yes sir there have been quite a few drugs that have been rescheduled son from schedule 1 into lower schedules once a drug is approved for marketing if it's in schedule 1 then a rescheduling analysis takes place by both the fda the department of health and human services and the Drug Enforcement Administration and then based on that analysis the the drug product as well as the drug itself will be rescheduled from schedule 1 to a lower schedule some examples that come to mind are soo fentanyl alfentanil Marinol itself is going to reschedule Lauren or wasn't scheduled one because it contained THC on this approval in 1985 it was rescheduled to schedule 2 and then subsequently was actually rescheduled to schedule 3 so there is a process procedure in criteria for rescheduling drugs particularly once they are approved for legitimate use in the United States interesting interesting thanks Frank a question here from rod and this this has to do with a and it's an efficacy question is there a difference in ethic effectiveness or efficacy with AE joints or vaporizer cigarettes Steve II actually they all use oil so i would say no there isn't a difference in the different types of vaporizers other than the content that can put into them there is a difference than the plant itself like dr. laura said when you're smoking a plant you're burning wood and inhaling carcinogenic materials I don't care who tells you better with you depends the e-cigarettes your vaporizing the extraction that's a good point to make their very different combination apps for sure and catherine has asked a question what are platinum agents oh that's that's a good question for colon cancer treatment for the treatment of colorectal cancer oxaliplatin is the one that is used it's actually it's a heavy metal so and i believe for breast can sir it's carboplatin so there's a lot of it's basically it's a like I said it's a heavy metal and it's used for chemotherapy and it tends to settle in the nerves somehow so haven't have a question here from Sarah it's another medical question is cannabinoid hyper mises syndrome a real thing and if so how much of a risk is it with the medicinal uses you know what I don't know the answer to that I have heard about it but I don't know I can get back to you about that hyperemesis as a result of taking the CBD I believe is what the question is yes ya see that and that goes back to what I was saying that a lot of times the side effects are the same as what it's used to treat so hyperemesis just in case uh yeah let me just tell you what hyperemesis is it is a lots of vomiting so it's excessive vomiting so so the fact that it can be caused by CBD I guess in some people not necessarily everybody then and and that's what it's given to treat so hyper I've got a question here from from Christine and it's a it's a medical question and it has to do with has there been any studies that you're aware of regarding the injection of THC or CBD directly into tumors and if there any known results wow that's a really good question and actually I put that in one of the blog posts there has been research done injecting THC into glioblastoma multiforme a which is a extremely aggressive malignant brain tumor after diagnosis if it was it recurs and it always does recur it has a one-year survival actually the average survival is ten months and it's extremely it's extremely deadly and so what they did was they actually injected THC into the tumor like it wasn't a large number patients but it did shrink the tumor unfortunately the tumor grew back and the people died in the same amount of time as those who did not get the injection so even though it Shrunk the tumor it did not cure the disease and it did not alter the course of the disease and this is what's important to remember it didn't alter the course of the disease so and I just I also want to say that in Israel they are doing a lot of studies using cannabis in people that are end-stage cancer and using it for treatment to do clinical trials with so there is research being done it's not being done here in the United States but it is being done in the world Israel has a a very large as a very large research community with for cannabis and if you even if you go on clinical trials.gov which I did I went on clinical trials gov and i put in cannabis and cancer and the clinical trials that came up we're all in Israel very good i have a Canuck question here for frank and are there any attempts being made to quality control any of the extracts or is it just not possible until it is lower or completely legalized and thank you Shawn for that question ah yeah those extracts that are being studied by pharmaceutical companies and by other legitimate researchers are analyzed and assessed for qualitative and quantitative composition so the sense that any any research being done those materials are definitely of a known qualitative and quantitative composition the other formulations that are being sold as dietary supplements are not regulated by actually any federal state or local government agencies and it's up to those individuals that market those products to sort of regulate themselves and to ensure that there is a standard quality qualitative and quantitative composition and that's done more or less depending upon he's actually marketing these products and that's the concern that they they may be of unknown composition there's there's news releases every day by the Food and Drug Administration if they identify dietary supplements containing ingredients that are unlabeled I've not seen any would cannabis oils that I'm aware of but that certainly is possibility interesting interesting a medical question here from James would like to know if there's any clinical trials that are available for the use of medical marijuana anybody aware of well I'm not I'm not aware of any I know that the state's some of states like Colorado and California are doing in state trials but as far as like federal NC hi there there aren't any you can enjoy the boy go ahead I don't know if um if Frank or Steve know of any but I didn't find any uh nother to my knowledge is Frank to my knowledge there there are no clinical trials with smoked marijuana now there there are clinical trials as dr. Laura mentioned earlier on some of the active ingredients in cannabis and there are clinical trials with some of the extracts if there are several pharmaceutical companies that are investigating cvd and combinations of THC and CBD for for various conditions so those types of clinical trials are are available but but none with the whole impact plant material in the United States and I know of no authorized survey or studying the state of California it's very certainly do complexity of the law interesting they got another question here from joy is there some medical evidence that marijuana unmasks some cancer cells so that our bodies can attack the cancer and any anybody aware of those out of condition I think I think that I think probably what she's referring to is the CBD hmm that is that is is a I gosh an immune in the immune system so it works on the immune system so inflammatory system so uh that could be what she's referring to but as far as any evidence um I didn't come across any and then Kathy is asking a medical medical marijuana card issue she doesn't have a doctor that can prescribe marijuana so and she wants to know why she has to go to a doctor before she can get her card and I you know and it seems like the medical marijuana card regulations are so diverse in each of the states that allow it that it's going to be hard to give a unique answer just for that because each state is going to be different right and procon.org will have that information and the reason that you need to see a doctor is because it is you know medical marijuana so a doctor needs to be the one that prescribes it just like he would prescribe or she would prescribe your you know your chemotherapy or or antibiotics things like that so they're the ones that have to write the right the attestation because they can't prescribe it and so go to pro con organ and just scroll down the page and you'll come to your state oh yeah I was good right on time in a minute go ahead Steve the reason that the doctors cannot prescribe marijuana is because it is not available there there is no source of marijuana that's available that they could guarantee would have the composition that they're saying at but but yet a doctor-patient relationship is definitely critical and the most important thing in in taking care of once once health so instead of a prescription and start to Laura says that doctors provide attestation they are the ones that are in the best position along with your your health to determine whether or not marijuana or its extract will help you so that's why you have to see a doctor even though the yorkie cannot prescribe something for you excellent point data has a question here about in terms of if your cancer patient is an edible version or variant going to be better for you as a casher patient then then some form a combustible version well like like Steve was saying I'll let him talk about it too but it's Steve was saying combustion of anything you know is not safe so you know the smoking of anything isn't safe but Steve do you have anything to add exactly dr. Laura you personally combusting wood which is essentially what the plant is it produces the merit of toxic gases we what we do to eliminate that we extract the drug and vaporize the drug itself okay well in in with that we're just about out of time for this evening as a reminder all of you in attendance will receive a follow-up email with a link for a very short feedback survey about this webinar we value your opinion a great deal and I promise it should only take a minute or two thank you in advance for going out that survey and we appreciate your help and let us know how we're doing some of you may have some questions you may want to ask about colorectal cancer treatment in a more personal one-on-one setting if you would like to speak directly with one of our certified patient that then we support navigators or if you have any other colorectal cancer questions please feel free to contact our team at 877 422 20 30 or visit them online for a live chat that CC alliance that orgy before we go please join us next month June twenty eighth that's 7 p.m. eastern time for our next conversation webinar series the latest in colorectal cancer findings from the 2016 ASCO annual meeting join our presenter dr.

Beic7CoH6XA,"Part 2: Dr David Caldicott, Australian Medicinal Cannabis Observatory",2016-06-09T06:54:33Z,so in summary these are very interesting times and they are both good and bad we're seeing the best and the very worst not only of consumers but are also people conducting research I myself have tried very hard not to be frustrated by it with varying degrees of success there there is progress in this space it is happening it's its just oh now now you've not ejected me heavens above that I've been either you've destroyed me here I thought I was perfectly good at doing this myself but I would say that this market is is very naive and vulnerable at the moment there are very sophisticated consumers and representatives from the community but when I see who's out there when i see the sophistication of the campaign's particularly coming in from overseas and particularly informing researchers who are in australia I'm a I'm nervous there are going to be profits for anybody who gets in this space that's not an issue and there'll be articles as well there'll be abundance of both you'll be awash in money if that what gets you going there's plenty to go around but if you ever watched an episode of Game of Thrones you know what happens to people who try to keep it all to themselves you're going to get eviscerated and it'll probably be the community that does it to you so yeah the kind of people I'm sending that warning to aren't in the room at the moment but please forward it to them and at all stages at all stages in this this has got to be driven by the patient you know you may not like that term but I'm a doctor and if the patronage of the patient is going to determine the success of how this works we have got a lot of stuff we can learn from from America we need to learn from that so that we don't replicate them some of the mistakes some of the systems in place there are fabulous but there are enough of mistakes for us to learn from in the US so if you're interested in what we're doing come and chat to me answer our survey as I say there's another survey out there and I'm hugely flattered that you know people found a need to copy it you can support us the I don't need your money thank you very much but what I do or what I would appreciate would be the vote of confidence so we've got a link here you can give a two dollar donation which is tax deductible and that will be far more powerful to us than any of the money that you get unless you want to give us like a bajillion in which case that would be really useful but really the people who are involved in the observatory are very dedicated to this at a personal level and that to me sells it for my involvement and hopefully for yours as well I don't know if these things exist anymore but I was told to put them up QR code so you probably it's completely out of date my I don't even know if my phone reads them but that's the one for the survey and that's the one to say hi so these are my details I really want to chat and I'm getting nothing for doing any of this I am NOT in bed with anyone apart from my devastatingly attractive wife so please come and chat to us and be careful these are dangerous but interesting times thanks me oh sorry yeah of course dr. cold again Oh any time professor chip what would it be with it amazing tech guys gonna try to get them running oh yeah yeah yep oh so this is in this the sphere of agronomy and I have vague ideas about it certainly a GMO is being applied particularly at a Tamworth so the United and compassion folk are working very closely with the Department of Primary Industries and Graham King Graham King I don't know if you know is one of the big hemp botany dudes who is based at Southern Cross so they're working to provide GMO produced crop the strains I don't actually know what they're using at the moment I I think i could find out for you if that's something of of interest to you but I ya know not a problem I'm it's it's it's come it's super duper secret squirrel and I actually if you're if you go on to the extent of planting crops I'm not really sure what the benefit and keeping the strain secret is i'm not sure if there's you know why you need to do that so you know I concern there's a lady sitting beside you who could ask a question in Parliament and probably find out for your far quicker than I could yes sir or for which bit sir so the survey is up and running the the registry and the education process will be oh look the man is made at work my god the the registry and the the analytical facility will be available by the end of the year the curriculum is written and we're just setting it up on a university platform those of you who have worked with universities the terribly clever people who are also incredibly dumb at the same time so that's the delay the delay is also that all of us who are involved in this are doing it in roll our own time and we are obviously got full time jobs as well yep oh you might have just misheard sir I think it's good to learn from their mistakes yeah yep thank you yep yeah funny time to be in Australia and try the guys I think I mean the problem now right now this very instant is that we're in the middle of an electoral cycle and so until the dust settles from that we are going to be finding it somewhat difficult to to get any leverage I'm hearing some tremendous during that get it I don't know it's dance music and that makes me want to dance but it's not there's no video element Turner oh oh oh yeah yeah so this is your music this is this what you listen to when you're it's very new it's oh no no it's just David it's always just David hey man yeah yeah well at the moment we're in so the first thing that you know we kind of need is to get our licenses finalized so you know failing that then we if we don't do that we could be accused to supply but after that yes yes we so we're in negotiation with the AFP as to how we can facilitate that fortunately we have a model already you probably aware that I've been so it's slightly involved in the business of drug testing and the so we are in a position to to provide substances for analysis so that that Rubicon has been crossed so we're in a position to facilitate that the laboratories at the ANU now are in the process of applying for the appropriate licenses to be allowed to receive and as soon as we have those then we're good to go but we're very fortunate that we're in the AC T so my own belief and I I'm merely speculation is that it will actually be very straight bat stuff that there's not going to be any sort of quirky political intervention to try to derail it I'm told that that would be a few months so that that's what we hope for well we'll see I believe it when it's there oh my goodness heavens above oh you froze it at a very ugly person quick though I am revolted get and get me off it's disgusting I don't think you've got sound can you hear that okay started from the beginning there in here so Helen capillaris who it is is a famous glamorous TV present ater from from Australia has basically taken her life savings because this is what she believes in and has gone and invested in doing a film on this and this is this a part of it so look out for this this will be out this year and I think it's going to push the cause forward substantially because it'll open the eyes of a lot of people cheers
d9-U3jKg7Vs,Reefer Madness II : The  People versus the Law,2016-04-22T19:35:06Z,"you know the idea that well you shouldn't take marijuana because it makes you feel good is absurd this kind of trading citizens like like babies that can't make their own decisions and they're classifying it up there with cocaine heroin methamphetamines ecstasy are you kidding me cannabis as we know in the last 5,000 years is called zero deaths the evidence about the medicinal applications of cannabis is overwhelming Oh many parts members in the closet in the open kind of in the gray area on the fence and they're everywhere well I can't people smoke a joint and go on relax but it can go into a pub and get Johnson and have a fight with your best mates and stuff like that you know it doesn't make any sense really but I think there is a lack of understanding and aleko empathy probably among some drug users that is the alcohol drinkers against people who are other drug users that is for example cannabis movies if you're a smart person you know that spending billions of dollars trying to prevent people taking drugs has not worked for 40 years is not going to can't work it for the next 40 years so we need a new solution vote vote for a political party that's actually got some sort of practical evidence-based solutions I think the idea that people take too many too too many drugs and have problems is true but the way to deal with that is not prohibition is not finds its not locking people up its social services that's all we need in this country for a whole heap of problems paper animal food building human food clothing medicine rope sales fuel reefer madness was a propaganda campaign that came to Australia from the United States in the late 1930s there were three major players media Baron William Randolph Hearst the Commissioner for the Federal Bureau of Narcotics Harry J Anslinger Canadian magistrate and author Emily Murphy the campaign was fueled by fear greed and racism marijuana makes fiends of boys in 30 days hashish Gold's uses the bloodlust are the tons it's coming into this country the deadly dreadful poison that racks and tears only at a body but at the very heart users of marijuana becomes stimulated as they inhale the drug and are likely to anything most crimes of violence in this section especially in country districts are laid to users of that drug you furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war addicts to this drug while under the influence are immune to pain and could be severely injured without having any realization to their condition while in this condition they become raving maniacs and a liable to kill or indulge in any form of violence to other persons there are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the US and most are Negroes Hispanics Filipinos and entertainers the satanic music jazz and swing results from marijuana use this marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes entertainers and any others the primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate races newspaper man Randolph Hearst was heavily invested in timber plantations hemp was his chief competitor Anslinger had family connections to dupont chemical who had just payton to deny lon hemp was their main competitor and curiously DuPont chemical financed the movie reefer madness that is only through enlightenment that this scourge can be wiped out in these drugs is opium morphine and heroin and more vicious more deadly even than these soul-destroying drugs is the menace of marijuana the reefer madness campaign changed the name of cannabis and hemp to marijuana which they touted as the new menace he never could before known for alcohol prohibition wasn't long gone the DEA were out of work hearse was in control corruption and conspiracy to wheels began to roll the world war two it was grown by the tongue when the war was over another had begun the chains along Congress media was alive how green crime all looking behind your country shisha paper and I love the cold the haircut disappeared no one knows Harry jayasinghe he got it way reefer madness the order update heck it may be sailing the high seas make clothes paper see humanity for hibited by law number one target in an outbreak in taxi long time to action legislation the only way yeah I've been doing this for a long time you've been on the front line I think so many years yes and so what have you learned from that experience we have known since nineteen seventy-four that marijuana kills cancer cells and yet people are just that's just becoming revelation now we've known since 1947 that marijuana is very effective at dealing with seizure disorder and yet that's big news in 2014 that my goodness cannabis is useful in treating seizures I think the media has also been complicit in this and has basically highlighted the recreational aspects and when they do that it's the more outrageous recreational users yeah and then when it comes to why this is a stepping stone which by the way has been thoroughly debunked this is the gateway gateway drug and actually cannabis is an exit drug a lot of people with PTSD the returning military or people that have been in natural disasters or have been raped or abused have found that cannabis is actually more effective with far fewer side effects than the prescription medication and people tell me about prescription medication that has been prescribed for their PTSD that they feel like a zombie yeah and with cannabis they feel like themselves and you know they're just normal so what we're doing is we're we're criminalizing ill health in a way exactly yes we're criminalizing ill health and we're making it very difficult for researchers and physicians to use this in a manner which has been used for almost 5,000 years I mean the first pharmacopoeia by oral history in China was said to have been written in 2637 bc and it contained cannabis so that at least how far back it goes and since they wrote about it then they probably knew about it a little bit before that but everybody who uses cannabis it makes them calmer helps relieve their anxiety helps them sleep helps them enjoy life more improves their quality of life so you know I think that Dennis Peron once said that all use is medical and at one time I thought he was sort of over the top on that but the longer that I've been around it the more I recognize that there is medical value I've seen people who are extremely ill people who have neurodegenerative diseases people have multiple sclerosis Parkinson's and one gentleman with Parkinson's who was a painter I mean an artistic painter and he gave me a picture and he said I'm giving you this dr. bjurman because it wasn't for you I wouldn't still be painting and of course it wasn't me it's the plant and people said we have a lot of courage and I say all I've done is read the literature all I've done is kept an open mind the states we can advertise prescription drugs on the television and there's this long laundry as the side effects that the read off and they say and may cause death and and cannabis is one of the safest therapeutic agents known to man and that is a quote of the Drug Enforcement Administration's chief administrative law judge in 1988 who recommended rescheduling cannabis to schedule 2 so that doctors could actually prescribe it with specific dosages and specific content of THC and CBD be the very first thing that should have happened 10 years ago if not earlier is the legalization of medicinal cannabis that is canvas for medicinal uses whether you are a user because you're suffering from some kind of illness or condition whether you're the person supplying that person who's the patient that is clearly for me in a absolute separate category absolutely crystal clear that that should be activity the evidence about the medicinal applications of cannabis is overwhelming dozen minutes and a cure every condition for every person that's not the idea it's some level of treatment that some people should be able to choose and it comes down to that individual persons right in my view if you want to choose this particular treatment for your particular condition that's actually you're right it is a medicinal issue and it should be seen completely separate from other uses of service so there is enough research and evidence because the government is very big on having evidence-based research to make their policies on so is there enough research now to prove medical cannabis the evidence has been complete and convincing and necessary to go further really for about 15 years I mean the idea of taking a medical condition substance abuse and criminalizing it is absurd imagine throwing people in prison for having cancer why should we throw people in prison for having the disease of substance abuse Oh so in rough terms the number of people who smoke cannabis every year in Australia is getting close to the number of people who smoke cigarettes in Australia the number of people who smoke cigarettes is declining the number of people smoking cannabis goes up and down a little bit the right you know the number of people each year is between two and A two and two and a half million in Australia again at a rational level when you think about it you think about the evidence you think about the proof is this system working what are the objectives of the system to stop people using drugs well isn't working well no but but the the difference between the cannabis smokers and the cigarette smokers is most people who smoke cigarettes smoke every day of the year and and smoke quite a lot of cigarettes 15 to 20 cigarettes very few smoke just a few cigarettes now and then there are some or very few people smoke 60 cigarettes a day so people are bunched around the middle with cannabis is quite different a small number of people smoke every day most people who smoke cannabis smoke once a week once a month once in two months or even less frequently so we want to be able to educate children about you know drug usage and the risks that risks and health risks around that and we want to give them time to mature and make that decision like we do with alcohol and tobacco we don't allow minors to it's illegal to sell to minors it's illegal to give it to minors so we could apply the same set of laws if to marijuana if you know we talk about treating drugs the same as we treat the other drug alcohol and tobacco it was all but those are really bad it said well yes that's why we strictly regulate them and control where they sold and who they're sold to and we control how much is bought by by the tax price so we have you know 80,000 people being arrested just for drug consumer offences in Australia each year and of them sixty-five percent are arrested for a can US possession offense so we're talking about 60,000 people arrested just for the possession of a small quantity of cannabis see there's no I don't think anyone could provide any of and it's to show that that's a really effective way of pullet using police time or spending spending our tax revenue but it's not just the cost it's also it's two things one is that it essentially diverts police away from other kinds of policing activities that have been much more useful for example cracking down on domestic violence but the other thing is that some of these policies actually increase the harm of illicit drug use and we've really seen that with the drug detection dog program which has essentially been a way of encouraging music festival attendees to use more dangerous drugs than cannabis because those drugs are less detectable but the way the police enforce the Lord the way the police for example have got sniffer dogs as many people be aware whether they take those sniffer dogs they don't take them to the fancy hotels in the eastern suburbs but they might be able to cocaine being used and so on among the professional and the the very rich people in the Sydney situation they go to places i read from railway station they go to places like music festivals they go to places where they know that they will catch a large number of people and easy targets easy targets people who don't know their rights or have the burial fish in a barrel if we want to make young people save they need information and they need realistic information at the moment the drug information they get says that cannabis is just as dangerous as methamphetamines it's just as dangerous as the most potent form of ice there's no differentiation it's all drugs are bad and so if young people are told all drugs are equally bad well how can they make an informed choice about what's likely to cause addiction what might cause harm what might you know destroy their relationships they can't do you want your son or daughter to end up with a criminal record for experimenting with drugs with our current policy sediments it's the completely random element for particularly for young people's lives you can have two groups of young people doing well at school well connected with their families positive happy futures one of them randomly gets targeted and found and charged with a Dean supply and their entire future is compromised the other group doing exactly the same activity taking the same drugs just don't get randomly targeted they go through their life they're successful they're happy and they don't have that disastrous interaction with our criminal justice system we know that people go on and have productive happy fulfilling contributing adult lives it's just we randomly destroy the lives of some because of these bizarre policy settings what we see out here in Australia it's very interesting coming back to that type of mentality when in Colorado right now we can we can use cannabis freely without paranoia being caught or pulled over and drug tested and arrested at that point it's my only on the edges of town just letting everyone know coming in or they're going out that this is the presence here and it's still a legal thing I'm just going to come down your ass because they've got quotas to fill but certainly from other other countries other places where they have had a more liberal approach than the prohibition approach the Colorado in the side of the United States made a legal in all most most most respects any weather through asterisks but mostly legal to possess and use cannabis the early statistics show that the local population usage of cannabis as Colorado residents has actually gone down a little bit Colorado the availability of marijuana on school grounds went down by five percent crime rates are down thirteen percent domestic violence rates are down alcohol-related deaths are down pharmaceutical related deaths are down heroin over you know I mean the list goes on and on so the war on drugs is costing a lot of money a lot of taxpayers money one of the benefits if we did legalize it or decriminalize it what are the economic benefits you're absolutely right i mean i think i think the savings are enormous and when we and we are literally talking about four billion dollars at least in savings but then when you look at our industry being and they estimate and this is the police estimates and they're probably conservative that the drug industry that Australians by approximately ten billion dollars worth of drugs every year I know you ten billion dollars worth of drugs that is a conservative estimate across all areas the in the hydroponic marijuana industry in Victoria alone is estimated by the police at 1.5 billion dollars so this is a big-money industry so even if we could only get GST off it we're talking a good billion dollars back into tertiary so working at a farm it just sounds so normal like you know I work at the local dairy or something I mean we we will be shocked in Australian we heard that so you worked at the medicinal what's it called it's just a medicinal marijuana farm there thousands of them and um it's not uncommon but what's really common is the medicinal marijuana pharmacies in California so you know the pharmacies here or I guess you'd call them chemist with the Red Cross sign in California their green crosses and as long as you're registered marijuana medicinal marijuana card holder that was given to you by a doctor then you are legally allowed to go by any of their products like I was I was a growing cannabis in my two bedroom apartment I had my medical licenses to do so and I'd walk into a dispensary and I'd walk out with like thirty two hundred bucks man straight up cash in my pocket I was like well this kind of looks familiar you know it's just a retail shop though so they had to put regulations in place so from 2008 to 2014 they really wrap their heads around the regulatory aspect of things on a medical point of view and then when they came into the legalization 2012 they spent two years to 2014 getting all of the legislative regulations in place and what had happened was no one was allowed to open a retail shop a legalized recreational retail shop without being a dispensary before hi okay so then all the tax system is set up right there's you know you don't have to go through this learning curve man everything can very easily transition over and I think that was a pretty good step for Colorado to do that to control it and thus far it's been a great success and I think it's really wonderful because in a lot of ways it really helps the state and it really helps the people and I it's really building up their economy in an incredible way and this is why we're so excited is that now we can bring this model to different regions in different countries and say hey look this is really benefiting society here and culture even in the non-users they're getting all this indirect economy stimulation as well you know people are staying in hotels people are filling up their gas tanks people are eating people are going to the bars to go into a baseball game you know people are coming in from all over the place so you know all around success mom yeah you know the billions of dollars that we spend on trying to enforce these unenforceable laws is money we could be spending far more product production health in education in housing in infrastructure 25% of Colorado has embraced cannabis legalization and we pulled in 70 million dollars last year in tax revenue so if the rest of the black market for example got online in Colorado that number might be what 200 210 million now you're starting to talk man you know no that's a lot of stools that's a lot of public services yeah yeah how about this how about this because Australia right now for example is is not embracing cannabis and there is a thriving black market why don't we do this why don't we not touch the existing existing footprint of anything else legalize cannabis regulate it tax it you know we know that when we put the tax price up on alcohol we can affect we can reduce the sales of it so we could regulate the sale of these drugs and if we were looking at a thirty percent tax on that industry it's a three billion dollars yeah now you know that is a lot of infrastructure that is a lot of schools that is a lot of you know fantastic health services there seems to be a big disconnect in this country between what mr. and mrs. average are doing because a lot of people are smoking marijuana a lot of people now using it medical cannabis between what people are doing and the law what's going on there look I think that the frightening thing is and I think the major parties they're always going for 51 percent of the vote so if they don't think that 51 percent of the vote is going to support them then they're not going to do it because they're going to lose the election and they're going to lose their jobs and it generally gets smaller than that because most members of parliament hold their positions by four percent so if they think that there's four or five percent of the population who will change their vote on this issue who are strongly prohibitionist then they're too afraid to act and I think it needs to be sort of the minority parties in the smaller parties that just have to push it through I mean [ __ ] if thirty percent of the population voted for me and that's the number who support legalization of cannabis I we'd had members in every house in in Australia law I think has been in place for such a long time and the political class C so that's something that really is fundamental but that it seems to be just ingrained into the major party politicians anyway for so long that they we just have to have this war on drugs this sort of approach that drugs are bad and the only way to force up or to force people or to encourage people maybe does not use drugs is to make a very heavy penalties for it and so on this is all the rhetoric about cracking down on the suppliers the reality is it's people who are the uses of drugs who are overwhelmingly the people who are bearing the punishment load politicians are now starting to recognize the war on drugs doesn't work just a year ago 29th of april 2014 Prime Minister Tony Abbott said on 3aw radio that the war on drugs is a war that cannot be won and it's a war that can be lost but nevertheless we should keep on fighting it he said those exact words now I agree with the first part congratulations to him for saying at no previous Prime Minister leader the Opposition in Australia had ever said that before but surely if what we're doing doesn't work and can lose and can't win then clearly we should be going back to the drawing board and thinking about other options we've had half a dozen former commissioners of police in Australia and some serving commissioners of police saying we can't arrest or imprison our way out of this terrible mess that we're in and it's time politicians got their message and started to look at the alternatives but we are just we are still going in completely the wrong direction we are completely in you know we're not in denial we recognize that the war on drugs is over even our prime minister accepts that but we have not taken the courage to look at a new solution and two we give the rhetoric of ha minimization we give the rhetoric of prevention but we do not put our dollars where our mouths are nor do we nor do we have the courage to actually bite the bullet and change the laws and I hope that that's something that I can prod to happen at least in Victorian Parliament and set that ball rolling nationally you know obviously people are kind of sore voting for the situation so I don't think it will change until Australia wakes up to itself and actually starts getting informed starts understanding that in other places in the world these things aren't an issue and it's just it's a waste of our time on negative things our country is amazing you know it could be so much more positive and one of these days I'm sure we'll see a campaign that's based on the fact that a lot of people who smoke cannabis feel disenfranchised they feel that the political system has let them down that they're still after all these years being the target of law enforcement when they should be law enforcement's got better things to do it's not really protecting us our laws in Australia ought to be relevant they ought to be functional they ought to be doing something what is the point in having laws that everybody knows people break it kind of it's just makes makes a bit of a laughingstock of the political and legal see stem and I don't think that helps anyone in this country I do think that if we want to have advanced drug law reform in the country well then we need to make sure we're bringing the population along with us and there is a compelling argument to legalize regulate and tax cannabis and we're seeing happen around the world but the big change has to come through legislation politicians have to know that it's politically safe for them to move on this issue they've got to know that hey the world is not going to fall apart in terms of their electorate their supporters walking away from them knocking about purity moving about the other person well if politicians know that their voters are supporting progressive change sensible change around the drug laws then that's terrific so whether you're mr. mrs. average or whoever you might be communicating your views about it about changing to the law and liberalizing the law and removing some of these ridiculous pro-business arms to your local member is a very useful activity that bob talk to you write them another they'll write your letter back have a million-dollar permitting with you getting across that it's an ordinary concern for ordinary people I think would be a very important task writing to your Member of Parliament seriously saying telling them about your drug use telling them about your life giving personalizing drug users that we are not those those guys breaking into our cars desperate to for heroin but we're not the people that are stealing to buy drugs we are the people that like to use alternatives to into alcohol or tobacco as a social tonic and politicians need to hear that they need to hear those personal stories that are good stories that I'm a student I'm a mum I'm a lawyer you know I'm a politician and I like smoking cannabis and I see nothing wrong with it there's actually a fantastic new organization in the United States called green flower media that has a campaign coming out green where they've got people who I've been very successful professionals or whatnot people couples who speaking about you know using cannabis in the context of the relationship that kind of thing people who have been successful in the world essentially talking about being cannabis users and they're an incredible it's an incredible set of videos it's very new it just started operating in the last month or so and I think that that kind of essentially coming out is a really important process that is Sigma tising cannabis use but the more people come out and talk about their own drug use the less stigma there will be and of course the less stigma there is the more people will be prepared to come out and I freely admit smoking marijuana and and taking other drugs recreationally I certainly recognize that I don't do that during work hours and that I do it as responsibly as I can do you smoke weed yes you've coming out here today yep I think because the more of us who do this the more we realize that it's it's not those victims in the street that are the drug users that ninety-nine point nine percent of the drug users are your work colleagues other people on the tram in the morning to going to work other people selling your popcorn at the movies you've got to learn the lessons from the immense failure of the war on drugs in the United States and make sure that we start learning those lessons and giving up the war on drugs in Australia politicians are now starting to recognize the war on drugs doesn't work should legalize it regulated and tax it and that sets up a relatively safe model that we can ensure that people get the right health warnings and safety warnings and it ensures that we can protect underage people from accessing it we can ensure the quality of the products that's on the market so we're not selling dodgy stuff that you know people are probably buying in the streets now it sounds an easy fix it is easy you just have to do it in the tens and hundreds of thousands that's the hard part there is there's still a lot of stigma and miss educated people out there but are they coming around yet is the cat out of the bag yeah it's not going back in get off their asses time to treat the module the political classes pump stopped making elections a joke the people in power need out both John your party whatever your design change their policy set them on fire we are the power but we have to take it your heart fostex attempt to fully bacon spend the money on it situation on its head create jobs

pM48aT2loV8,Australian Sloths Can Now Smoke Weed Legally!,2016-02-17T00:14:22Z,this week in weed australia has always had a very strict no tolerance policy and harsh punishments when it comes to illegal drugs but that is changing soon with the complete support of the people and both political parties lawmakers have decided to allow marijuana to be grown with the strict stipulation that it be for scientific and medical purposes only
LNyS5Eb9YYM,Explore Israel&#39;s Medical Cannabis Research With iCan,2016-03-31T18:00:01Z,"medical marijuana is already legal in several American states and the industry is raking in tons of money but American companies are still struggling with the science behind cannabis plants and now they're turning to Israel for help u.s. firms are increasingly farming out cannabis research and development to Israel the Jewish state is turning into an industry leader because of its highly developed agricultural technology and liberal approach to marijuana studies US investors still aren't sure how to make the most out of cannabis plants and they're turning to Israel to answer the question if you're in California or you're from State I'm from Colorado you're getting medical marijuana you're getting it from in a lot of cases somebody who did not graduate high school they're making your medicine there's no science there's no anecdotal evidence Israel's a leader in agriculture and then you take that in couple with a perla professor mr. Ullom dead and Hebrew University and continues to do and other researchers you have the two sites you have the plant sciences and you have the pharmaceutical development and real science in fact Hebrew University professor Raphael McCollum is considered by many to be a pioneer in the study of medical cannabis cannabis is very promising but it is difficult it's complicated and if some of the things that he can get into medical cannabis and make millions tomorrow morning it my understanding not so simple he has to be based on good science well maybe a good business practice and so on but which should be based on good science the US Drug Enforcement Administration has set strict rules that have prevented many needed cannabis studies especially since the US legal marijuana market earns about 5.7 billion dollars annually and is expected to grow to 23 billion by 2020 now Israeli leaders in the cannabis industry are taking on the booming market with full force by launching an annual conference called canna tech to focus on accelerating cannabis technology since 2014 US companies have invested about 50 million dollars in licensing is really medical marijuana devices and that number could double this year I see money in the room billions of dollars came to see what's going on in Israel and they unfortunately in two days we can only show the tip of the iceberg but it gets him excited enough to actually put their money behind what's going on in research here we find that the level of capital efficiency here is great there's an industrious group of people here what you could take and spend a half a million dollars on in the US you could usually get for 125 or 150 thousand dollars in Israel and it's going to be done efficiently and on time so I find that the quality of the research here is world-class the arbitrage of value is good even though marijuana is still an illegal substance in the Holy Land is really laws are liberal when it comes to research this lets growers work in close cooperation with scientific institutions to conduct clinical trials and develop a variety of strains to treat a range of illnesses and disorders they each to each trade even being a eventually cannabis may even be legal in Israel Health Minister Yaakov leadsmen has recently come out in support of medical cannabis usage in the Holy Land and has introduced steps to simplify and ease itself or medical uses so far 23,000 Israelis have permits from the Health Ministry to purchase medical cannabis and that number is expected to grow as Israel continues to take the lead in medical marijuana research we can only wonder what the future holds what kind of Israeli cannabis products can the world expect Sol K is a CEO of ICANN and this really company bringing cannabis products to the global market and he's here with more thanks for coming in thank you for having me so let's start with the big question why has Israel become such a leader in medical marijuana research it's been a leader for over 40 years essentially prohibition in the u.s. in the 1930s cut down alcohol and cannabis at the same time alcohol came back cannabis never did however in the 60s professor McCollum at Hebrew University asked to study the properties of the plant and discovered not only the properties of the plant but inside our body that we have a system ready to accept the can boy the cannabinoids that come from the plant and have healing properties so it's essentially just that the regulatory environment here is allowed right and so you've now started this new conference called kinetic and I think it's a second year right that's right and so tell us about it what what kind of response are you getting from the public amazing our idea was to bring innovation from Israel in the cannabis space to the world as we are a research leader we've had that ability 450 people came from all over the world 150 from outside of Israel to meet the top researchers and entrepreneurs and see what's happening on the ground as someone called the ground zero of cannabis research in Israel and that's what we wanted to show and together with that we've set up Israel's first private cannabis incubator where because of the logistical and regulatory issues of touching a plant which is so heavily regulated it's very hard to get new innovation in the space so we've actually set up a physical incubator where we can do testing inside Israel licensed together with one of our partners hearing is our one of the growers it's an amazing opportunity you guys can also connect investors innovators right so you know recreational marijuana use is illegal in Israel but medical marijuana is permitted and even encouraged what kinds of illnesses and and sicknesses has marijuana have been used to treat so we know the big ones cancer indeed decreases the nausea allows people to feel better while getting these horrible chemotherapy treatments Parkinson's ALS neurological diseases possibly shingles we're about to investigate in clinical trials things were revolving around the liver the kidneys of general pain everyone suffers from pain epilepsy we've seen a big push in the US with epilepsy medications specifically for children all of those are covered in Israel under the National basket of cannabis health and Crohn's disease a lot of the Ashkenazi tak diseases and also psychological disorders that's right PTSD depression and PTSD in Israel as a particular topic that's you know very close to heart because we live in a very high-stress environment our soldiers have a extremely high level of stress and PTSD unfortunately comes from that and there's a deep research showing not only can a treat but it can help to prevent in the first place absolutely so what kinds of symptoms and diseases do you think marijuana could treat in the future well because of the endocannabinoid system the system of receptors that we have in our body those receptors are pretty much found in every procedure in every organ so the the amount we can target cannabis medicine could be unknown but we know things like diabetes that it can revolutionize obesity there are so many opportunities obesity is a funny when you hear people joke around about munchies and things like that but right we can change the plan we can give you a very specific formulation of the ingredients inside the cannabis plant which will promote less eating rather than more ignorant we can tailor make your medicine for you on a genetic level so in your opinion what is the most interesting cannabis technology that's now being offered on the market especial from Israel and what's the coolest product that we're gonna see in the future so the product recently released release that kinetic was based on terpenes toppings of the flavor and the smell behind cannabis something you know and you you see in Camden Market and in Amsterdam but they have therapeutic effects as well so they've isolated those compounds and rebuilt them into a formulation which can enhance cannabis use especially in Israel where you're limited to the amount of cannabis that you get in the program having something can enhance effect and immensely help you to finish the month with your prescription medication interesting so what would you say now to critics of marijuana who claim you know it can be dangerous and impair your ability to function by smoking go back relearn everything you've learned the myths are all wrong my partner Jason suffers from chronic fatigue and the only medicine through all the pharmacological zahl that diet all the habits that we try to change the only thing that helped for chronic fatigue was medical cannabis so you expect medical cannabis to cause fatigue to make you you know into couch lock this does the exact opposite so it's such a broad range of compounds that can do so many things and we still need a lot of research and validation and of the data but that's why Israel is so important because we can do that here and it's the only place in the world that you can absolutely well you know you guys are doing a great job of trying to spread the message and and you know make people more aware of the medical uses of cannabis so great job and hope to see you again yeah canna Tech next year it's the place to be for cannabis innovation absolutely"
V0oQg1dbSuY,Medical Marijuana Legalised in Australia,2016-09-02T00:30:11Z,Australia will finally be legalizing medicinal marijuana in November the Therapeutic Goods Administration stated that medicinal cannabis will be removed from the prohibited substances list to the Controlled Drugs list clinical trials have shown moderate quality evidence that marijuana can help treat chronic pain there's still a lot of work to do on educating both people and doctors on prescribing it but at least this is one step forward for those who need it most it is time we this day come on news visit OC gossip calm today
XECZK857LcE,UC S18 E02 Legalising Marijuana Voxpop,2016-09-17T01:30:57Z,[Music] [Music] [Music] see this important bill now before it is too late it's been heavily debated where the marijuana should be legalized and used for medicinal purposes today we're hitting the streets of Perth to hear what people have to say about it there was a whole bunch of reasons why was made illegal in the first place and those reasons are really legitimate anymore why not as long as it's helping people for it yeah I mean this is not really easy any reason not to like most people agree with legalization I think now at least most young people if something is working and can be effective and can help reduce symptoms then you know I think it's definitely definitely a go but I know a problem with it if it relieves people's suffering like people have epilepsy or people dying at cancer or trying to deal with treatment I think if people are in pain and and suffer and there's something that can relieve that it's a good thing as long as it's controlled and given in a controlled environment yes I'm totally for that it can only help people I've seen a lot of documentaries on it and I can actually see that for medicinal purposes it's something that should really a lot more investigation needs to be done because I think it's it's can be a great thing perhaps you think maybe more research or more information raising the pros and cons yeah it's gonna be a good thing if got more trials and stuff homes people just see what actual good effects it can do I think there's not enough research on medicinal marijuana opposed to how much research has been put in tobacco and quite quite frankly I think tobacco should be illegal yeah exactly that's still illegal and we know that kills you it's the only thing that you if used by the directions on the packet it will kill you do you think marijuana is safer than alcohol or perhaps tobacco it's technically safer yeah it's way less addictive I think than alcohol and cigarettes I mean cigarettes is is not really any holistic sort of beneficial purpose to it it's just purely addiction it's definitely demonized a lot more than those two illegal substances even though they're both drugs anyway perhaps those things should be illegal and what are your thoughts about being legalized I'm well it's legally in Uruguay it's legally in Washington State Oregon I think and Colorado so if it's legal in some parts of the world and not others it's a bit strange but you look at all the people that died from car crashes that are contributed alcohol you compare that to amount of people who maybe get stoned I mean you shouldn't drive but alcohols far worse alcohol and smoking tobacco far worse best head drops for under County [Music] you
m6zIjSuwKr0,"Miss Mary Jane Wins Australia&#39;s First Medicinal Cannabis Pitch Festival, October 29 2016. Sydney",2016-11-09T03:39:41Z,today it's a huge education gap in our community that our solution is to engage with the public education to the professional personality within the social media platform and we want to build the influence through this short informative and sometimes your template humorous videos me and my partner have been patients and and activist for quite a few years we've been keeping across the changes in the states around cannabis and the market is happening there because I'm a medical patient myself I've realized that there's a lot of potential there and all the stats that we've seen coming from Colorado and Washington have really made us think that we'd like to get ever get out of our day jobs and do a job that helps people I have something called ankylosing spondylitis which is a form of spinal arthritis and I went for about six months of agony not being able to walk I'm not being able to move and I tried all sorts of other medical medicine and it did help and they helped but I found that I would easily get attached to them and start feeling bad symptoms so i tried medical cannabis and it worked great for it so i was convinced we liked everyone and we're just well we were quite concerned that it wasn't going to get a good reception so we were always a little bit hesitant to how much effort and how many videos you would put into it so now we know that it had such a good reception and over I'm so supportive of it and that there's a lot of other things to do that I think will probably be putting a bit more a bit more effort into it yeah it's quite a good affirmation what we're doing is appreciated and I think the prize is going to afford a sense of opportunities to network and collaborate and see I've really take it to where it could be that's really really yeah
yv3LsBL8PmA,New cannabis gel could ease epilepsy seizures,2016-11-02T04:38:49Z,"A world first trial of a cannabis gel, developed to  relieve epilepsy in adults, is underway in Melbourne. Rubbed onto the arms of patients, it helps prevent seizures in those with a drug resistant form of the condition. Eighteen-year-old Max Dalton is among the first epilepsy patients in the world to use cannabis gel. His seizures began two years ago. They know how cannabis  works so I'm happy to go on that, than kind of be taking a cocktail of other drugs. During seizures lasting around one minute,  Max loses his speech and memory, making it difficult for the stand-up comedian. If I was going for a job interview and I was scared that I was going to have a seizure during the interview. Max's seizures are caused by a lesion on his brain and he is among a third of all epilepsy sufferers who are resistant to existing drugs. They desperately need a better to control their seizures. The new cannabis gel does not contain any mind-altering ingredients and doctors believe by rubbing it in the arm the active part of the drug will be more effective and reach the brain sooner. By going directly to the skin which then gets absorbed without having to go through the liver, directly to the brain, so we're hoping we'll get a better concentration and more consistent concentration. Australia continues to lead the way with its medical marijuana trials. This is the first of its kind in the world  using cannabis gel in adult epilepsy patients Cannabis is meant to be quite safe and and this is a good form that doesn't make him high or anything like that. One hundred and eighty patients will use the gel twice daily for 12 weeks. Researchers at the Royal Melbourne Hospital expect to know if it works by the middle of next year. Karen O'Sullivan, 7 News"
1s-dDGTt20c,Dr Ethan Russo MD - 1 of 2 presentations,2016-06-08T11:59:58Z,"very very excited to introduce our our next speaker he's come all the way from the US of A and is doing a talk on the endocannabinoids system in health and disease Ethan Russo MD is a board-certified neurologist in psychopharmacology so and psychopharmacology researcher sorry and medical director of fight X a biotechnology company researching and developing innovative approaches targeting the human endocannabinoid system from 2003 to 2014 he served as a senior medical advisor and study position to GW Pharmaceuticals for 3 phase 3 clinical trials of Sativex but the alleviation of cancer pain unresponsive to opioid treatment and studies of epidural x for intractable epilepsy he has held faculty appointments in pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Montana in medicine at the University of Washington and as a visiting professor the Chinese Academy of Sciences he is a past president of the International cannabinoid Research Society and former chairman of the International Association for cannabinoid medicines he's an author of numerous books book chapters and articles on cannabis and ethnobotany and herbal medicine very looking forward to hearing what he has to say ladies and gentleman please put your hands together for dr. Ethan Russo what's a pleasure to be here I want to thank Lucy and Lou and all the organizers for this opportunity this talk is going to be somewhat technical I would remind you that this material will be available later so there will be things I'm talking over rather rapidly and that's not me being nervous but rather in the interest of time and hopefully just whetting your appetite for going onward you'll see my email here Ethan resort comcast.net I'd be happy to hear from you subsequently if you'd like materials sent to you about that these topics so we're talking about cannabis sativa but we're also going to explore how it works and this is through a thing called the endocannabinoid system among others the story begins with a plant called cannabis as you heard from Justin it makes glandular trichomes which you see those little balls on the end of stalks and those produce THC and the other cannabinoids and terpenoids in turn THC binds to cannabinoid receptors so your body has locks that have a key like THC or endogenous cannabinoids within the body that fit that receptor so they're also endogenous or endocannabinoids as you heard an and amide and to Erika Donal glyceride that bind to this cb1 receptor there are actually three kinds of cannabinoids phyto cannabinoids or the plant-based cannabinoids in general these are 21 carbon items from cannabis but there are also exceptions other plants beyond cannabis have beta carry awfully and that binds to a second cannabinoid receptor cb2 the endocannabinoids are again within the body this system has been described as having functions including relax eat sleep forget and protect and then there's synthetic cannabinoids some of which were developed before we knew about the receptors and some afterwards this simple schematic shows how these work in the brain very simply stated the endogenous cannabinoids are produced on demand when needed they're in the postsynaptic neuron the one on the bottom now whereas neurotransmitters go forward these go backward and they will lodge on the cb1 receptor where their main function in the brain is to reduce the release of neurotransmitters so they are damping down whatever function that particular nerve saw had as we heard this is a system that's found throughout the animal world incor dates things that have a back backbone and so the endocannabinoid system itself has three components the endogenous cannabinoids themselves their receptors cb1 and cb2 - mentioned and also a third called the ionotropic cannabinoid receptor trpv1 that's where capsaicin the active ingredient in Chili Peppers works and it also includes their enzymes the ones that make them and break them down because they can be manipulated pharmacologically and serve as medicines as well as you've heard previously there's an entourage effect we have the main players - AG and nanda might but additionally there are a series of other compounds that the are found in the body that on their own don't do a lot but will synergize with this and what's called the entourage effect so in a sense we have soloists and we have supporting cast in terms of the cb1 cannabinoid one receptor in the brain it's found in many places particularly in areas that are no susceptance or belem of the limbic system involved with emotion the basal ganglia with movement and also in reward pathways so the relationships of this system to how addictive drugs or other things that are addictive like sex and food also affect the system now although there are certain areas in the brainstem like the substantial the periaqueductal gray that have to do with pain they are not in areas of the medulla that mediate respiration so whereas opioids cause death by people stopping breathing because of depression of the respiratory center this cannot happen with the cannabinoid no no matter how potent it is and hence there's an inherent safety in comparison to the opioids but it's not just the brain where these work they also work throughout the spinal cord in the periphery in the gut it's important that you know that the cb1 receptor is the most abundant receptor g-protein coupled receptor in the brain and again as mentioned it modulates the function of the various neurotransmitters if we have a system like glutamine glutamate I'm sorry that it's normally stimulatory and is overactive and neuropathic pain if the cannabinoids damp down that response you see how that reduce the pain over time so in the brain again this system modulates pain memory movement whether someone will vomit or not their seizure threshold but also uh many other functions in the body including in the gut I like to say that the brain in the gut speak the same language cannabinoids modulate the propulsion how fast things move through the gut and the secretion how much liquid or lack of liquid there is it might interest you to know that one of the first treatments for cholera terrible kind of diarrhea in the 19th century was cannabis quite successfully I mentioned that there's an additional receptor cb2 if we think of cb1 as being the psychoactive receptor that causes it explains the psychoactive effect of THC there additionally is cb2 that's mainly found out in the body where it mediates pain and inflammation but a drug that would only affect it would not produce a high these drugs that would affect cb2 would be very promising and treating various fibrotic diseases diseases that cause scarring in the liver or other organs additionally we've got both kinds of receptors in the skin and this is a particularly interesting area therapeutically in that it's very accessible you don't have to get through a lot of layers to have this be active and this is an area of quite a bit of current research interestingly cannabidiol which doesn't bind to these particular receptors with any affinity also seems to be a great drug for the skin and a full spectrum cannabis extract that had it would show antibacterial effects like in acne but additionally we know the cannabidiol works on yet another receptor called trip v4 and reduces the release of fat sebum that contribute to acne now if we look at other areas in the body you see this heartless person we need to change this diagram because actually a cannabis and cannabinoids work on the hardest wall of course the bones that don't drop so well on this person either cannabidiol for instance was recently shown to stimulate bone fracture healing and although cannabinoids are banned from professional and amateur sports it may be in the future that when an athlete breaks his or her leg that they get cannabidiol to speed the healing just briefly to look at the heart again may be very familiar to you that when someone tries cannabis for the first time they may get a very rapid heart rate some of that is the excitement of the experience but additionally there's a pharmacological effect interestingly at a higher dose the heart will actually slow down it may slow down so much that the person can't maintain their blood pressure and will pass out from what's called orthostatic hypotension in the past there's been concerned that there were studies that showed some people that had heart attacks may have smoked cannabis within a short period of time but epidemiologically looking at the sum total of cases this is not an area where we have cannabis being responsible for a lot of heart attacks and an individual that could have an effect um but again no strong signal this one's been pretty much debunked for some time it was thought that there could be this cannabis arteritis this would be a swelling of an artery such that blood can get through and you see a constriction right well this is not strong enough to show but the radiologists in the audience will pick out the point of blockage in fact when this is carefully examined by my colleague from Jotunheim and it was shown that all these people that had this so-called cannabis are to rice arteritis also were smoking tobacco which is known in certain individuals with a thing called Buerger's disease to constrict the blood vessels and produce problems of this type now as you well aware the most common use of cannabis therapeutically is treating in chronic pain conditions and the way it does this is really quite multifactorial and these are just a few of the ways in which it does it some are on neurotransmitters some are through interactions with opioids whether they're taken by pill or the endogenous opioid system they're also direct effects in the brain and other components in cannabis beyond cannabidiol and THC the brain actually has a baseline level of endocannabinoid function it's called the endocannabinoid tone so it's always at about this level and under certain conditions there could be less activity or more activity the endocannabinoids system is active in an area of the brain called the periaqueductal gray for example this is a migraine generator I'll be talking about that more in a bit it's also active in an area called the thalamus the ventral posterolateral nucleus and if we test their cannabinoids are ten times more powerful and reducing pain than morphine is so quite why using the two together might be useful in a lot of clinical situations additionally there are many mechanisms in the spinal cord by which cannabinoids treat chronic pain and you see some of the mechanisms listed here wind up in allodynia it may be that your doctor has trouble with these terms we're not going to go into a lot of detail today but I'd be happy to send you a book chapter about this that explains better additionally this again works out in the periphery and can work on things like contact dermatitis from an eruption if someone's exposed to poison ivy or the like and just plain old itch now I realize that these things are too small for you to read but you may hear from people particularly politicians that they're know controlled trials of cannabis I'm treating this or that condition well this is quite false this is just a listing of a few randomized controlled trials just of Nixon moles which is the US adopted name for sativex which is available in 27 countries for treatment of spasticity multiple sclerosis oddly it was approved in Australia but hasn't been available because of problems with cost and the fact that Novartis that owns the rights to it is not chosen to market it here so this is a problem again as you've heard from medicine isn't accessible due to cost or politics then it's no good to patients but what I wanted to illustrate is beyond the use in multiple sclerosis they've been all these clinical trials almost all positive in treating chronic pain conditions with this agent unfortunately there haven't been the corresponding studies in any respect anywhere near as much for other forms of cannabis the smoke and vaporized cannabis clinical trials only amount to three patient years that means one person using cannabis daily for three years or 300 using for a much shorter period of time in comparison sativex the randomized controlled trials there and monitoring is over 6,000 patient years so obviously a big big difference just to go over a few of the clinical trials on these are in cancer pain studies they've been two of these published one was for two weeks in a hospice population in Europe and the other was for five weeks and it was done in many countries around the world including patients in Australia which is the reason I previously visited you for a short time there's also been a long-term extension where people with cancer survived longer and continued the medicine had their observations added what was interesting there was for the people gained pain control it did not subside over time normally we expect people to increase their opioid dose that didn't happen and they didn't increase their Sativex dose either and although a lot of the patients subsequently succumbed they did not have an increase in their pain levels so showing the utility in the long term so again as I mentioned the first trial was two weeks they used to think called the numeric rating scale what's your pain on a scale of 0 to 10 comparing Sativex to placebo and they looked at various things including responder analysis which is a way of looking at how someone did over the long term not just in an individual day but what were the overall trends the gold standard in pain is the group that has a 30% decrease in pain over time that's highly significant in the pace and that was 43 percent of the patients on sativex versus 21 percent on placebo and the probability of that happening due to chance is only six in a thousand so that's quite statistically significant now if we look at the 30 percent level here you see something very interesting because this was a three part study they looked at placebo just regular drugs they're opioids because these patients were all resistant had pain despite the best that medicine could provide morphine or other drugs for pain and had these things he added in so they had placebo added in they had tetran Avonex added in that's a high THC extract full-spectrum but no cannabidiol and that's in blue placebos and grey the orange is Sativex the only difference between the blue that didn't work compared to placebo and the orange is the addition of cannabidiol so this is the first salient demonstration of the synergy of cannabidiol with THC and the other components in the plant in pink control and again this is a continuous response analysis so we're looking at the trends over time and you see that the pain goes down in the gray you've got the placebo unfortunately placebo works it works a lot on we'll go into this more in the talk tomorrow it works all too well so you can have a drug that actually is quite effective but if the placebo works too well you won't show it's statistically significant difference and it's a negative trial just like the drug with no good even if it might be but you see basically in all the time points in this the Phase two studies of which were done over five weeks internationally the there were it was always a little better than placebo and again statistically significant and looking at the two studies their probability values as compared to placebo both show improvement to a significant degree and now let's shift into a little bit about clinical trials of new pics and moles sativex and multiple sclerosis unfortunately there's only been one study formally in spasticity in recent times with smoked cannabis and it was effective but very short duration limited number of patients in comparison you see this whole listing of a series of clinical trials again almost all being effective the study that finally proved things so that approval could happen in 27 countries was this one on this is what's called a randomized withdrawal study and if you look at the graph initially unbeknownst to the patients everyone got sativex and used the amount that would either help with their spasticity muscle tightness or gave them too many side effects after a month only the patients who improved 20% were then continued in the study and they were then randomized they came in for a resupply visit half the patients got the same number of sprays in the mouth of Sativex a day that they'd taken before and half got placebo instead again they didn't know who was who but you see the differences the lines converge I'm sorry diverge the people were getting sativex afterwards continued to have a decrease in their spasticity levels were those that when a placebo actually got worse and then leveled out again you'll see a listing of complex neuro physiological mechanisms of Sativex on spasticity I'm not going to bore you with those details today but suffice it to say you can study this when you have time and these are quite important here's just a little graphic demonstration the person on the left on the picture has what's called a coin of varus it's a because of spasticity the foot is in this funny position but after treatment with THC CBD which is sativex they don't mention that the terpenoids are there as well but the feet look the same and they have relaxed so again this was done in patients who had previously taken muscle relaxants the approved drugs for this condition but didn't have adequate results now luceat asked me to talk about theory i developed and published in 2004 called clinical endocannabinoid deficiency and i'll again apologize that some of this is pretty technical but i can tell you that everything that we have on these slides is in a big new review article that's been provisionally accepted when I get home I need to do a couple of little revisions and then hopefully it'll be published in the next couple of months and it'll be open source it'll be available to anyone but the idea of this is I mentioned the endocannabinoid tome this baseline level of activity everybody has one I don't know what yours is well what yours is but it's there somewhere this is a reflection of how much and dodging is cannabinoid there might be in your brain and other areas of the body how they're produced how they're broken down and how many receptors you have so a change in any of those could affect someone's level of pain or stiffness in the muscles or their seizure threshold the theory was that in certain conditions whether you're born this way or because of something that happens in your life that the endocannabinoid tone gets too low and that's going to produce disease and symptoms so that's the theory now in the original paper in 2004 I focused on three areas migraine fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome but there were a whole bunch of other conditions that I thought could be related to this and you see those listed there and they extend from hyperemesis gravidarum which is like morning sickness on steroids and a bunch of other conditions many psychiatric as well or so-called psychiatric I should say now there's some interesting reasons to think why those three conditions at the top are related they're all hyper lg6 state states in which the person seems to have an excess pain response um but when you look at the tissue it looks normal somebody with fibromyalgia when you do muscle biopsies you don't see anything special and there's no lab test for them so they're all clinical diagnosis a diagnosis based on the patient's described pattern they're also what are called comorbid they means that if you've got one there's a good chance you've got the other two so primary headache occurred in ninety seven percent of of 201 patients with fibromyalgia and then 36 percent of people who had chronic daily headaches which is a kind of daily migraine had fibromyalgia thirty-two percent of patient with irritable bowel had fibromyalgia and 32 percent of fibromyalgia patients had irritable bowel syndrome so this big overlap unfortunately attitudes haven't changed very fast because if we have a patient that had all three it's typically a woman seeing a male physician who's going to diagnose her as having a somatization disorder which is a modern way of saying that she's a hypochondriac I maintain to you that this is no such thing but this is a biochemical disorder and it might have something to do with not having enough to endogenous cannabinoids activity so let's hone in on these conditions first we'll do irritable bowel this is often thought of it's a lifelong condition but people clearly acquire this some people will have bad oysters they have diarrhea for three weeks and then they've got this condition continuing and they do bacterial cultures and everything else they find nothing and they're stuck with this condition and it can go on forever it's the most frequent diagnosis amongst gastroenterologist in the States and for all I know the same is likely true here there are no particular physical signs but pattern of irregular bowel movements often diarrhea although it can be constant constipation and they can alter knee you know people go through colonoscopies and blood tests including for gluten on neuropathy most often these are all negative but it's been described as a disorder of unknown origin is being treated by agents with an unknown mechanism of action there are a lot of drugs for this that don't work really well as anybody who's had this condition nodes and so maybe they're barking up the wrong pharmacological tree and the target should be the endocannabinoid system and instead patients who have this have gut pain almost all the time and things that shouldn't hurt hurt a lot if there's an area in the intestine that's distended too big it hurts and that's called the visceral hypersensitivity and again this overabundance of pain this worked by smeared it all was done in Australia I'm happy to say they looked at the muscles in the gut from surgical specimen specimens these weren't necessarily patients who had they may have had a variety of conditions but what they found was that an and amide co-localize with cholinergic neurons that's the primary mover of the gut but it was clear that it performed a modulatory role on how fast or how slowly things go through the gut what they suggested was the endocannabinoid system seemed to be upregulated in diseases that produced inflammation in the gut and that certainly would be true of irritable bowel as well this is a study where they looked at your Nabin all synthetic THC in 52 normal patients and basically showed that it produced changes in tone and pressure in the gut so just basically proof that this does have a role there some research done at the Mayo Clinic actually two studies they were looking at genetic markers of irritable bowel syndrome they found of this thing called CNRI which has to do with cannabinoid function that patients who had increase frequency of stools with irritable bowel responded to THC similarly in the second study that the cb1 receptor seemed to modify the speed through the gut so again just a gloss over that now there's some interesting relationships to diet I know we're here to talk about cannabis but it's important that you understand too that what you eat also has an effect on this and if you eat the right things you might not need cannabis as much so I'm interested in cannabis being utilized pharmacologically I'm also interested in patients getting better and it may be that both are needed this is a study that looked at lactobacillus so this is what's in yogurt these are normal inhabitants of the healthy gut and what they showed was this gene that has to do with the cannabinoid receptor cb2 its expression of RNA was affected by taking this as a supplement and this actually enhanced the pain reducing properties of morphine and it was opposed if you took a cb2 antagonist a drug that would reduce that function in this study they looked at probiotics those include lactobacilli yogurt and the like or kefir and they looked at studies where probiotics were taken as supplements and 32 at 34 out of 42 trials showed a beneficial effect on irritable bowel symptoms so they had less pain less bloating and dumb and some other functions and over five to six months taking lacto lactic acid bacteria produced a stabilization of the bacteria in the gut so they did cultures on those a very recent study looked at a phenomenon that's previously been reported everyone knows that cannabis with THC increases appetite so why aren't people use it regularly all fat as you'd expect the archetype of the hippie is a skinny guy who uses cannabis not a fat guy who uses cannabis so we have a bit of contradiction but in fact THC altered the bacterial balance and the gut this is done in mice but likely the same thing happened is in humans and there are two kinds of bacteria that are important called firma communities and Bacteroides but what happened and the key point here is in these mice that have a genetic predisposition to being obese that THC prevented weight gain through this change in the balance of bacteria okay so supplemental THC in the form of cannabis can have this effect and with diet in addition and maybe all the better so we've heard about probiotics they're also prebiotics prebiotics are vegetable matter that feeds the good bacteria their preferred food in the gut the chemicals involved with this are called inulin and fructooligosaccharides are Foss fort these don't get broken down in the stomach and they're fermented by these gut bacteria and there are over a thousand species and again the balance that this person has and that person has is going to be quite different when people have these vegetables that I'll show you in their diet it stimulates the growth and activity of the bifida bacteria and the lactobacilli that are good for the health it's estimated that ancient humans had a lot more of these vegetables in their diets than we do today we're a french fry may be considered a vegetable but it's not one of the ones you want for this so modern humans might only have a few grams a day of these the best sources are these acacia fiber gum arabic chicory burdock sunchokes and a lot of those are probably unfamiliar to you but hopefully onions leek and garlic might be in your diet when these are eaten they reduce infectious diarrhea they alleviate inflammatory bowel diseases they reduce cancer risk in the gut on the increase absorption of minerals lower cardiac risk and decrease obesity so that's quite a list of things that you can do with this minor dietary change to focus on money agent which is acacia fiber which is available commercially this is comes from the SAP of a tree in Africa acacia Senegal it's a premier prebiotic so this isn't digested it serves as food for those bacteria there was a trial done where they looked at this 10 grams a day which would be like a big heaping tablespoon full of this stuff that can be mixed into food or a smoothie or juice and that increase the lactobacilli six-fold compared to water and and it also increased this back to royalties balance it seemed to reduce Clostridium difficile which isn't in a gut bacterium when it it's often a hospital-acquired infection and when somebody's got it they could have diarrhea for years until it's taken care of and just an array of the prebiotics of includes dandelion greens you've got the acacia on the top left son truths or glute Jerusalem artichokes burdock root which is popular in oriental cuisines and then the familiar of leek garlic and onions all of this material is in an article that was just published I just got word yesterday published online I'd happy to be send to you now we're going to transition into fibromyalgia this is a study by Schley at all they looked at nine patients with fibromyalgia which is a painful disease of the muscles and they took THC up to fifteen milligrams a day oddly in Germany their Ethics Committee wouldn't let them use a placebo God knows why but because THC on its own is a very problematic drug without those added entourage compounds in cannabis that make it more acceptable on a side effect standpoint five and nine dropped out so only four took all of it all for the entire duration but they had a decrease in elodie neo which is touch feeling like burning pain or this overreaction to pain called hyperalgesia on he had reduction in pain overall that was statistically significant if we look at that graphic form the chances that this could happen due to chance would be only 1 in 100 so that's statistically significant NAB alone is a semi synthetic THC it's marketed in some countries it's about 10 times the potency of THC so not good from an acceptability standpoint to patients they looked at 40 patients that got nab alone one twice a day which would be about the same as xx THC so it's a pretty high dose actually after four weeks they looked at visual analogue scales where the patient judged their pain a thing called the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire and their anxiety levels and all of those were statistically improved but it wasn't a drug that patients typically can take over the lung a long period of time with any success our friend Mark where in Canada looked at NAB alone compared amitriptyline which is one of the standard drugs taken for fibromyalgia and they just looked at sleep and in fact in that study although sleep was improved and that's one of the hallmarks of fibromyalgia sleep disturbance it's always they are 100 percent on patient won't get better until that's dealt with so it is important to get this sleep and cannabinoids can help however in this study there was no benefit on the pain this was actually a study done with smoked cannabis in Spain in patients with fibromyalgia but it was only done acutely they looked at pain stiffness relaxation sleepiness and well-being 28 patients with cannabis 20 controls and after 2 hours those parameters with the asterisks were all statistically in however the mental health component summary was also hiring the people that got cannabis meaning that they had psychoactive side effects in this instance we can be almost positive this is a high THC variety with no cannabidiol because that's what was around in Spain at the time now I'm not usually big on surveys but this one's fascinating this wasn't in a thing called the National pain report that was done a couple of years ago they looked at 1,300 patients with fibromyalgia and they asked for their benefits from taking three Food and Drug Administration approved drugs duloxetine mill NASA Fran and pregabalin and red means they had no benefit green means it was very effective in yellow helps a little and you'll see a lot of red for the approved drugs compared to cannabis where over 60% had a really good result it was very effective and only 5% had no benefits so I asked you what's the better drug for treating fibromyalgia sort of no contest now we're going to move into migraine and all again apologize the that some of this is pretty technical but for a common condition migraine is probably the most biochemically complex Afflick affliction of people i've been spending my entire professional career trying to understand it and treat it this looked at women with migraine and they were looking at a thing called the ananda my membrane transporter and the activity of Fah Fah is fatty acid and my hydrolase that breaks down an and amide in the body they looked at platelets in the blood because we can't take samples of the brain and living patients isn't approved by ethics and the compared patients with chronic headaches versus controls and interestingly the levels of cb1 were equivalent in the platelets of the two groups but the women with migraine had an increased degradation rate of an and amide and decreased platelet levels that could indicate a deficiency that was contributing to the migraine ah I've got more of these ackerman at all did a series of studies again looking at endocannabinoid function in migraine one of the things that migraine does is make blood vessels too big or too small that's not the cause of the disease it's what's called an epiphenomenon a secondary effect an and amide reduced blood vessel diameter in the dura the covering the brain 30% and work for a complex biochemical mechanism and it was felt on the basis of all this stuff that an and amide has a tonic level of activity again a baseline level of activity and modifies a thing called the trigeminal vascular system which is the path of physiological mechanism migraines another study on blood vessels again showing involvement of the trip v1 subset of endocannabinoid receptors and a third also this is a synthetic cannabinoid called when looking at the synaptic activity and it suggested that cb1 agonist read THC or things like it have therapy therapeutic potential and migraine and cluster headache although the authors as many authors are this kind of literature were fearful of the psychoactive side-effects however that neglects the fact that often a very low dose that is in psychoactive is sufficient to treat these disorders or that you can mitigate the side effects of THC through the presence of cannabidiol or terpenoids probably the best piece of evidence that's come down the line of this theory of clinical endocannabinoid deficiency is on this slide this is a study I proposed in 2004 but in the United States I realized that we could never get this through an ethics committee because what I suggested was looking at cerebrospinal fluid levels of the endocannabinoids in patients with migraine and this isn't normally tested this requires a lumbar puncture a spinal tap so-called but what they did in this study is looked at normals how they got them to agree to have a spinal tap is beyond me but this was done in Italy maybe they were more convincing with their ethics but you see the level on the left in the controls is compared to that on the right and the patients with chronic migraine and there's a one chance in 10,000 that this result was done a chance this is real this is as good as being biopsy proven so what the author said was reduced in an amide levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of chronic migraine migraine patients support the hypothesis of the failure of this endogenous cannabinoids system in chronic migraine and then they went on to state how this worked but basically this is proof of the theory I believe more studies from Italy both to AG and an an amide both of the major end ok a monoid levels were markedly reduced in the platelets of migraine chronic migraine patients as compared to controls again very highly statistically significant another study out of Italy this is actually an animal model of migraine one of the things that can do is produce these bizarre century phenomenon like scintillating scotoma t'as that's a way of saying that you lose vision on one side and you've got sparkles there and it comes about due to a depression on the surface of the brain in this animal model they were able to show that this that the end annoyed endocannabinoid system is involved and presumably agents like THC and cannabis could prevent this and many patients report this if they have this aura of migraine with this sensory phenomenon they can use cannabis right away and prevent the attack from becoming full-blown there is a genetic predisposition to migraine this has been mapped to be related to cb1 gene C and R 1 which is on chromosome sex and interestingly the patients have the strongest evidence for this gene also had the highest likelihood of having migraine phenomena like sensitivity of the eyes to light nausea and significant disability with their headaches and for anybody who's had one they know about also there were some so-called personality traits including neuroticism whatever that is depression and a tendency towards drug dependence were higher in these patients but someone who has this chronically is obviously going to be trying to treat it with one substance or another this was just out a couple of months ago this is from Colorado now this is a biased sample these are patients that went to a clinic where they used cannabis and there were 120 patients with migraine and they were treated prophylactically on an ongoing preventive basis with cannabis 68% of used cannabis previously so it's not everyone you couldn't generalize this necessarily but the patients who then went on to use cannabis regularly they drop their attack rate from 10 point for a month to four point six a month which is again very highly significant they also had reduced headache frequency and we're able to abort or stop their headaches when they use it acutely again this is a selected population we need to do the same thing in randomized control trials I've been trying for 20 years and it still hasn't happened my friend John McPartland wrote what I call the article of the decade called the care and feeding the endocannabinoid system which i think is also the article title of the decade he looked at the issue of clinical and OU cannabinoid deficiency and listed these other authors whose work in these different conditions also seemed to be supportive of the concept and in the paper that I hope is going to be published soon we go into some of these areas and detail so something to look forward to where do we go from here with this concept clearly we need better studies of irritable bowel fibromyalgia migraine of looking at things like levels in the blood maybe in this cerebral spinal fluid it'd be better to do this with scans of the brain but right now we don't have great tools this way there is active research so that'd be great if you could go in and assess your endocannabinoid function or how dense your cannabinoid receptors in the brain without having a needle stuck in your back additionally we need better work genetically are there are companies now looking at markers for these diseases and trying to correlate them with endocannabinoid function what we really need the only thing is that going to convince physicians and politicians is controlled clinical trials of cannabis based medicines in these conditions preferably with enriched designs like I showed for sativex in spasticity this was the last paragraph from the paper in 2004 lv2 only time and the scientific method will ascertain whether a new paradigm is applicable to human physiology and the treatment of its derangements our insight into these possibilities is dependent on the contribution of one unique healing plant for clinical cannabis has become a therapeutic compass to what modern medicine fails to cure so last slide it is critical to understand that cannabis is a plant that modulates the endocannabinoid system which itself is an innate homeostatic regulator of human physiology if there's too much of something it brings it back into balance too little of something it brings it up into balance cannabidiol is a particularly promising therapeutic endocannabinoid system modulator so in the future we should have more event maybe just a little THC the endocannabinoid system also is influenced by lifestyle and dietary factors primary among these would be low impact exercise on anti-inflammatory antioxidant diet and things like the probiotics and prebiotics which seem to be a proven value in the conditions we've discussed so with that I'll close my first talk and thank you for your attention thank you very much dr. Ethan drew sir you"
5tBxTQSYN-Q,Dr Elizabeth Thiele on medicinal cannabis in TSC Epilepsy,2016-09-15T03:08:05Z,this whole roll of cannabinoids in the treatment of epilepsy and this is also very similar to the history of dietary therapy and I think if you look at dietary therapy in this it's fairly humbling that these are not new concepts these are concepts that have been talked about for thousands of years so just looking really quickly if the history of this cannabis has really been used for thousands of years it was the first non food crop yielding crop in China and it was cultivated for garments bowstrings paper in medicine and one of the first reference was in 20 700 BCE so few years ago where is recommended for menstruation gout rheumatism malaria constipation other ailments and then 1200 BC the Egyptians used it for glaucoma inflammation and enemas and medical use is also documented in ancient India Africa Greece Rome in the Arab world so pretty widespread utilization of cannabis and the treatment different ailments I in epilepsy is actually first mentioned in Sumerian texts these are stone tablets from 20 200 BCE that cannabis was used to treat nocturnal epilepsy and then kind of from the middle of kind of this is Middle East now these countries at 1100 nasal treatment of cannabis leaf for seizures and then kind of morred the regular use of cannabis for seizures if you come more kind of more current times in 1842 O'Shaughnessy reported cannabis reduced infantile convulsions and other disorders in an 1878 was also the report of cannabis leading to seizure freedom and a ten-year-old boy who had focal epilepsy in 1881 William Gower's and this should be of great significance to the neurologic community because galleries is one of our most famous historical figures in Neurology reported that cannabis had been recommended for epilepsy by russell reynolds in 1961 is sometimes though not frequently useful and then he actually administered cannabis and wrote about this in many cases with the affected laying paroxysms and mitigating the severity in some individuals in 1851 in the u.s. dispensary cannabis compound were suggested for several disorders including neuralgia depression hemorrhoids pain relief muscle spasm convulsive disorders and other ailments in an eighteen sixty the Ohio Medical Society on cannabis the efficacy was claimed for infantile convulsions epilepsy and many other disorders and then things changed and I think we can thank my country for this in 1911 in the setting of prohibition Massachusetts which Lisa I was shocked by this we consider our estate kind of liberal were blue Massachusetts was the first day to outlaw cannabis in the setting of prohibition and the other states quickly followed on marijuana prohibition laws and in 1970 the United States control substance act passed classifying marijuana is a drug with no accepted medical use so isn't that shocking after thousands of years of evidence that this might be a treatment suddenly in setting and because of prohibition it's decided not but things have been changing in 1996 and I think this started all of this now concept of medical marijuana in 1996 California became the first state united states to legalize medical marijuana in his earlier this year it was legalized in 23 states regulated the state level which makes it complicated and interesting but difficult and they're kind of had been easing increasing anecdotal reports about the efficacy of medical marijuana especially CBD and rich formulations in the treatment of refractory epilepsy now I've never smoked marijuana but I'm extremely interested in it it's a complicated plan over 500 chemicals I'm THC there is the only plant that contains these cannabinoids and what's interesting to me about it is our brains have receptors for cannabinoids so why this plant has these chemicals that our brains have receptors for has been intriguing to me THC is a cannabinoid that's the one that has psychoactive properties cannabidiol has no psychoactive properties nestled when it's thought to be potentially effective in epilepsy so about two and a half years ago now with this increasing anecdotal thing over the web social media people using this a group of 55 academic centers including us got together the company in the UK GW Pharma which many of you have heard from heard of that have products they had a cannabidiol and we decided to ask the United States government the FDA and DEA for mission to put kids on this to see if it was effective in order to do this we i was allowed initially 25 i now have 56 kids under this ind we had to write little stories about each kid did the DEA and fda showing that these kids were with the most highly refractory epilepsy we had they've been on 10 medications most it had either surgery had been on diet had the stimulator and still having seizures per day sharing these kids really don't have options they need to have the opportunity to try this of that because I had this big interest in tsc and epilepsy I initially Shea had five now I have 16 patients with THC and cannabidiol under this expanded access I and II all of them again with the most highly refractory epilepsy of my epilepsy patients and we have done interim analysis on 10 and this is going to be presented at the epilepsy meetings in a couple weeks average age is 11 kind of more boys than girls many with the tsc to mutation and what is looked at nipple FC trials now is called the responder rate and that is what percentage of people have a fifty percent or greater reduction of seizures that's a responder and kind of then also obviously interested in side effects because this is really safety tolerability is that well as efficacy found that there can be diarrhea and that's because it's in an oil so with the more volume of oil sometimes diarrhea and then very important also to know is there can be significant drug interactions particularly with clobazam as well as valproate and important the united states no because many people are putting their kids i'm very different for variations of medical marijuana and a lot of these kids are on these drugs and if they're not followed levels aren't follow than this isn't appreciated the kids can have pretty significant difficulty with profound lethargy change in liver functions etc but anyway what we see is it can be really helpful into yes and this is over the response rate of these different months but i think if you look here at the 12 months the fact that these kids there's a greater fifty to sixty percent respond ring and again remember these are my most refractory epilepsy patients so anything that can reduce their seizures by 50% to me is pretty wicked exciting and one of the kids a seizure free after two months and this is kid i've known on and off for years she had epilepsy surgery with this years ago moved away came back of a year and a half ago and her brothers came with her brother say you have to help Marissa we've lost her and at that point Marissa was completely basically not interactive she was having continuous a typical absence seizures so we put her on the epidural extender expanded access I mean she's been completely seizure free for nine months now it's going on a year I mean actually she comes back now you cannot shut the kid up and so her mom is like now she's really driving me crazy because she's like chatty Kathy I like this I like they know but anyway so it's been pretty incredible for her and in addition to seizure control we've had parent reported improvements in alertness robel capacity communication vocalizations cognitive ability initiation of emotional and physical connections now this you have to take very cautiously because one of the concerns about this there's such hype in the United States for possible medical marijuana that we know there could be a huge placebo effect if I put my kid on this I have such great hope that this is going to work that I can see my child no longer be autistic you no longer be anything and so that's why the randomized controlled trials are so important but based on our stuff on the ind on these TS kids GW Pharma has announced they've filed with the united states and these will be international studies that there will be TSE specific studies with cannabidiol and they will be starting soon and there is great interest they have and kind of they have talked to John about possibly there being a site in Australia so I think you guys could be hopeful that hopefully there will be a site here for the study the inclusion criteria will be a pretty broad age range and I was really excited about that that will include not only children but also adults well documented seizure history diagnosed with tsc stable and all medications because when you go into trawl you want to see what your study drug is able to do no changes during the trial no medical marijuana or cannabis based trials during the trial so that makes sense and then baseline to include greater than eight seizures during a baseline period the exclusion criteria or the pit folks have had pseudo seizures because it's going to be hard to track what's a real seizure and what's not illness or anesthesia in four weeks prior surgery for epilepsy six months prior if they're on Philbert all if they're on an mtor inhibitor and part of the reason for that is the mtor inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for epilepsy you cannot be on to investigational drugs at once so even if a person is on an important hibbett ER for renal AML would exclude them from this trial the topical rabba myosin honestly should not because that does not get absorbed hit paddock dysfunction suicidal thoughts and that's true for any seizure trial right now and then any use of recreational marijuana and kind of what's going to happen with this is there will be a four-week baseline so folks will enroll then to baseline so you can track seizures over that time for week initiation of drug 12-week observation and it will be a one-third placebo one third one dose of CBD another third a higher dose of CBD no one knows we don't know people don't know what they're on and then at the end of that that observation phase anyone can go into open-label phase and then everyone will get drugged so again these are the things that will be measured but I think that there in the United States and I know kind of increasingly around the world there's a lot of interest and excitement and this is not the silver bullet for epilepsy and tis not the silver bullet for epilepsy and anything but I think it's a very safe and well-tolerated medication and I know it can be helpful to some people and so with that I'd like to stop and down thank you various guys very much you yes welcome it's great to to be having this meeting again this is the third similar meeting I think that we've held with as combines scientific stream and or medical stream and and patient stream patient and family stream back in two thousand in this part of the world that is back in 2007 David Franz came and was at that stage telling us all about the exciting stuff that was happening in cincinnati with with mtor inhibitors and Chris kingswood was talking about kidneys and his experience with kidneys in 2011 we had Petrus devries talking about that the neurological cognitive psychological things that we all call tan now and Vicki Whitmer bit picky Whitmore from the NIH giving a bigger picture view of of research and and cooperation between families and science and and David friends came back and then this year we're moving on and looking differently and we've got Lisa and Elizabeth with lamb and and neurological and epilepsy and again the really exciting thing is both our world leaders are truly world leaders international experts like our previous speakers and so it's a great privilege to have them here today and we the program as you can see we're sort of trying to expand out a bit we're looking at the at TS is an intergenerational condition and particularly in the next session in the medical stream looking at really from preconception through the whole life cycle and a whole or all the issues that are involved and not just the traditional things about managing your seekers and you're a mls but much more of a holistic view of the patient i think i think we're today with there are a few medical students here i think a few were registered and it's great for them i think this is a great opportunity for them because tsc in a ways is an exemplar of a 21st century medicine and how it works and and if I don't think medical students use textbooks anymore but if any of them were to pick up a textbook you know it from the 20th century the text books of tsc was that textbook picture of that child with tuberous sclerosis and now we know that tessa is so much more so much a spectrum of manifestations across all different ages and we know that through some great research and cooperation between basic scientists that are here today through to clinicians collaboration between multidisciplinary teams collaboration between pediatrics and adult medicine and we've got representatives of them here across state boundaries in australia and even we have debited friends from from the great cricketing nation of New Zealand you're going to give Richie McCaw a bowl and and but particularly for students I think it's a fantastic insight to see how that cooperation between the medical side the researchers and the families and the patients leads to great initiatives and advancements because it's from from us listening to patients we find out what are the important things that we should be looking at should be researching we should be trying to understand so welcome to everyone and really looking forward to today's program but hope everyone has a great couple of days so thanks you
wZPQ3ma1Z1M,Dr Ethan Russo MD 2 of 2 &amp; close by Lucy Haslam,2016-06-09T10:07:16Z,"a dr. Ethan Russo is a bore a neurologist pharmacal pharmacology researcher and medical director of fight X which is a bio technical company researching and developing innovative approaches targeting the human endocannabinoid system he serves on the scientific advisory board for the American botanical council is the author of numerous books book chapters and articles on cannabis ethnobotany and herbal medicine it gives me great pleasure to welcome him back ladies and gentlemen put your hands together for dr. Ethan yourself okay well welcome again I appreciate the stalwarts that have stayed through to the end once again my contact email is up here Ethan Russo at comcast.net so we are going to be talking more about cannabis today in some practical issues there'll be a little disruptive technology here I can't promise it'll be as entertaining as dr. Caldecott I don't know if he's still out there but odd thing happened in my genealogy and apparently I'm two percent Irish how that happened we can't figure out but I'm pleased to say it first we're going to deal with the species issue on cannabis and occasionally during this talk I may say things that contradict some of what my colleagues have said but I'm just presenting one biased but hopefully educated opinion on this they've been various ways that cannabis has been described on one classification that's withstood the test of time is that from earnest small this is about 30 or 40 years old talking about different types of cannabis type one would be high THC cannabis which is going to be the most commonly encountered in Australia and in fact most of the world due to the homogenous Asian of the gene Poul um historically however more commonly in places where cannabis was used as a drug would be type 2 places like the old-time Moroccan strains or Afghan strains would be a mixed population THC and CBD about equal on type 3 would be more like European hemp we're cannabidiol was predominant um but these are worthwhile ways to describe things um the cannabis controversy with respect to species start several hundred years ago the the name cannabis sativa was first used by Leonhardt Fuchs about two hundred and fifty years before Linnaeus formalized the Latin binomial way of naming species so he's on the left there and this is the actual botanical voucher on next to him of cannabis sativa which means cultivated cannabis about twenty years later Antoine Lamarck on the right described what he thought was a different species cannabis indica from India and just as they didn't agree there's been no uniformity of opinion on the species issues since and this isn't confined to cannabis botanical taxonomist just fight about names on they're constantly changing and it's a problem I'm just going to back up for a second note something important although these do look a little different the cannabis indica that Lamarck described from India was a narrow leaflet much like of the European hemp that Linnaeus described in contrast on one of my mentors professor scholtes at Harvard pictured here with his trusty guide in Afghanistan don't try this now wouldn't be advisable but he's next to a very short squat broad leaflet plant that he called indica what's quite different to what Lamarque described his scheme was for cannabis sativa like the tall hemp you see on the left the bushy cannabis indica in the middle and another cannabis ruderalis an unbranched 1 meter plant with very low cannabinoid content so that was his scheme but we see that things are really hard to pin down our friend David Watson is pictured here with a plant that has these broad leaflets on clearly an indica arm by that criterion um if you agree with professor scholtes but this is actually a Chinese hemp plant with huge seeds on its very tall like the European hemp would be then we have a picture from the reef Mountains in Morocco and there even though genetically it's like a lot of the other cannabis it's a 1 meter on branch plant because they don't water don't irrigate don't fertilize and that's just all I can manage this has been really in the last decade and not a series of articles were written by Carl Hill aghh he was actually trying to classify cannabis on the basis of its biochemistry which in a lot of ways makes a lot more sense particularly when we're trying to deal with the pharmacology and medical uses what this article showed was that all the varieties that were tested had some amount of THC and or CBD but terpenoids provided the best demarcation between the chemo bars those are chemical varieties or what some people call strains on you've seen the scheme yesterday from Rob Rob Clark and Mark Merlyn in their book and this is a nice classification in that it combines a description of the plant how it appears like narrow leaf drug or narrow leaf hemp broad leaf drug um and dots so it has some practicality but none of this is totally satisfactory um they have a good classification scheme you'd need to describe the shape of the plant its chemical content and perhaps its purpose with respected use by man it'd be good to include some measure of the basic class based on the cannabinoid profile like type 1 for high THC we also want to describe the morphology the shape of the plant broad leaflet compact versus tall and spindly uh it'd be good to have a measure the specific cannabinoid content as consumers this is useful information and certainly necessary from the standpoint of using cannabis as a medicine additionally many of us believe that the turpenoid content or what really makes one chemo verb cannabis distinct from another so that should be included and it might be nice to have a description of the scent the taste if it's vaporized for example and how it might be useful and that should be patient oriented the best scheme i've seen is this from napery search on and this is a published information now they've the scheme that you see on the right it's called the phyto facts and so it describes the amount of cannabinoids you get a picture of the bud unfertilized female flower and top then there is a scent and taste profile on often there'll be pictures of a recognizable plant the lemon there means that there's limonene in it on the black peppercorns mean that there is carry awfully then in the middle on the right you have the effects as described by consumers of this particular keema var and you see that this one's high in comfort and energy and it's low in relaxation meaning it's not sedating then most important dog my opinion is the terpenoid profile if you look at the bars it's very high in yellow that's limonene to me that indicates that this would be a chemo VAR of cannabis that would be very good at elevating mood and also would have some immune potentiating effects the blue bar which is very high as well indicates that it's high in cari awfully cari awfully niz an agonist at the cb2 receptor it is an analgesic painkiller an anti-inflammatory agent so overall we've got THC which is going to be good for a lot of things we've got the mood elevation and the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects finally at the bottom in purple that's very low Mercy Mercy is the couch lock factor the sedating and narcotic influence in many cannabis chemo VARs particularly prevalent in most drug team of ours today it's very low so this would be an agent that could be used without daytime sedation let's say a couple of words about landraces these are chemical varieties of cannabis that have long been grown outdoors in a particular environment and so they've adapted to local conditions on you know the particular climate and particularly the Predators what bugs are there what chemical defenses can be mounted that make it adapt to that location unfortunately around the world in places like Jamaica Colombia Morocco Afghanistan and Thailand these have been replaced by the seeds that everyone's using from California and from Amsterdam so in a sense many wonderful advantageous traits have been lost people that look like me with gray hair that may have experienced cannabis decades ago often wax nostalgic about how it was then because there were real qualitative differences in the chemical content so this just isn't a bunch of old fogies um who don't have anything going these days there are efforts now underway to try and preserve some of this genetic legacy now we're going to shift gears we're going to be a little bit hither and yon hopefully hit a few controversies um this is THC a long journey a banal or Marinol it looks a lot like fish eggs that's and because it's so expensive that's why I call it the caviar of prescription medicines in the States this was approved as a pharmaceutical in 1985 to treat nausea associated with chemotherapy and then in 1992 for AIDS wasting it's a slow start it could be 1 to 3 hours it makes it very hard to titrate the dose THC alone unlike most cannabis is not doesn't produce euphoria tends to produce dysphoria and unhappiness it is just used orally and so it will be converted in the liver 211 hydroxy THC there's debate about whether that's more psychoactive than THC it's at least as psychoactive and clearly lacks synergistic components the main problem with this is people tolerate it very poorly it has a very low therapeutic index meaning the difference between the dose that might help symptoms and the dose that produces side-effects is too narrow the most common application of cannabis is still smoking but almost everywhere around the world this is still illegal and it actually is the most likely way to produce intoxication because the very rapid absorption you will hear that it's an advantage because it's easy to titrate but that's not true of modern team of ours which are so potent that one Hill inhalation may be more than a given patient needs for their condition it also is actually not very efficient in terms of the bioavailability a lot of the THC or other cannabinoids that are there lost in sidestream smoke it's not all absorbed and then there the obvious problems poly aromatic hydrocarbons that the body has to detoxify I would reiterate that cannabis smoking without tobacco has no correlation to the production of lung cancer however the body does have to process this stuff and it obviously produces bronchial irritation with coughs PUE them and an increase in upper respiratory infections this is not the profile of a drug that the FDA in the States or any regulatory body is likely to approve additionally there are other pitfalls currently there are many pesticides being used in cannabis cultivation and I'm afraid the news isn't good they're high prevalence rates of this study um actually they took a variety of pesticides that have been encountered in cannabis and they put it on to the cannabis to see how much a smoking machine would yield and in fact as much as 70 percent of the pesticides that were on the material ended up in the smoke and could end up in a patient's lungs so this is very sobering data um and I would just say if you didn't know already I'm an organic farmer myself and I think that this is extremely important that consumers be aware and at least have the choice of whether to use such material or not a couple of years ago I surveyed some labs in California that did pesticide testing and just speaking to three Labs ended up with this list I realize this is hard to read but if you just look at the asterisks those are the agents out of the list that are have neurotoxicity or our organophosphates or Aquino phosphates are a particular interest because they when ingested and excess will produce seizures even in a person who had no tendency towards them so you can imagine the danger potentially to a youngster that might be getting a concentrated this material when they have epilepsy already additionally it would just add that I've just submitted an article that includes data from Washington State where there is a legal market but no mandate to do pesticide testing we looked at 26 concentrates and flowers of cannabis from the legal market and 86% were positive for pesticides including many bad actors like these or potential carcinogens and it wasn't a small amount sometimes 10,000 parts per billion so high that the Machine couldn't accurately test them any longer additionally their arm could be dangerous from heavy metals cannabis is what's known as a bio accumulator if there are heavy metals in the soil they'll be recruited into the plant now this is great if you're growing hemp to recover a mining site and dispose of the hemp afterwards but it's obviously a problem if it gets into cannabis use medicinally so this is a potential problem also and there very few labs that are testing for heavy metals additionally um people grow cannabis don't always wash their hands or they may be using fertilizer that is contaminated by fecal material so there's always the possibility of microbes bacteria however it is entirely possible the grow cannabis cleanly in soil without this problem it can be done but some nations particularly odds tons some places in Canada it has been done and in Holland they choose to gamma or radiate the product to me it's like saying well you don't have to bathe well just cover it up with more clothes why not have clean culture to begin with now there will people that there are people that will swear up and down the gamma radiation is safe for your cannabis however there's never been any safety study of gamma radiation on a smoked product and we know that it reduces the terpenoid content there was just a study published that the idea was to mitigate the possible fallout of this practice however one of the varieties they tested reduced its carry off alene content 10% if you need that carry off lean for your pain relieving properties and as an anti-inflammatory um that could be significant and I've reiterate on that the biggest problems with contamination and difficult growing conditions are indoors this is a byproduct of the black-market greenhouses are better you can control things there are fewer problems but outdoors would be even better for most purposes now let's talk a little bit about vaporization on the upper right you see a popular device called the volcano because of its shape this puts vapor into a bag that can then be inhaled and you can dial in the temperature and these are the effects at different temperatures first a is unheated then 175 degrees Celsius 195 and then 230 where it's obviously toasted but not quite burnt the problem with this is twofold um it's still inhalation and because of the high peaks that we'll see subsequently on a graph I'll show you of serum activity and brain activity it gets in too fast and can produce intoxication regulatory bodies don't like that additionally because no study of any vaporizer is shown total elimination of the poly aromatic hydrocarbons and other tar components um this is going to be a difficult thing to get past regulators additionally um it's been shown that there is the potential for a good bit of ammonia in inhaled material even when it's vaporized and ammonia is a neurotoxin as well these are just some ways that you see cannabis sold obviously the sense of me of buds something that has been a problem in many areas is cannabis confections that look exactly like candy bars with funny names that sound like the candy bars obviously this is attractive to children and obviously law enforcement hates this kind of thing additionally they've been sprays I call this one I can't believe it's not Sativex but the technology isn't necessarily quite the same this was a study that our know cause a comp and his colleagues did a few years back and actually if we look the majority of people using cannabis medicinally are still smoking a little over 72% and although about 54% had tried vaporizers only 27% preferred them so it really hasn't gained the market share if you will that we might hope for in in terms of harm reduction and in this sample which again was a few years ago now few were using it orally which has advantages in terms of a longer duration of action um particularly in the recreational market we've had two developments one is selective breeding for ever higher amounts of THC also extraction techniques to to magnify the amount of THC Rob's book hashish looked at this some time ago and in the olden days you could get maybe 30% THC from a high quality hashish with modern techniques you can get that up to about 60% but that's not enough for some people now we have cannabis concentrates and these go by different names whack shatter dabs and on the left is another study from Hausa comp at all they're looking at different extraction techniques with naphtha which is a petroleum distillate with ether ethanol and then olive oil and these all help get things out there's some minor differences in what gets out but generally you need what's called a polar solvent to get the cannabinoids and terpenoids out many of these are flammable or explosive every couple of weeks in the Seattle area where I live there's a story in the paper about somebody burning down their house or exploding on their house from trying to use butane hash oil extraction techniques so you really concentrate the THC but often these solvents are not eliminated they can't be purged entirely and particularly if somebody's using commercial lighter fluid they're going to be contaminants there that remain in the material that smoked there was a survey done in 2014 even people who use this material acknowledge that they develop tolerance and he had to use more of this over time to get high and that's some some experience withdrawal symptoms I would just mean teen to you that there are very few instances in which a medical patient requires this kind of material on the premium should be on using the lowest dose of THC the control symptoms without the requirement to produce intoxication or high now I'm not going to tell you today that I think euphoria is a side effect or a bad thing but it's not what most patients are looking for in their medicine rather they want the release for the relief of their symptoms and hopefully be able to go about their day to work or study without these other Reaper again we have these vape pens um this is a bit of a misnomer on back up for a second so you see the components of this on on the bottom here then opening it up you've got this wax called that for the obvious reason that it looks like it there's an unheated coil but as soon as you press the button this thing is red-hot in seconds that's not vaporization that's burning and just even though there's not any longer any plant material there's just the extract this is going to create funny stuff in the smoke and again not necessary for the medical effect that's desired and it gets worse some of the material is so thick that you can't work with it and so it will be dissolved with a propellant usually propylene glycol and glycerol this study that's in the New England Journal of Medicine actually looked at a cigarettes but it's the same propellant it's just got nicotine in it instead unfortunately a lot of the vape pens operate at these very high temperatures like you saw the red-hot coil and when you do that this otherwise benign propellant becomes formaldehyde as much as 2% now that doesn't sound like a lot but the estimated that since this is a carcinogen that it could raise a risk of cancer 15 times of that of smoking cigarettes so right now there might not be an obvious problem but I hate to see what happens in 30 years if this industry isn't cleaned up now next one I'll often hear from certain advocates the cannabis has no side effects I cringe when I hear that of course it does everything does and when somebody says cannabis has no side effects they've lost the argument because immediately people who know better going to tin them out but what are these now the study I am presenting but also criticized because it was sort of lumped everything together you've got a synthetic THC you've got Sativex you've got smoked cannabis it's all put together in general at the top you see nervous system disorders 39 percent reported side effects in that area and 36 percent psychiatric disorders so those are the most likely to occur with cannabis particularly in the naive user the panic the anxiety if severe of the freak out the toxic psychosis other things are less common putting and honing in on what's typically reported you see the list central nervous system affects the things I've mentioned also decrease in muscle tone a good thing recreationally a heightened sensory perception bad things short decrease short-term memory but it could be a good thing if you have post-traumatic stress and outside the nervous system there's some other side effects we should mention the rapid heart rate again more likely in the naive user and if we have a high dose like a vape pan there have been many ER visits because of what's called orthostatic hypotension this means that the heart slows down in this instance so much that the person can't get enough blood to the brain and they pass out now the good part is they get horizontal they wake up but they may crack their skull on the way down and end up in the emergency room and it's a very serious thing um this was a comparison I put together on published some years ago the cool colors are Sativex the aura mucosal a spray a combination of TC and CBD with terpenoids that approved in 27 countries in the olden days doses of up to 128 sprays a day were allowed with a very rapid titration and increase in dose so those are the blue colors the warm colors in this our government approved programs of cannabis in the Netherlands and in Canada these are comparable studies because there are long term use and the side effects reported and I realize you can't read all these but it's all the the usual suspects all of these are much higher in the warm colors than the cool colors except for dizziness where it's higher with Sativex than for smoke cannabis but um there was a difference in the program those are the old data um if we compare this study on previous ms studies there were 663 patients and then there was a pivotal study that led to approval 573 patients so almost as many the difference is the old studies in blue were the high doses in rapid titration and the the red were a slow titration with the limit a day of 12th phrase which would be about almost 20 milligrams of THC is a limited day and you see dizziness now has been cut from 32 percent down to about 13 percent and you have cut all the other side effects fatigue somnolence nausea dry mouth in half so again a demonstration that sometimes less is more this is particularly true for cannabis where the dose is the lowest dose of THC that will produce benefit on the symptoms and again hopefully without producing side effects so yes medicinal cannabis has side effects they're just not as bad as the ones you see described on American TV for drug ads now how many have seen pharmaceutical ads on TV in the States well it's good it's not more because they're disgusting they will have some poor person with inflammatory bowel disease that looks miserable until they take the new drug that you're supposed to ask your doctor to get and then their life is beautiful they're walking through the forest and it's all sweetness and light while an announcer in the background that you're supposed to ignore recites a litany of life-threatening symptoms from this drug so to be honest there are side effects they really are not anything like we get from most modern pharmaceuticals when properly used I'm just going to summarize this slide and I've alluded to this a little bit um there's a relationship between how fast a delivery technique is for THC or cannabis and the number of side effects and obviously something fast like inhalation produces higher levels in the blood and brain and will produce more side-effects also the faster it is the better people like it if that's why they're using the drug so obviously for recreational use you get more people inhaling than you do using a spray in the mouth or an edible although that's good for a longer duration like a concert so this is you saw a variant of this yesterday and this is the pharmacokinetics how things get into the blood now what you've gotten blue is smoked cannabis and you see within a couple of minutes it's spiking anything over 80 is going to be highly desired by the recreational user so we're hitting one sixty here oh that's a win for the recreational you user for vaporization it's really comparable and then in green you see what happened with Sativex now this these doses are tried to an attempt was made to make them equivalent but there's a big difference you see this low slow hill on no peak sharp peak what's happening is that this is being absorbed through the mucous membranes in the mouth and some is swallowed in the gut but it leaks out into the the bloodstream slowly and it's going to go preferentially into the brain your brains all fat THC likes fat and that's where it goes among other places but the difference is there are no spikes of activity and so even though ultimately the amount of drug that's getting into the body is the same the effects in terms of the intoxication are much much lower that risk is lower so how fast something gets in if it's faster it produces more reinforcements the tendency to use more and more event more quickly another aspect of what's called drug abuse liability on whether a drug is abusable or not as the development development of Tolerance in the graph on the top you see the number of sprays per day that patients with MS used over the course of seventy five weeks so a year and a half now this is interesting if you had a graph for opiates for pain typically the doses are going to go up not only does the dose not go up it actually goes down over time and the reason is the patient's found that with continued use that they got by with a little bit less so they went from like nine sprays a day on down to about eight that is statistically significant similarly in terms of intoxication on the bottom graph on left we're looking at a visual analog scale of intoxication again anything over 20 is going to produce some effect that the patient identifies below that means they don't really feel it admittedly these patients are on a mixture of drugs are ready they they were on antidepressants anticonvulsants all these drugs to to control their symptoms but without control and so sativex was added in this instance sativex wasn't any different than placebo in terms of intoxication obviously there going to be some patients where it was different but the aggregate is not another big controversy is danger of smoking or using cannabis medicinally and its effects on driving well this is actually tested with Sativex patients before with it multiple sclerosis before they went on the medicine and then several weeks later to boil down a bunch of data on all of these except the one with the asterisk are not significantly different before and after that's a good thing what it means was that being on the drug in doses to control symptoms didn't produce any impairment in these domains now the one that was different was actually better on treatment and that's called determination the patients were trying hard and apparently succeeding in their driving efforts from the same study which was a couple of years ago and looked at many hundreds of patients post-marketing with this particular agent Sativex another issue was taken up and that is does cannabis produce cognitive impairment give you problems with your thinking so it's bad enough to have a chronic disease if you're going to superimpose problems from the drug on top of it it's not how full but in this instance again no significant difference in cognitive ability before going on the drug and after the drug however we then compare that to what's on the right and you see these this is the patient global impression of change physician and caregiver global impression of change meaning house daily life going what can you manage that you couldn't before and in each instance a significant improvement in the patient's status as judged by themselves their spouse and their doctor there was a drug abuse liability study done on the Pixum all Sativex and at low doses people who customarily use cannabis can tell it from placebo so these are people that have a little bit of tolerance at least to THC effects at min high doses 8 and 16 sprays at once which is not a dose that a patient would normally take it's well above that because most patients use 6 to 8 sprays a day for most conditions but again trying to produce a challenge to see what happens in this instance there was a difference from placebo but only small differences between Marinol pure THC and Sativex but when there were the differences they were in favor of Sativex producing less drug liking and other things that would go along with whether it's going to be an abusable drug or not so just to give you context on it in the States cannabis is in schedule 1 forbidden it's illegal ok pure THC is journey abinell was originally in schedule 2 like cocaine and amphetamines but it was put in schedule 3 because they figured out that nobody wanted it there was no black market for it so if Sativex is less liked than marinol in terms of being a drug effect that a typical user of cannabis would want then it properly deserves a lower schedule additionally in the program which has now been going on for 16 years I'm only aware of one instance of attempted abuse or diversion and this is a picture of it something trying to get into that vial to get at the medicine but it turns out that the perpetrator was a little dog so there's been monitoring of sites on to find out what's going on in the the drug user arena you know find out what the hot new trends are and seemingly there's no black market for Sativex so for people that were worried about whether this is going to be on the streets or wanted to get it apparently it's just not that much fun it's a lot easier to score joint spliff whatever on the street corner I guess another controversy again has to do with is cannabis a true herbal medicine or their other components or is it just a vehicle for THC or cannabidiol you know what the combination of called the entourage effect so this is two entourage or not two entourage on the left you've got pure crystals of cannabidiol versus a plant that produces it um well this is a demonstration I think I showed this yesterday but just to reiterate if we look at the 30 percent improvement in ping level this is with cancer patients in hospice this is considered very highly significant in this study in the gray is placebo in blue is tetran Ebonics a high THC extract um as compared to the green which is sativex with high THC extract and a high CBD extract so the only difference is the presence of cannabidiol and all of a sudden there's a statistically significant difference between it compared to placebo and the high THC extract so a clear demonstration of verbal synergy again a demonstration of the difference between a whole plant extract of sativex compared to THC this is a study that was looking at whether high doses of Sativex would produce cardiac conduction abnormalities what's called the QTc interval and i was aghast at the study design which required for people to take as many as 18 sprays of Sativex at once um but although one of these reactions the toxic psychosis somebody freaking out happened i was able to witness in toronto canada with the first exposure there were only four out of 250 exposures so really not that bad and again let me emphasize a dose much higher than ever recommended so I put together this graph we know that toxic psychosis has happened with THC is Marinol with as little as 10 or 15 milligrams you see the bar graph they are on the safe threshold is below 15 milligrams above that you have the risk of this side effect with sativex that risk goes up to 48 milligrams THC so that's a very considerable difference with a good safety margin a better therapeutic index for a whole cannabis extract now again shifting gears I understand in this country that people have cannabis medicine have no way to test their material this is a real problem again as consumers we'd like to have all the knowledge that we can about what we're taking and what we might need there's been a similar problem in the u.s. although there are labs although it's technically illegal there is the availability of testing however there's not a uniform methodology applied there's also a lot of what's called dry labbing dry labbing means you look at the plant and say well it has a lot of trichomes and it smells good therefore we're going to call this one 18% THC and you may scoff but this is exactly what goes on in some places part of the problem also is any accuracy lab to lay out the problem is there aren't good cannabinoid standards the standard is a set amount of a test compound that you can use to analyze and compare so that's another problem I'm doing cannabinoid assays is difficult it's sticky material you've got to have it mixed properly it depends totally on how you sample it but terpenoids the amounts are much much smaller and these are even harder to test another shift um you know we we keep hearing that we need more clinical trials and this is true but the clinical trials that have been done with herbal cannabis so far have been really problematic and part of this is just political what's been allowed in a given area particularly in the states all the studies of herbal cannabis have been very short in duration and tend to be very small in size the material that supplied is not standardized um it's only characterized as the cannabinoid content with no terpenoid analysis additionally let's say you did a study in Parkinson's disease and you've got a great result and you wanted to reproduce and development it develop it as a drug you could not because you could not get the same material again and it wouldn't be sufficiently consistent chemically to develop as a drug so it is a system that's been designed to fail additionally the studies that have been done have been poorly blinded in other words people who got the cannabis could tell it was cannabis and not placebo so the kinds of clinical trials that have been done to date have done nothing to advance herbal cannabis as a an agent that could be approved by the regulators now we're going to use my friend Donald Abrams study here as an example he was looking at on NIDA that's National Institute on Drug Abuse supplied cannabis and 50 subjects for three days in a condition called HIV associated neuropathy this is very hard to treat with conventional drugs the Ethics Committee required that everyone have smoking experience before so this you can't generalize this to a general population who might have never used cannabis if you're going to have a successful medicine it has to work and people who've never used it - but that wasn't tested here now it did produce benefit on pain definitely but this is such a short duration normally for this indication you need a 12-week study not a five-day study the biggest problem was the side effect profile and if you see on the right 25% had anxiety 54% sedation 16% disorientation and 13% paranoia I guarantee you that the FDA would not approve any drug let alone cannabis that had this kind of profile but this was TAC based cannabis no cannabidiol very low turpenoid content not on what could be done potentially in comparison sativex earn the big symbols as I've mentioned is from standardized strains or chemo VARs one high in THC one high in cannabidiol it has terpenoids it is put in a vehicle with propylene glycol and ethanol but it's not smoked and it is safe to spray that way each spray gives 2.7 milligrams of THC and 2.5 of cannabidiol and it's got a masking agent a peppermint oil so its effect as intermediate if you took enough to feel we come on in about 15 to 40 minutes so it's not like smoking it does allow good dose titration and it's been acceptable to patients although they may hate the taste and again this is a variation of what I showed yesterday if we look at just the studies in pain with sativex it's 6000 patient years compared to three patient years with smoked cannabis so there's a much better body of evidence from which to draw inference now having said all that surveys are very illustrative of certain points this was mentioned yesterday this study looked at states with cannabis uh medical cannabis laws and the mortality due to opioid overdoses whether to heroin or prescribed opiates what we see was there was a big increase over the decade on that's not news but you see in the top left that it plateaued and decreased that's what happened in the states that had cannabis available and so there was this clear statistical evidence three chances in a in a thousand that this is due to chance there was a twenty four point eight percent lower overdose mortality in states that had medical cannabis available and it was estimated in 2010 that one thousand seven hundred and twenty nine lives were saved because of this I will indicate to you that the same issue of this journal the journal American Medical Association internal medicine had an editorial where they bent over backwards to try and explain this away but none of it made any sense this is a real finding as we've heard yesterday cannabis may well be an exit drug rather than a gateway drug where opioids are concerned no a huge issue in clinical trials um and this is a problem overall not just with cannabis the mere fact of being in a clinical trial generates a certain amount of subjective improvement meaning everybody gets better in the aggregate to a certain degree but that's going to be worse when the randomized control trial lacks objective measures like in studies with pain or of mood you know we don't have a P nomina and we don't have a depression ometer we've got to rely on what the patient says you're never going to have a drug that's successful unless the patient thinks that it helps them so it's not bad to have subjective measures it just makes it more difficult on the placebo effect it's going to be greater if the drug is psychoactive so antidepressants and cannabis also it's worse if the drug has a reputation of being miraculous and believe me there are plenty of people that think that cannabis is I'm here to tell you it's not a miracle it just is a really good drug for a lot of conditions for a lot of people that's the truth um there's a very sobering study that came out a few months ago they looked at placebo responses in the States for neuropathic pain and this is over the course of 23 years and the placebo responses increased a great deal a huge amount in fact so at the beginning um where early studies might show a benefit on pain reduction by about 35% that was down to sixteen and a half percent at the end of the time and the differences between placebo and of the drug in question also narrowed so there for example in the Sativex program there was a study of diabetic neuropathy where sativex work great nope no doubt about it it was working but placebo worked so well there wasn't a significant difference in the study was a failure start over um so this is a huge problem additionally they found out in this study that placebo responses increase the bigger the sample size was statistically you're better if you have a bigger sample because it's more compelling also the longer studies that are necessitous Airi that are mandated by regulatory bodies also make this change in placebo response worse on this issue is looked at specifically with sativex there were no statistical differences in euphoria as one measure for those people who'd use cannabis before and those that were naive and never had experience of it either medicinally or recreationally also in terms of who got better improved there was no difference between the experienced people and the cannabis naive people so that was some evidence I showed this graph yesterday this was a randomized withdrawal trial just to reiterate this is in a spasticity and multiple sclerosis unbeknownst to them initially all the patients got Sativex at the end of a month only the patients who had a 20% decrease in the symptoms in other words responders were continued they came in for a resupply visit in which half of them got sativex the same number of sprays per day and half got placebo instead and then the two groups diverged though that there was a very high statistical significance to the difference at the end so this is called a randomized withdrawal on design and it'd be very helpful to try and minimize some of the problems we've just described however it's not infallible because the same thing was done in a cancer pain study in phase 3 where it was unsuccessful um so it's not going to be the total solution either so what can be done in clinical trials particularly with Canal to limit these problems first in any clinical trial you have to be very neutral with the patient and say things like this drug may or may not help you if you say I've got this great new stuff we're going to have you try it's definitely going to affect the patient's expectations you should avoid ancillary benefits that means in your study you shouldn't offer free massages at the same time as your intervention because everybody's going to look forward to their next visit it also is very helpful to have a slower delivery technique so inhalation is problematic as compared to oral for example additionally it's very helpful to have agents whole cannabis for example that have terpenoid and cannabidiol buffers that will attenuate the effects of THC on intoxication so where are we now in terms of proof of cannabis we've got solid evidence for this less nausea and vomiting on anorexia associated with chemotherapy and hiv/aids spasticity and MS and other conditions there's been a study of cerebral palsy and children with sound effects on neuropathic pain where their central or peripheral cancer pain and lower urinary tract symptoms for cannabidiol we have clinical trials with success in intractable epilepsy specifically drove ace also schizophrenia both on positive and negative symptoms clinical research priorities and so you know for when you're talking to people in charge here what's needed in Australia in the rest of the world more studies on pain and inflammation remember pain on surveys is 70 percent of patients using cannabis particularly in conditions that haven't been studied yet all the types of arthritis rheumatoid nastya Oh inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's and ulcerative colitis metabolic syndrome most of the Australians I see a pretty trim in the states I can tell you that we're killing ourselves with food on over fifty percent of the population is obese at this time and headed towards type-2 diabetes so this is a huge problem as you've heard cannabis is great for the skin various conditions potentially a very good neuro protective agent may be a preventative in the future for dementia a traumatic brain injury and strokes and then there things can be done to optimize them to cannabinoid health like the dietary manipulations which we mentioned yesterday other lifestyle approaches that might reduce the need for cannabis or at least the dose that's needed to control symptoms what we need now is more standardized good manufacturer manufacturing practice cannabis where we know what's in a appropriate cannabinoid interpreted profiles and we need some genuine advanced stage clinical trials that meet regulatory standards and aren't just going to be relegated to anecdotal labels we don't need a lot more case studies these are interesting it's all people can manage sometimes within the constraints in their country or budgets we don't need a lot more surveys the surveys are very compelling as it is we also don't need more studies in the states with NIDA cannabis that can't be developed or characterized we don't need to waste public funds to conclude cannabis as proven medical potential and has led to the discovery of the endocannabinoid system a major physiologic homeostatic regulatory mist mechanism cannabis in a proper formulation can become an approved pharmaceutical in the US or around the world that fulfills necessary criteria of safety efficacy and consistency and just a few final thoughts and some of this is redundant I'll skip the ones that are I hope that I've emphasized to you that one cannabis preparation is not like another so if one is approved as a pharmaceutical it doesn't mean it's going to change the scheduling or status of another each is going to have to prove its efficacy and safety in the marketplace again the clinical trials to date have mainly been too short too small and employed unstandardized material with unreproducible results we've got a problem in our clinical trials with blinding and excessive placebo responses on hopefully as a parting message you keep smiling because there are other ways to the goal of optimized in a cannabinoid system health and I'll thank you again for your attention thank you very much dr. Russo well that's our final educational speaker I'm going to invite Lucy up to say a few words just in closing so ladies and gents Lucy Haslem thanks everybody and thanks for staying till the end I think you'll agree that it was worth worth being the diehards I think thanks for ringing the bell for me though but I haven't finished first of all I'd like to thank Tim for being our host for the weekend you've done a fantastic job and I hope you're available for the next one hopefully in Melbourne it's bit hard to sum this up briefly but you know for me there's been some very high points and there's been just a couple of low points so just in summary I want to thank our speakers in particular our international speakers you know Ethan Russo has come here for two days he was in Paraguay a few days ago you know here he is and he's going back to the States for his wife's birthday you know so thanks to mrs. Russo for letting him come happy wife happy life thank you everybody else for coming from Spain and Israel and the States and thank you to all our Australian speakers and it just really makes the reinforces for me that you know we have great we have great talent in Australia there's great interest in Australia and we can do this ourselves with the help of our colleagues who have now agreed to collaborate and you know that's invaluable so thank you for that so for me another highlight has been the confirmation from the premiere yesterday that they're going to review the terminal illness cannabis scheme and get rid of that name so that hopefully will begin tomorrow with a meeting that will be taking part in so that's been a you know highlight for me it really needs to go from being a terminal illness scheme to being a compassionate user scheme and that can't happen quick enough just I just want to touch on low points because I think it's worth mentioning for United in compassion we feel that the way to move forward is to do it slowly to do it well but to do it respectfully and you know over the course of the last couple of days people have thanked me for keeping the price of this slow and affordable so so many more people can come and that you know that was a name but that couldn't have happened without premier Baird who was he yesterday being heckled from the crowd and for me that was a low point because whilst I appreciate that things happen slowly and it's frustrating particularly as a parent and I've been in that I've been in those shoes and I know that journey and it's a pretty hard place to be but I think the fact of the matter is we've come so far in the last 18 to 20 months there have been people that have been advocating for medical cannabis and cannabis generally for the last four or five decades and they've done it in a way that's been disrespectful and has actually kept us in a holding pattern well this is purely my view but it's kept us in a holding pattern far longer than we need it to be so I feel we need to be thankful for the the small gains that we make and in being thankful and in being respectful I think that that is probably the best way to move forward and so that's the way that United in compassion will continue to move forward we will have our critics and I appreciate that but I just wanted to pass on that famille was sad yesterday that the main focus of having these wonderful speakers here was you know that I saw afflicted on media on the television last night was the heckling that was happening to the premier on his way out and rather than talking about the fantastic presentations that we were being given you know from people like bonnie goldstein and ethan and geoffrey hergenrother we were focusing on the negative you know heckling and you know for me that was an absolute low point so I just wanted to share that I don't want to end on a positive note it's been fantastic and I'm so pleased that everybody made the effort to come and please you know go forward and spread the word I just probably on one one final thing and that was a little bit of the law was the fact that we only had a couple of doctors here and that you know for me you know we did target doctors we did try and get doctors here so to have only a few in the audience is you know is a little disappointing but just to finish on a high we've got David Caldecott on our side and oh my god isn't he dangerous and absolutely better than having with us and against us so with that I'll leave you and thank you very much okay folks that does bring to a close the 2016 you're not in compassion medicinal cannabis symposium I just wanted to introduce you to my little girl Arielle and just say that yeah I mean as you as you leave here you're going to hear this notion obviously pushed by us and many other people and hopefully it's not doesn't end up being used as a political football but the notion of compassionate access and what it really is about is about people like her and the thousands of kids out there that can be helped by cannabis and that it makes a real difference in their lives and I just want to leave that with you and thank you all so much for being a part of this thank you to all our contributors and everybody this come from overseas it's been absolutely wonderful and thank you to Lucy and Lou and Troy for allowing me to be a part of it because it's been a great privilege and I thank you all very very much bless you all you"
Cq9p4CLQ50I,Cannabis Symposium Pt 1,2016-03-10T21:29:58Z,
ektpzZtQxHc,Dr. Andrew Katelaris - FULL INTERVIEW,2016-01-18T00:15:15Z,hello and welcome to another episode of the music weed and cheese podcast in the area of childhood epilepsy nothing is as good as CBD medicine our guest today is dr. Andrew catalyst we can salvage more than 50% of the kids that are given up for dead by the allopathic system andrew is a trained physician and holds a doctorate in medical research his mission is to get cannabis medicine to those who need it most my personal view for medical cannabis going forward in this country is the right for people to grow their own cannabis this is a non-negotiable position and not some squiggly little thing despite costing him his registration as a medical doctor Andrew holds firm to his views made passionate by the fact that medical needs are not being met by the registered medical community ask bad how many kids receive cannabis under his proposals this is music we cheese my name's dr. Andrew cattle IRAs I graduated from Sydney Uni in 1982 and practiced a hospital-based medicine both clinical and pathological based and research based medicine until 2005 when I was d registered as a result of my involvement in the medical cannabis business in 1990 I was awarded a doctorate in medicine for medical research and therefore I still earn and hold the title dr. Andrew cattle heiress despite the what the Medical Board would like it to be that's great that you have the expertise and have been trained not only as a medical doctor but as a researcher you're doing research with cannabis and a lot of people make big claims about cannabis and yourself included but you don't see it as a panacea but as an important part of an overall treatment and you also stress things like lifestyle and diet you speak about that a little bit well I have been increasingly disturbed to a great degree by advice that are coming from many sometimes senior doctors with the patient's aware interacting with in the hospital system when we encourage say for instance we're doing a pediatric patient we encourage the path their parents to provide only wholesome and nutritious food and we're constantly countermanded by seeing your doctor saying it matters little what the child eats this is science gone mad it's even not adhering to their own basic tenants of what scientific medicine should be you just have to look at Hospital based food to know they're not really serious about nutrition and I mean the role of nutrition in the treatment of many diseases goes back for thousands of years it's not a fad or something that comes and goes I mean Hippocrates and the Chinese before constantly stressed the importance of diet and now we have these see a scientist in white coats telling parents it doesn't matter what the children eat right and that in the face of an epidemic of undiagnosed diseases like autism and other such brain dysfunctions that they have no credible explanation for and no credible therapy for right by simply ignoring that there is a dietary link between most of our diseases well in acknowledging the role of diet and nutrition it's also important to a knowledge that there is a medical role for cannabis in many diseases not the least of which is one close to many people's hearts because of the way it affects the lives of everyone in one way or another and that is cancer could you speak to your experiences with cannabis and cancer there's major issues where we're talking about the use of cannabis in the treatment of cancer starting right at the beginning which is where we like to start there is now abundant abundant evidence linking cannabis with a reduction in the cancer in a preventative role so pre cancer exposure to cannabis results in less cancer this might be a distasteful fact for people working within the current system or people working within the prohibitionists framework but it remains that it was it was produced by Donald kashkin in the United States who was looking for a connection between cancer of Hierro digestive system and cannabis smoking instead came up with the idea that cannabis smokers had 30% less cancer generally the non-smokers right so preventative role is very important the next thing is we're still gaining experience with the use of cannabis in the actual treatment of cancer what and we've only got two years experience and at that stage we had very little CBD cannabis it's clear that a combination works better than either alone so experience in our results hopefully will improve as we get quality control and quantity control of the cannabis supply but one a number of things have emerged over the last two years and that's whilst cannabis can occasionally affect a dramatic reversal in cancer and we have seen clearance of metastatic lesions it's still not immune to the cancer becoming resistant to cannabis therapy and actually recurring even in the presence of cannabis therapy so it's not a panacea by any means but one effect that we have seen in people who've suffered recurrent metastasis it slows down the rate of metastatic spread so almost always if people interact in a positive way with us and receive and implement dietary changes and cannabis therapy they're just tailored to their particular condition we can improve their condition although dramatic cures are only occasionally seen actually I left out a really important part it's now becoming increasingly established that the use of narcotic analgesics actually accelerates the final cancer phase so we consider it important that and further the paracetamol is now clearly understood as a cumulative liver toxin and an oxidative stress on the human body it's hardly as safe and gentle as we once believed and what we find important is to find a non stressful way of providing analgesia that won't encourage the cancer and that'll keep the person in the best possible health so it has a number of different effects by providing optimal pain control minimizing narcotic and non-steroidal intake you can improve the patient's general health so it's valuable even though it may not actually cure the cancer in a dramatic fashion you are not the only person supplying cannabis to sick people others around the country are doing it too and seeing the types of results you speak of for instance Matthew and Elizabeth palate down in Melbourne they have been raided and arrested and are being dragged through the court system though following their case it seems sometimes more like they are dragging the government through the court system are you aware of the pellets in their case and are you involved with any similar cases I've visited met an Elizabeth several times over the years I like this spirit Matt's a man who holds these convictions firmly but only carefully chosen conviction so we certainly support them in their case we are hoping to run our own test case in the near future one of the mothers of one of the epileptic children that I'm treating has been arrested and charged with provision a very dangerous drug to a minor and this even though she was offered a get out of jail card by the DPP when they realized what that actually done they offered to reduce it down to a simple supply and keep it in the magistrate's court this brave intelligent woman has elected to go to the Supreme Court where we'll be conducting a medical necessity defense and we expect to convince any jury with even eight any quarter of their morality intact to see the wisdom intelligence of a thing and agreed that this is a medical necessity in the area of childhood epilepsy nothing is as good as CBD medicine but we can salvage more than 50% of the kids that are given up for dead by the allopathic system 50% of them we can salvage to almost not normality because they're often damaged children but we can certainly dramatically improve their lot in life we can drastically reduce their need for hospitalization and in excellent cases we can actually reduce the dangerous drugs they're on to a minimum or eliminate altogether so that's where we have more experience and a great deal of confidence so we are very confident to take this to the court system and bear in mind what is our court system it's a bunch of overpaid retired lawyers they're on three to five hundred thousand dollars a year to wring their hands and follow laws that they know a remor all right the Nuremberg trials after the Second World War established a critically important thing and that is each person is responsible for their behavior when judged by human conscience and morality it's no good to say you were following the law these judges and magistrates have incarcerated thousands of people for using cannabis medically and at some stage they'll need to be accountable because they're acting in an immoral way and the fact that they're following the law is no defense certainly in a higher metaphysical sense there's no defense whatsoever hmm how important are these cases in pressing the medical cannabis issue forward what we'd like to think if we get one medical necessity acquittal that really does open the floodgates and what we hope it'll teach our police and I'm not one that bashes the police but having made observations of their behavior over the last thirty years I can say a few things for that contradiction I mean whilst they're not the sharpest knives on the rack there is a certain sort of concrete and mentality to their thinking and almost a total lack of nuancing when it comes to behaviors luckily a few cracks in that elephants are starting to appear and there's now the suggestion the police can't a blind eye to the medical use of cannabis but it's a long way from filtered through to the rank-and-file but that's what we're wanting I don't feel Australia has the moral structure within its political institutions to actually produce a legal framework where compassionate access is guaranteed and we're proposing a secondary system where we simply operate as a parallel health system and a real health system rather than an elf system but a health system being more or less immune to Public Prosecution by the fact that we have a medical innocence a medical necessity precedent that's the current strategy if you had such a precedent or in some way or other it became legal here in Australia how would your operations change the style would change the scale we operate at the moment we're running in covert grow rooms little patches outside we would operate on a much larger scale we'd have access to advanced analytical gear the HPLC machines and other things like that we'd be able to do at the moment we're doing small pilot studies we're doing the clinical trials that these people claim take millions of dollars we're doing it on a shoestring and getting great results right these academics are really just parasites on the public purse but they take four or five years to produce something in every teenage you can do in a weekend it's just not the way money should be spent let's talk more about the details of what's going on in Australia at the moment some people seem to think that cannabis has already been legalized some recognize that all we have are various proposals and a tiny minority are aware of the medical necessity precedent strategy going on but what do you think of the government proposals that have been put forth as compared to your strategy and the palates strategy of gaining a medical cannabis necessity precedent in the courts there's different models for a medical cannabis scheme operating in Australia from the way I understood it Richard Dean entirely proposed a bill to create an independent office for medical cannabis so that was an independent association that would oversee the production quality control and distribution of medical cannabis now the bill was somewhat loquacious and overly complicated but in principle we supported it unfortunately Malcolm Turnbull has sought fit to take control of that and propose their own bill where the TGA and the federal government have complete control rather than an independent regulator we are very opposed to the TGA having anything to do with this business and we simply won't accept it my personal view for medical cannabis going forward in this country is a three-tier proposal first one and fundamental is the right for people to grow their own cannabis this is a non-negotiable position and not some squiggly little thing up to 20 plants each person as a fundamental right that's the first thing the second thing is we want proxy growing by people our own organizations like the wellness clinic and things like that where we actually grow the cannabis quality control or prepare it and dispense it for patients under our control the third tier if they wish if the doctors that have denigrated cannabis for the last 30 years wish they can use GW Pharmaceuticals which come into the proximately ten times the cost of the cannabis that we manage to produce so there's the three options and that's the way we want it unfortunately Turnbull has tried to maneuver it so that only that third option is present and that's something we oppose very greatly what do you make of AHS can then there are the company involved with the federal government planning to grow medical cannabis crop on Christmas Island in 2016 well they might be growing I mean eventually they'll grow but so what you know that's just a tightly controlled little federal thing it's so what what's it going to change yeah I know them what are they now some retired politician and another banker right running the show so okay good on them they have got you know they'll do some good we're not out to criticize and tear other people down but if they think that's the answer to medical cannabis they're a long way away the answer for medical cannabis in my mind when everyone who needs cannabis has it provided at an affordable cost and aa scam is not going to be able to do that well there are a lot of people who do need it and will need an affordable price we spoke about cancer before a neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and our signers also affect a lot of people can you speak to the role of cannabis in these diseases in Alzheimer's disease it's critically important then to consider the role of the various cannabinoids but THC cannabis is likely to have a minor role in reversing the symptoms of Alzheimer's but CBD dominant cannabis is liked to have a major role if you look as far back as 1985 the united states government attempted to get a patent on the medical uses of CBD claiming it was neuroprotective which it is to a high degree it is neuroprotective it reduces all these chronic inflammatory diseases of the brain but this they tried to get a patent for at a time when the DEA was claiming candidates had no medical usage it's hypocrisy on an industrial scale everything that involves cannabis and the system shows that hypocrisy how is it that we've come to have a system so counterproductive and working against itself with one face of government saying this is a good thing and another saying this is bad it's kind of schizophrenic or bipolar and what what is at the heart of the problem with our health system in your view well we don't have a health system that's the sadness what we have is an ill system dominated by transnational pharmaceutical corporations who are only interested in some ways via their subsidiaries causing disease by disruption of the food supply and the profligate dissemination of dangerous industrial chemicals so causing disease on one hand and then selling snake oil kills on the other you look at the amount of money that's been spent say on blood pressure medicine they call it idiopathic we don't know why you've got it of course we know why people have got blood pressure right and then of course lifestyle is what's needed to bring that down yet we have to compete with the resources of McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken and those sort of mega lamothe megalomaniac food companies that appear determined to destroy health rather than in answer um why don't they like for instance ketamine where you can affect a cure in serious depression in one or two treatments rather than a lifetime on their SSRI drugs which incidentally after 15 years of clinical use have been found to be no better than placebo right and that's another example we are subject to lies and distortion at every step of the way others have covered this a lot better than me during the book Farmageddon I think goes through it in forensic detail the way the medical trials are manipulated we don't even get to see the raw data we only see the data that the corporations of massage but make their stuff look good but if you look back over the last 40 years just been a series of replacements of one false promise with another false promise of the tricyclics depression on now let's see SSRIs all of their BS SN eyes that honored goes as this allusion trails its way into the future the big question is is the population more healthy than it was thirty years ago a resounding no we have increases in most diseases sure a modest decrease in the death from cardiovascular disease but only by the fact of having a lot of chronically reduced people suffering from the disease just not dying of it right so we haven't any track record to be proud of by any means and that's because of the corporate involvement and indeed corporate direction of what we do right all cancer what's the budget for cancer on this planet it is hundreds of billions of dollars yet the insert of cancer is plainly increasing there's no doubt about that even though the doctors turn away they don't even gather the data to prove that's increasing which by itself is a serious indictment in their capacity to run the system without data how can you operate moving away now from the medical aspects of cannabis I want to ask you about the industrial applications of the cannabis plant or hemp as its referred to in its industrial context you've been involved in the hemp industry so what can you tell us about that we started our version of the industrial head movement started in 1988 it took a full 20 years before we got the law change in 2018 New South Wales the industrial impact was brought into being and now it's relatively easy to grow a crop of hemp with some unnecessary restrictions but it's relatively easy although the federal government seems determined that the industry not go forward and they're doing this by restricting the sale of the hemp seed as a human food now Australia and New Zealand are the only countries on earth that restrict hemp seed as a human food despite the fact that the most nutritionally balanced and beneficial food on the planet in Australia or New Zealand we're not allowed to sell it and having that regulation in place has a severe impeding effect on the development of the hemp industries Abbott and Howard back in nineteen 2002 blocked our first application Abbott blocked it last year and now Turnbull's on a go slow but the fact remains whether the last two countries on earth to go this way so how serious are our governments about good health and what about the other industrial applications of hemp are they profitable just to use Canada as an example I mean Canada started growing hemp seed for food use I think in about 1996-97 at the same time we got our research licenses now the industry sort of worked close to half a billion dollars and growing at an exponential rate yeah it's a big industry in China the hemp textile industry is a major export industry so it's not on the scale of acrylic and things like that but it's a major industry and growing well not in Australia because we've destroyed our infrastructure years ago our hope was to establish a hemp industry not only seed for food but the bast or the long fibre as a textile but since we started in the late 1990s basically all Australian spinning mills have closed because of government policy and we now don't have a spinning industry so we've had to go without that hemp rebuilding is a very exciting area in Australia it is ideally suited to hempcrete construction because it's fire-proof termite-proof and has better thermal acoustic insulation the most other material so we hope to make a little bit of mileage over the next few years there but there's a lot of potential for and plastics we're being held back again by lack of investment in the head plastics all the works been done by own CSIRO to make quality hemp plastics free of all the toxic chemicals that are in petrochemical plastics but you know we're caught in this limbo because the financial interests also control the reigns of investment money and if you want to go and dig a new coal mine and you can find half a billion dollars at the drop of a hat but if you want to set up a hemp non wood paper mill that's a lot harder because the corporations are owned the money are the corporations that dig the coal basically and that is the whole problem with having a banker as your Prime Minister they're actually the enemy of the earth it all sounds fantastic so the question remains who is working against cannabis and making use of it in all these industrial and medical applications you won't find it hard for some of the gangsters they don't talk to that little [ __ ] bed for instance you know he's talked about he's gone and held my patients I'm indicia Stevens I promised a dad who's didn't died of cancer he promised he'd look after her ask bad how many kids have received cannabis under his proposals right and what he's doing about that what he's doing about disha Stevens that would be a nice question was a little prick for a hit Daniel Andrews the premier of Victoria's held one of my patients and promised to do as much as he can that was 12 months ago if it wasn't for us growing and providing that all be dead rights as simple as that they would be dead but now I mean since we started treating him it's not only alive but he's actually starting to get skills they said it never Wharf now he's armed you know we've had lots of that stuff and again you're not the only person having terrific results in supplying cannabis to people in medical need Marc Heinrich for instance was having terrific results with an epileptic child in Canberra until the police raided him do you know Marc and his story I was certainly involved when he was persecuted by Katie Gallagher for reporting how well he done with sherry devil and it's interesting Sherry's little child ABI has very rare and severe form of epilepsy cdk l5 has been completely stabilized on CBD medicine and it's ironic now that her son Wyatt the five-year-old with severe autism destructive behavioural patterns he's been well controlled by the same medicine and is now finding resistance from the doctors who don't want to accept that we've actually got a way of intervening and calming some of the brain inflammation that's associated with autism well it's crazy to think that people wouldn't want to look deeper into the link between cannabis and autism or cannabis and medical conditions in general but you see things like the stoner sloth campaign and it's clear that some people are still very very anti cannabis and just to finish up on this this point what do you make of the stoner sloth campaign there's two significantly different points here right I remind them firstly that cannabis was banned in the 1930s because it was meant to give heightened energy and people became uncontrollably violent and aggressive and it was only by the sixties when they realized that wasn't true that they change it to the sloth mentality but we have to remind people how many high level achievers have been pot smokers right there's many in fact it's not a musician on the stage that hasn't smoked pot basically so you know it's another bit of the reefer madness hysteria you know go on us and why aren't you replaying the 1930s when you became a sort of an uncontrolled sex monster or something like that right it comes and goes the other thing is because of the prohibition the ratio of the cannabinoids in the plant has changed dramatically so in the last 30 years there's been no CBD content in the cannabis what we have found by a small addition of cannabidiol or CBD to the cannabis the side effects associated with THC dominant cannabis and there are side effects associated with ADD like paranoia anxiety tachycardia memory loss things like that and mine and all transient but once the CBD is added to the pot they'll iterated so in fact the prohibition has may become a self-fulfilling prophecy okay so they've altered the pot by the prohibition so I was not properly grown anymore and then said see we told you is dangerous it's a nonsense really right and it's funny that this campaign came from New South Wales health which is the very same government department putting in 12 million dollars supposedly to research medical cannabis they put in nothing right I've given the squandered money to Sydney University with a 20-year track record of doing nothing of value and I also remind the viewers that it was Sydney Uni professor Mac Christie back in 1990 when I first proposed that we actually create a medical cannabis business here based around CBD the therapeutic effects of CVD he then went on the record as saying that CBD had no medical effect whatsoever and that the proposal had no merit I mean that's the quality of the advice you get from Sydney University at this stage having said that we do welcome the the establishment of a so-called center of excellence but with the people's track record there's no actual reason to believe they'll do anything spectacular see there's a big difference between scientific progress and compassionate access right on all in favour of scientific study I mean we're treating epileptic children and we're getting good results but they're not fantastic I mean we're benefiting three-quarters of the people a quarter of them are missing out you know we can always improve what we do and we need science for that but the New South Wales government specifically care each and prohibited Sydney Uni from doing analysis on the cannabis medicines we're currently using as way of improving our quality control right so there's a big difference between promising someone else's money which is what the government has done promising the public's money to do some wanking research whereas that 12 million could supply enough compassionate cannabis to treat every epileptic child in the country without any problem and there'd be a huge hundreds of millions of dollars of saving in medical costs there's no rationale to here off and that brings us to the end of the episode today you've been listening to music weird and cheese we'd like to give a shout out to our sponsors a tear riser a riser is a vaporizer company stationed in Canada and supplying quality vaporizers to people all around the world at affordable prices thank you very much Arizer and thank you for listening we'll see you again next time on music weed and cheese you
LdECwQ-seSg,"Justin Sinclair - Herbalist, Pharmacognosist &amp; Educator",2016-06-07T14:29:06Z,"without too much further ado what I really want to do is introduce our first speaker in a speech called cannabis 101 an introduction to the history botany and chemistry which is going to be incredibly interesting and he's a lovely bloke - justin sinclair justin has spent decades exploring the diverse field of herbal medicines around the world from both scientific and traditional perspective his qualifications include a Bachelor of Health Science from the University of New England a masters of herb or medicine from the Faculty of pharmacy at Sydney University and diplomas in nutrition and herbal medicine our key areas of study in his master's degree include a toxicology pharmacology analytical phytochemistry medicinal botany and pharmaceutical technology how good was that sentence by the way I practiced that for a long time well you got it when you're real a person working in education since 2003 justin has taught across a wide variety of subject matter he has also worked as a technical consultant in the complementary health care industry since 2006 in the fields of new product design regulatory affairs and research and development jason has been published in peer-reviewed journals and textbooks on the topics of herbal medicine pain management and herb-drug interactions has been an executive director and examiner for the National herbalist Association of Australia and currently sits on the scientific advisory board for both that United in compassion and bias Souter calls ladies and gentlemen please welcome our first speaker Justin Sinclair thanks for the kind introduction Tim and God sitting through those introductions is painful I'll try and live up to even a quarter of that but good morning ladies and gentlemen I'm incredibly excited to be able to talk to you today about a topic that has been far too long in coming to the forefront of public debate and represents a relatively unknown and greatly underutilized chapter in our recent medical and pharmacological history as a lecturer in the field of Pharma cognizant botany for the last 10 years I've been patiently waiting for such a time to rise so it gives me great pleasure to be able to have the privilege to talk to you today not only am i excited but absolutely humbled to be able to listen to the amazing collection of speakers that have flown from all over the world to be here to share their knowledge at this time in the evolution of medicinal cannabis in this great country of ours so the push for the use of medicinal cannabis for Australian patients suffering a wide range of serious medical conditions has been a very long and arduous road and it's largely because of the tidal wave of public support from people like you that this has actually come so far so quickly a 2015 poll conducted by Roy Morgan research suggests that 91% of Australians are in support of medicinal cannabis for those that need it and on behalf of the countless patients their families friends carers and advocacy groups we sincerely thank you for your continuing interest and heartfelt support and based on that heartfelt support the Australian Government has taken its first steps to passing legislation for the growing and manufacturing of medicinal cannabis earlier this year with support from most political parties and for this we also need to thank our government representatives for keeping an open mind and heart and listening to the needs of those that are suffering this being said we can't rest on our laurels quite yet as it is really now that the hard work begins we now have an incredible opportunity to reinstate this plant to our medicinal pharmacopoeias dispel the inaccuracies that surround it and use the best of cutting-edge science to ensure it's quality safety and efficacy and we need to do so not only in a timely manner but with open and inquiring minds and a compassionate understanding for those for whom this entire scheme has been designed understanding that many of you have come here today to learn more about the therapeutic properties of cannabis and may have little knowledge of the plan itself my prep well my presentation has been designed to lay down some solid groundwork so that you can learn the most out of the talks that follow behind me consider it kind of like a wide-ranging introduction to the topic of medicinal cannabis during which I'll touch on things like botany morphology and the history of use of the plant and a few of the important myths and misconceptions that may be weighing on your minds after hopefully by then lulling you into a full sense of security and comfort I'll then discuss the more detailed aspects of phytochemistry and chemical synergy work my way through that list that you see up there and finish with the importance of patient centered treatment when it comes to using this plan with this being said must be must admit to feeling a little bit like a warm-up band for the Rolling Stones or Led Zeppelin when I see some of the names that are preceding me afterwards so these guys are leading many of them are leading the world in medical cannabis research and it's clinical use so people like Ethan russo bonnie goldstein dr. jeffery gergan ratha Robert Clark Christina Sanchez just to name a few who've made you know such an important trip and given freely at their time for this symposium it's based on the research and clinical experience of a lot of these speakers that we're learning more about this truly unique plant and I look forward to sitting in the audience alongside you when I'm done and enjoying listening from them from the next couple of days so in setting the stage for this talk I wanted to start with a quote by the German philosopher Arthur stop and how all truth passes through three stages first its ridiculed second it is violently opposed and third it is accepted as being self-evident so if you listen to the wide range of topics and speakers over this weekend I want you to ruminate on these questions and ponder two things how does this quote apply to cannabis in our recent history and perhaps more importantly where do you think it's currently situated within these three stages right now so before we get started looking at cannabis botany we need to have a brief touch on some of the terminology so that we can give you some context so botany is obviously the study of the study of plants and their physiology their function and relatively new science of things like plant genetics morphology is a branch of botany folks focusing specifically on the form shape or physical characteristics of plants so as you can see by that lovely picture up there of a cannabis inflorescence which is made up of many little florets this represents an example of morphology taxonomy on the other hand is a science of classification of all living things and harkens back to the great Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus it's based primarily on us observing the morphology of organisms and grouping those with simha similar physical attributes into divisions orders genesis and species let's face it we humans love to categorize organize and pigeonhole information into bite-sized pieces and it's the field of taxonomy that allows us to do this for example humans are classified as Homo sapiens from the Latin which apparently means wise person albeit if you watch the lightly news or have been observing the current US presidential election campaign of late you would be right to question if that is an entirely and for appropriate label for all people lastly kimo taxonomy is an emerging science that allows us with much greater detail to categorize plants indeed instead of just relying on plant morphology to properly attribute plants into their various families or divisions taxonomically we can now analyze their chemistry to look for associations and relay chibs so before we move on I noticed some of you are taking notes I just wanted to mention that I don't want to see any of you doing that because I this talk will be loaded up on you I see so you can download it and have access to the list of references within this presentation that you can look up read and research at your own time so just sit back and relax all right then so let's look at some botany the cannabase e family interestingly is a relatively small family of flowering plants encompassing only about 11 general and about a hundred and seventy different species so cannabis comes from the same family as another useful herbal medicine humulus lupulus known as hops so in herbal medicine hops is actually a mild sedative and hypnotic agent to assist in sleep much like cannabis is also so it's also a perhaps more importantly to us many Australians used as an agent in the manufacturing of beer so for all of you that enjoy a good ale or lager tonight know you're likely enjoying that refreshing taste because of a very close relative of the cannabis plant so currently in for many years we believe that there are largely two major species within the genus cannabis cannabis sativa and cannabis indica so the first name cannabis denotes the genus name and the second name the specific epithet denotes the species these two names together are known as the binomial so generally speaking the species name conveys information as to an identifying characteristic about the plant or perhaps tells us from where it comes from sativa means of the fields denoting it was largely cultivated in large crops much like we commonly call hemp today whereas indica on the other hand is letting us know that it originated from India and the regions surrounding it more to the point with so much in a breeding of cannabis species and selectively plant breeding programs producing hybrids and different strains it's almost a moot point to discuss what species are useful for certain medicinal conditions we really need to analyze the individual phytochemistry of the plant to know what it might be useful for an encourage various plant research projects map Cannabis genetics to understand this complex genus in much greater detail as such the taxonomic classification of cannabis is one that is constantly unfolding and has been the subject of great academic debate over the past few decades the ability to use this chemical analysis is bringing much more information to light with recent scholarly works in this field changing the way we view the taxonomy of the family altogether including various new subspecies but I'll touch on that a little bit later common names of those that are popularly used in everyday language of course so the problem with this though is that they're not very scientifically meaningful we've created all of these different names for various strains of cannabis but at the end of the day whether it's a low THC producing hemp rich plant rich in fiber or seeds or a resin rich drug variety they're all still species of cannabis and it doesn't serve the scientific community to be using common names interestingly and to prove this point marijuana was originally a Mexican term for cheap tobacco and had little to do with cannabis at all lastly we need to focus on the different parts of the plant of industrial and medicinal use but I'll cover this in more detail as we move through the next few slides and highlight some of the different morphological characteristics of the cannabis genus so this is a map of the present-day ranges of the cannabis gene pool worldwide here you notice the proposed new subspecies down the bottom here within the cannabis genus breaking it down into narrow and broad lead varieties that are utilized primarily as either drug types or for food fiber and seed production worthy of note here is that in zones that are capable of supporting plant life on that map you will see that cannabis is present second is that cannabis is seen on every major inhabited continent because Aaron's ancestors took it with them wherever they went such was its value and need they needed it as a staple and revered it for its versatility therapeutic effectiveness and hardiness it's a very robust plant resilient to many different pests and conditions I mean come on they don't call it weed for nothing okay now let's have a look at some of the different morphological characteristics of the cannabis genus so that we can see what it looks like so note that both of these leaves look quite similar of course they both share the classic tip of the cue minute apex that you see up the top compound leaf structure and a serrated leaf margin but the length width and chemical characteristics are markedly different in these two plants whether broad or narrow leaf species or subspecies both share medicinal and and industrial applications did you know that the leaves are generally regarded as a waste product in cannabis cultivation however anecdotal reports of patients juicing them and obtaining therapeutic benefit from this because of the higher concentration of THC a has been observed and is certainly worthy of further scientific investigation here on the left you see a photo of a male cannabis plant the stamens are comprised of a filament upon which the anther sits and produces the pollen as you can see in Figure six can either male cannabis plant does produce quite a large amount of pollen and this can travel great distances on the wind and for this reason it's generally kept isolated from the female plants accepted breeding is desired if a female plant gets pollinated it will produce large amounts of seeds which detract from its ability to produce larger amounts of phytochemicals and may negatively impact medicinal potency as such the standard for producing medicinal strains of cannabis is to ensure that only unfertilized female plants commonly known as sensimilla is cultivated and generally cuttings or clones are taken from these unfertilized mother plants so that they have the identical genetic makeup and assist in maintaining consistent quality of the phytochemicals required you will notice how it looks like there's a hazy whitish coating on the female plant on the right this is not a mold or fungus but actually another morphological characteristic of the plant known as trichomes on this slide you can see two female cannabis plants there we go so on the left you can see the feathery looking female reproductive part known as the stigma this is the structure that the male pollen lands on and for fertilization to occur you can also see the glandular trichomes which have been magnified on the right this is where many of the phytochemicals of medicinal interest is stored within the cannabis plant mainly the cannabinoids and the terpenes hashish that some of you might have heard of is a resinous extract of just these glandular trichomes and represents a very strong end product that's being used in ritual ceremony and medicine by humans for thousands of years as it is essentially purified cannabinoids and turkeys much less is required to be used as a medicine in comparison to just crude dried plant material in Figure 10 here you see it finished trimmed in fluorescence commonly referred of course to as a bud covered in those crystalline glandular trichomes so this specific strain there on the left is known as Bubba cush as it pays homage to its ancestry being an inter codominant drug variety from the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan and famous for being a rich resin producing and height high in THC figure 11 right next to it is another rich resin strain known as Afghani Kush another variety known for sedation and pain relief now here's something quite unique about cannabis that you might not know both cannabis sativa and cannabis indica are known to be affected by what's known as photoperiodism which is defined as the developmental response or physiological action or reaction of a plant to the relative length of the daylight cycle most normal flowering plants go into our flower in warmer spring and summer months but not cannabis during spring and summer months when sunlight exposure is anywhere between 15 to 18 hours depending of course on your geographical location these plants undertake vegetative growth during this phase they maximize the growth of their leaves to produce carbohydrates through the process of photosynthesis which I'm sure you will remember from year 9 biology class so the process provides the fuel to increase the growth and vitality of the plant on this slide you can see a similar vegetative growth pattern but this time with much younger plants and under indoor lighting conditions so as the sunlight wanes as it heads into autumn and winter dropping down to about 10 to 12 hours a day this starts the process of flowering which is the main morphological structure of interest medicinally so this is why cannabis is suited to both outdoor growing and indoor growing as it's a simple matter of light exposure to change the plant from this vegetative to flowering stage now whilst my talk is mainly focusing on the medicinal uses and chemistry of cannabis it is worthy of note that cannabis has meaning has an incredibly long history of use as both a food and fiber it's thought that many ancient civilizations from the Asian and European regions have cultivated species of cannabis mainly for these reasons with some academics believing this history of use to date back over 10,000 years the seeds of cannabis produce a highly nutritious oil rich in omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids the oil can also be converted into a form of biodiesel to fuel cars and can even be used in manufacture of plastics the seeds also a great source of dietary protein for vegans and vegetarians the soft but highly durable fiber from the stalk of cannabis obtained from particularly the narrow leaf narrow leaf varieties such as cannabis sativa are commonly known as hemp so this fibers been used in ropes paper clothing for thousands of years and more recently have been used a manufacturer of affordable and thermally efficient housing in the form of hempcrete once again highlighting the versatility of this plant what you start to understand is that after looking at these industrial and food applications and taking into account the medicinal crops that could also be produced cannabis could be a wide-ranging and economically viable export crop potentially for our Aussie farmers so if you want to learn a little bit more about the many virtues of the non-medicinal aspects of the cannabis plant make sure and check out the diverse range of stalls just out there to your left as we were just speaking of history of use let's explore this topic briefly as well so many ethno botanist and academics believe that cannabis has been used throughout many regions of the world for over 10 millennia however obtaining hard proof of this is difficult to exactly quantify due to its cultivation and consumption predating the appearance of writing and human evolution written records exist but they only are found in certain cultures and at a much later date so cannabis is believed to have originated in the Central Asian region with nomadic peoples first coming across it when they entered its home range interestingly in geographical locations where cannabis was cultivated for fiber it was not used as a psychotropic or medicinal agent suggesting that different species or subspecies dispersal was in a very early time in our evolution this specific knowledge and growth of more broadleaf drug varieties seemed to have originated in the Himalayan region particularly near modern-day Afghanistan whereby it was disseminated to India China Asia Minor and North Africa and was likely a very valuable trade commodity seeds would have also been highly valued and allowed for the spread of this plan across the globe and if you want to learn more about the very early history of use of cannabis I'd highly recommend the book cannabis evolution and ethnobotany by Clark and Merlin so according to solid archaeological evidence cannabis has been in in China since the Neolithic period around 4000 BC it was first written off by the Emperor Shennong in his a compendium of medicinal herbs around 2700 BC and similar evidence has been found in the written histories of India because of the established trade routes throughout Asia in the Middle East this knowledge soon spread to the Mediterranean with the famous Greek physician / Dania style scurries dorita's also singing the praises of cannabis in his magnum opus de material which interestingly was used to teach medicine and physicians for the better part of 1,400 years so in more recent history cannabis was brought to the UK from India by British physician O'Shaughnessy in around 1839 after he observed its use as an effective appetite stimulant antiemetic muscle relaxant anticonvulsant and analgesic with even Queen Victoria being dispensed this plant for painful periods I mean talk about the Royal Seal of Approval yeah so it's use continued spreading and by 1854 it was included in the United States dispensary and was sold freely in the majority of Western countries still being available in most of them for more than a hundred years after that time unfortunately it was around 1937 that US authorities are condemned the use of cannabis after the lifting of alcohol prohibition and against the advice of the American Medical Association at the time passed the marihuana Tax Act which effectively made it illegal it was officially removed from the United States Pharmacopeia in 1942 and other Western countries such as Great Britain and most of Europe banned cannabis by adopting the United Nations Convention on psychotropic agents effectively categorizing cannabis in the same class as heroin so there you have it over ten thousand years of safe effective and valued use by our ancestors and when the signing of a piece of paper this plant disappeared from current use so I'm sure you can agree with me then that at least the use of medicinal cannabis is not so much a new discovery we're simply seeking to reinstate this incredibly diverse plant to her rightful place so with that being said let's look at some of the common questions that I'm sure that many of you have pondered about the potential dangers of cannabis and its safety so many of the questions that you see listed up here are some that I get asked most often by people on the topic of medicinal cannabis and are of course valid concerns the reality is that in many instances there is conflicting evidence available on many of these topics so I've done my best to present a balanced appraisal of this in the slides that follow so the intelligence quotient or IQ is based on standardized testing to assess human intelligence of which of course several tests exist it's long being touted that cannabis can actually reduce human IQ because it kills brain cells which are known as neurons whilst consumption of certain varieties of cannabis may indeed cause a decreased function in short-term memory these changes are not considered permanent and resolved with cessation so as a general rule of thumb guys you might want to stay clear of using cannabis before sitting any formal exams or if you're a contestant on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire but recently a review of two longitudinal twin studies conducted by Jackson and colleagues published earlier this year found that cannabis using twins failed to show significantly greater IQ decline relative to their abstinent siblings suggesting that observed declines in IQ are more attributable to familial or other factors more interestingly is that compounds within cannabis have actually been found to be neuroprotective in vitro test tube and animal studies are demonstrating that certain cannabinoids in cannabis such as CBD may reduce damage to the brain caused by lack of blood flow or oxygen supply and also assist in preventing the neurological degeneration seen in conditions such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease now whilst more research certainly needs to be conducted in human trials the preliminary results are certainly encouraging so I get to ask this one probably most of all does all cannabis get you high and the long and the short of it is that no it doesn't so compounds such as tetrahydrocannabinol are generally attributed with the psychoactive effect of making the user feel high or stoned narrow leaf drug varieties rich in CBD and lower in THC are incredibly useful medicines that do not cause this feeling which is why many people prefer to use the non psychoactive strains during the day to assist in managing their condition so as not to feel too affected allowing them to still hold down jobs and be productive and then they can save the stronger THC rich strains for nighttime use to help them sleep or deal with pain this level of individualization and specific specific strains of cannabis is one of the greatest strengths of this is a medicine don't so does this mean that THC is a potentially negative constituent I hear you ask and the answer is certainly not THC is the main constituent involved in pain relieving sedate sedative muscle relax and activities within cannabis and in the interest of fairness and comparing apples with apples let's not forget that pharmaceutical drugs such as the opiate class including medicines like morphine pethidine codeine or benzo benzodiazepine drugs such as valium both classes used in analgesia and muscle relaxation don't exactly leave you feeling normal either okay so what about the topic of cannabis causing dependence or being highly addictive so this is obviously an important topic and one that many patients and their carers medical professionals and politicians may be concerned about after reviewing sample sizes used in various studies I found this study conducted by Anthony Warner in Kessler in 94 which surveyed over 8,000 people in the USA between the ages of 15 and 54 and was designed to assess patterns of dependence a particular interest here is that cannabis can indeed cause dependency however let's look at the statistics a little close 24% of the study respondents with the history of dependence or one in four reported being dependent to tobacco was 14 percent or 1 in 7 reported dependence to alcohol as classified by the American Psychiatric Association's definition in the DSM so worthy of note here is that after seeing these previous statistics that only four percent reported dependence to cannabis six times less that then that about our tobacco now let's remember that both tobacco and alcohol illegally obtainable and socially acceptable and uh not illicit substances so many other facets also need to be considered here such as individual variability of the patient and why the cannabis is being used for example of someone suffering from chronic intractable pain that is non-responsive to pharmaceutical medication I think it's reasonable to assume that the patient might get dependent to this plant for pain relieving activity on a daily basis so this now leads us to the next question does cannabis cause people to go on to use harder drugs and the evidence here is actually quite compelling so the idea of cannabis being a gateway drug is not new and not surprisingly there's a great deal of conflicting evidence in the scientific literature a gateway drug is defined as one that apparently can lead to the use of harder more addictive or dangerous drugs such as heroin or methamphetamines as examples firstly we need to consider that as cannabis is obtained from the black market due to its current illegality it stands to reason that other illicit drugs of a harder nature are also obtained from similar sources this simple association is potentially difficult to remove in studies as a confounding variable in California a state that's legalized medical cannabis dispensaries patients can access just medicinal cannabis with a card from their authorized provider a study conducted in California in 2008 that you see here was on 350 registered medicinal cannabis users and found that cannabis may actually serve as an exit drug and not a gateway drug let's have a look at some of the figures so forty percent of the respondents reported using cannabis as a substitute for alcohol which we already know has a higher dependency rate twenty-six percent used it as a substitute for other illicit drugs and 66 percent used it as a substitution for prescription medication now further findings also suggested that 65% of patients use medicinal cannabis due to the propensity for less side effects thirty-four percent due to the less withdrawal effects and 57 percent felt that it provided better symptom management for their specific medical conditions now I need to be clear here in state that stopping certain pharmaceutical medications without close communication and monitoring by your qualified medical practitioner is not a wise nor responsible thing so open and frank communications always best to keep your clinician informed and used safe now in the interest of balance this was only a small study but it does propose a counter-argument against the traditional viewpoint and whilst on this topic new evidence has been shown that medicinal cannabis use is associated with a decrease in pharmaceutical opioid deaths the CDC in the USA posted that in 2010 over 16,000 people died from pharmaceutical opioid analgesics which equates to roughly 45 people per day and that opioid overdoses have droople from the year 2000 to 2014 almost two million in 2014 sorry almost two million Americans abused or were dependent on prescription opioids and from the period 1999 to 2014 more than a hundred and sixty-five thousand of them have died from overdoses related to prescription opioid medications lastly every day a thousand people are treated in US emergency rooms nationwide for misusing these prescription prescriptive drugs now bark uber and colleagues published a paper in the the American Medical Association this year which was clearly demonstrating that statement is medicinal cannabis laws in the USA are associated with a statistically significant lower state level opioid overdose mortality rate which supports the findings presented in the Reimann statistics above and also supports the cannabis may well be an exit drug in certain circumstances now what about this question can cannabis cause psychosis or schizophrenia psychosis can be both a symptom by itself or a feature of mental illness it's characterized by being unable to distinguish what is real or losing contact with reality and interestingly according to the Saint Australia website most people recover from such episodes the causes of psychosis are not fully understood but involve a complex interplay of individual genetics physical environmental and psychological factors so there's been a large amount of articles proposing that cannabis can indeed cause psychosis and schizophrenia however in a review article published this year by Sir and Hart it was proposed that the evidence reviewed from previous studies suggests that cannabis does not in itself cause a psychotic disorder rather the evidence led the researchers to conclude that both early use and heavy use of cannabis are more likely in individuals with a vulnerability to psychosis so more research obviously is needed to be conducted in this area to fully understand the relationship and we must also consider the quality or strain of the cannabis that was being used if it was adulterated with other illicit substances and the dose that was being taken as predisposing variables so this is an interesting topic as anyone that studied the human body and toxicology will tell you that many mundane things can actually be characterized as harmful even drinking too much water can kill you so after looking at the findings for cannabis causing psychosis I think we have to accept that it could be of course be harmful given the right circumstances and in certain individuals and perhaps more likely that it can cause changes in perception that if given the right environment such as operating heavy machinery may cause an increased chance of harm to self or harmed others so but let us so this being said it's difficult to find accurate statistics about actual deaths caused by cannabis alone in Australian datasets a report issued by the Vic Road Safety Department estimated roughly that cannabis intoxication alone was responsible for about 4.3 percent of driver fatalities so it's obvious that responsible use is an important topic in this discussion so data obtained from Australian datasets is hard to find because generally these datasets include multiple drugs that may have contributed to harm not you know such as alcohol or other illicit drugs not just the cannabis so as these are not separated out we don't get a completely accurate picture of the relative risk but can still see that based on these changes and perceived changes to mental perception we have to assume that risk of harm exists but let's now bring some statistics for comparative purposes that we do know quite well data obtained from the Australian Government's quit lines suggest that 50 Australians die every day from tobacco-related disease that's one every 28 minutes in 1998 alone over 19,000 deaths were attributed to tobacco use whilst in 1995 3.2 million Australians were identified at being a risk of chronic health conditions from tobacco smoking at the time this equated to a quarter of almost a quarter of the adult population so the impact not only on individual health but as a burden to the healthcare system could not be overlooked and the statistics guys for alcohol aren't that rosy either in 2010 there were four 5,500 deaths attributable to alcohol with an additional one hundred and fifty seven thousand hospitalizations in that same year so can cannabis cause potential harm the answer of course is yes but when comparing currently available statistics on cannabis related harm to those of the legal and socially acceptable alcohol and tobacco well guys in my opinion is kind of like comparing a fart to a cyclone okay so now that we've so now that we've addressed some of these important questions let's get back on track by looking at an incredibly important neuromodulatory system in the body that we would know actually nothing about unless it was for cannabis so before we get started looking into the phytochemistry of the plant it's important that we quickly review the system within the body with which these chemicals within cannabis interact so I'm only going to touch on this lightly as you have a world leading expert in this field coming after me dr. Ethan Rousseau and he'll be able to go into this in the intricacies of this very fascinating system in much greater detail than I so did you know that most medical curriculum is currently in university do not teach about this system the endocannabinoid system so I feel that very soon this is going to be changing so the endocannabinoid system in short is all about homeostasis this is a term used to describe how the body can regulate variables so that conditions remain relatively constant and stable it's all about balance so we could look at disease as being a shift away from homeostasis whereby the body can no longer maintain balance and as such start suffering from symptoms and signs that manifest as disease so due to the distribution of the under cannot cannabinoid system throughout the bay the brain spinal cord and other organs and tissues it plays a significant role in the regulating a broad list of physiological processes including the regulation of stress and emotions at digestion pain cardiovascular and immune function neurological development synaptic plasticity and learning memory bodily movement metabolism and energy expenditure inflammation appetite sleep wake cycles and even temperature regulation so fundamentally the EECS is comprised of three major components the cannabinoid receptors distributed throughout the various organs and tissues known as cb1 and cb2 receptors the endogenous chemicals which we call ligands that actually our own bodies produce that then bind with these receptors and lastly the enzymes which are involved in the synthesis and degradation of these ligands so it's the same receptors and others within the body that the fie cannabinoids that is the cannabinoids derived from the cannabis plant that they also interact with so as such any slight difference that we show in the expression of these components what we call inter-individual variability or genetic polymorphic modifications can potentially alter the physiology of the entire endocannabinoids system and therefore affect how cannabis might interact with all of us as individuals this highlights the complexity of cannabis pharmacotherapy in clinical application in 2015 I have the distinct pleasure of speaking on a radio program in Mendocino County in California with dr. Jeffery hergenrother a noted cannabis physician with decades of practice under his belt and one thing that he made quite clear and one that I wholeheartedly agree with is that cannabis may not be the panacea or cure-all that everyone thinks it is and has the potential to affect everyone differently we which should not make that much or be too much of a surprise for you considering that pharmaceutical drugs alcohol and even foods affect all of us differently depending on our individual genetic and physiological makeup I mean let's be honest we all know that one person that's up dancing on tables after two glasses of shadi and one that's up cleaning the house until 2:00 a.m. because they had a coffee after dinner so currently there's two main endocannabinoids that we've emerged in the research as prevalent regulators of synaptic function and this is an and amide and two AG now for any of you runners out there in the audience here's an interesting tidbit of information did you know that for decades scientists have attributed the feeling of runner's high with endorphins and these elevate mood reduce anxiety and reduce pain perception interestingly a research paper by fulsome colleagues in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last year demonstrated in an animal model that an and amide is highly elevated in running and likely also contributing to this effect so if proven true in humans the term high takes on whole new meaning so deaf definitions or by definition phytochemistry is the study and analysis of the many different chemicals that exist within plants so on this amazing planet there's approximately 240,000 different species of flowering plants and it's estimated that we've only actually looked at about 10,000 earnestly for medicinal virtue I'll just let that number sink in for you for a little while as I guide you through this part of the talk now that we've touched on the endocannabinoid system let's take a look at the finer chemicals within cannabis that can interact with these endocannabinoid receptors and not only cannabinoids but other pharmacological classes that can contribute therapeutically via other mechanisms of action so you've all probably heard of the psychoactive cannabinoid Delta 9 THC or tetrahydrocannabinol and also maybe cannabic cannabidiol CBD which is gaining a great deal of media attention of late because of its anticonvulsant activity in assisting with epilepsy management but there are numerous other cannabinoids and other phytochemical classes within the plant that are also of clinical interest alright so let me take you through this diagram it was so worth of me putting up there I just really enjoyed looking at the looks on your faces so please indulge me there so now things I must admit are going to get a little bit more technical but I promise I'm going to make this as pain-free as possible so kind of think of it like pulling off a band-aid unfortunately it's going to be slowly done over about nine slides in ten minutes but we'll get there so let's move on to something that looks a little bit less like the lovechild of a chemistry textbook and a street map of sydney how about that I think that's much more manageable now cannabinoids are a class of what we call turpino phenolic compounds that occur in the cannabis plant so you can see why they're called turpino phenolic on this diagram so what they're in the right hand corner is a lava taluk acid which represents the phenolic moiety and on the left is geranyl pyrophosphate represents the terpene moiety now these come together to form cannibal bigger Olek acid which is the precursor for all other major cannabinoid acids now in its in this acid form which is largely carboxylated okay so meaning that they have carbon dioxide molecules attached to them which i've highlighted in blue for you so if you go skipping through a cannabis plantation picking inflorescences and eating them that cannabinoids exist in this acid form and you're not going to get high off it okay because the chemistry will not bind to the receptors but you may certainly obtain some other therapy benefit so far they've been over 60 different cannabinoids classified but this is largely dependent on the strain and species of cannabis being tested as they all demonstrate unique cannabinoid profiles which is subject to change based on variables such as temperature Sun like exposure soil pH and elevation so in the fresh plant if in these acid forms that exist not their end products which is what we predominantly want to use as medicine such as THC and CBD so once we dry and cure the plant material or expose it to heat such as with smoking vaping or baking edible dosage forms these carboxyl groups highlighted in blue hybrid vibrate at a very very high frequency and they actually snap off so this releases carbon dioxide and allows for the new decarboxylated product that is formed to interact with various cannabinoid receptors and other receptor types so think of it kind of like a lock-and-key as long as the carboxyl group is attached the key cannot quite fit but once removed this is rectified here we see how this decarboxylation process changes the non psychoactive tetrahydrocannabinol ik acid or THC a into the psychoactive Delta 9 THC but this same process exists for other plant like acids like cannabidiol ik acid being converted into CBD so it's not without good reason of course that THC and CBD are perhaps the best known of the fighter cannabinoids not only were they some of the first cannabinoids to be elucidated chemically but they have also had the lion's share of research conducted on them so here we see a small snapshot of some of the actions attributed to them coming from in vitro in vivo and human clinical studies now THC binds with relatively high affinity to both the cb1 and cb2 receptors in the central nervous system very similar to that of our own endogenous met endogenously manufactured and and mined so this constituent is associated with the feeling of psycho activity and if given in high isolated doses can cause dysphoria and potential paranoia and anxiety in certain individuals pharmacologically THC is a well described analgesic and the management of pain relay - cancer muscle spasm migraine phantom limb pain spinal cord injury damaged nerves and even been used post surgery after post surgery pain it's also shown benefit in assisting with the muscle spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis and perhaps is best known as an appetite promoting agent for cancer and AIDS patients and also in reducing the nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy less well known as evidence supporting its use for lowering intraocular pressure and eye condition known as glaucoma and for reducing symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease tomorrow at noon dr. Christina Sanchez will speak about the therapeutic potential of medicinal cannabis in cancer for which THC is believed to hold to be a very important constituent contributing significantly to this activity CBD on the other hand is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid and actually opposes the dysphoric effects of THC which is why it is a benefit to have the two constituents present in varying amounts depending on the therapeutic condition that's being treated unlike THC CBD has very low binding affinity for cb1 and cb2 receptors but rather works by a different mechanisms of action such as being an agonist for serotonin which may explain why it exhibits such good antidepressant and anxiety activity due to CBDs antioxidant anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective actions it holds great interest in the treatment of seizures epilepsy Parkinson's disease Huntington's disease multiple sclerosis and also Alzheimer's as I'm sure you've noticed the fact that some of these pharmacological actions are highlighted in blue is showing how these actions are shared between these two constituents albeit in many cases this will be by different mechanisms of action or by interacting with different receptors I want you to tuck this away in your memory for a little bit and I'll pull on that soon but this is just 2 cannabinoids out of the 60 that have been characterized within this plan but what about the other cannabinoids I hear you say so these are these are also of great value in their own right and we need to encourage research into these to learn more about their complex interrelationships not only within the plant and also their therapeutic potential for different conditions so worthy of note here is some of the minor cannabinoids such as Delta THC which exhibits less psycho activity than delta-9 but still expresses many of the same useful therapeutic activities of its stronger cousin tetrahydrocannabinol or THC B exhibits anticonvulsant activity similar to CBD and can-can a bit of Aaron is also of interest in improving glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetes which is currently obviously occur a major public health problem in developed countries around the world whereas can-can a banal and canna bigger all share the ability to decrease proliferation of charata sites and therefore shows some great therapeutic promise in the skin condition known as psoriasis so whilst a large amount of these actions are of course demonstrated only in animal or in vitro models it really does highlight how much more there is to this plant from a research perspective and that it's not just about THC and CBD so this was eight of the 60 cannabinoids that we briefly looked at let's now have a look at a completely different pharmacological class of compounds known as the terpenes so as I'm sure you remember the terpenes are found and held within the same glandular trichomes of the cannabis plant that the cannabinoids are so it's this phytochemical class that largely contributes to the unique tastes and smells associated with the different cannabis strains you can think of these as like the essential oils of the cannabis plant producers and they're not unique to the cannabis plant that are commonly ubiquitously and abundantly distributed throughout many different plant families and species so how many of you like the smell of lemons so this is lemon een and it's responsible for the smell of many citrus species so what you might not know about this little terpene is that it packs quite a therapeutic punch by not only having strong anxiety can even antidepressant activities but also showing evidence for use in gastroesophageal reflux disease and has moderate antibacterial activity and has also been shown to produce cell death in breast cancer cells now these antioxidant and anxiety activities highlighted in blue are also shared with CBD but occur via a different mechanism so having multiple phytochemicals within a plant that exhibit similar similar pharmacological activity increases the therapeutic potential of the medicine and is something that has been used long-term in herbal medicine and known as phytochemicals synergy then we have been immersing so this monitor peon exhibits muscle relaxant sedative anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions which as you know are also both shared by CBD and THC so to many of you like the clean scent of pine needles okay if so then you can thank alpha pine in for that so this monitor pain exhibits anti-inflammatory bronchodilator activities which as you guessed it is also shared by the two major cannabinoids so many other terpenes exist with over 200 being identified in cannabis alone another worthy of note that not described above is the sedative and soothing qualities of Lin Ahlul which is also seen in lavender so this calming terpene is useful in anxiety and has also been found in a 1995 study to have anticonvulsant activity so did you know that currently in the USA at the moment the unique terpene profiles exhibited by different cannabis strains are incredibly popular with medical users not only because they make the medicine taste and smell quite unique but because they feel these strains offer a wider range of therapeutic effect so as you can see there exists a great deal of crossover when it comes to just these two phytochemical classes that being said over 700 different phytochemicals have been characterized across various cannabis strains so the diversity of pharmacological actions and potential benefit for many different health problems is easy to see so here are just a handful of the other phytochemical classes that come from this plan worthy of note are the flavonoids which exhibit widespread anti-inflammatory activity so I'm not going to bore you any more with too much detail because I think I've expressed just how complex and incredible this plant really is you can literally grow a specific plant or strain that expresses a certain phytochemical profile and then manufacture medicines that will harness the broad range of chemistry available for that specific strain so this idea that different plants or their constituents can interact with each other is not a new idea ancient traditional systems of medicines such as aya beta from India and traditional Chinese medicine would combine certain herbs together to increase therapeutic effect or decrease certain side effects so this concept known as synergy is still employed by herb or medicine practitioners and naturopaths today what's interesting however is that we now have scientific proof of the validity of this mechanism and not surprisingly much of this work has been done based around cannabis pioneering researchers in the field of cannabis professor ben shabbat and later dr. raphaela shulam turned this type of interactive synergy the entourage effect dr. Ethan Rousseau he'll be speaking later has also published on this topic talking about the potential synergy between cannabinoids in the terpene class in his landmark paper that you see up there taming THC so the concept of herbal synergy or this entourage effect is based on the premise that phytochemicals interact in a dynamic and meaningful way to provide a stronger or more modified effect when used in combination so the mechanisms by which this could occur are many and variable with Wagner and Ulrich Masonic proposing that the following potential synergistic mechanisms so for multi target effects we've already touched on this previously consider the way the anti-inflammatory actions of CBD THC and certain terpenes and flavonoids have a stronger effect being used in combination yet all doing so by slightly different mechanisms of action or receptors within the body simply put pharmacokinetics is defined as what the body does to the drug after it enters the body so this process is largely controlled by the liver and depends on the type of dosage form that's being used such as oral ingestion or intravenous administration both of which would be absorbed metabolized and excreted by the person in different ways now pharmacokinetic effects are incredibly important and include how and where a substance is absorbed how it's distributed throughout the body by our blood tissues and fluid and how how it's broken down and metabolized by the liver and lastly how it's excreted out of the body interestingly we all as individuals execute these four functions slightly differently depending on our genetics and physiological makeup so it also includes the substances that may improve bioavailability and assimilation so this is a really interesting synergistic mechanism as depending on the constituents involved we may witness increased absorption of various cannabinoids if they're used in combination for example certain terpenes have been shown to increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier potentially causing a faster onset of action which could be very useful in pain management so this may actually mean that less medicine is needed by increasing the absorption and availability of it within the body lastly the modulation of adverse effects is also an important mechanism of synergy and I have already discussed one earlier how CBD cannabis oppose the dysphoric effects of THC in isolation so this naturally brings us to a discussion about single active medicines and full-spectrum medicines or for single and full akhtar full-spectrum extracts so now let me be clear by saying that single active cannabis based medicines work for many people medicines such as epidural x a purified single active or plant derived CBD is being used and trialed for epilepsy and children with dravet syndrome as another example Knab alone which is a synthetic laboratory made cannabinoid medicine mimicking the structure of THC has been used as an antiemetic and analgesic for neuropathic pain problem is it's also associated with a broad range of adverse effects such as a tack SIA headache nausea dizziness and sleep disturbance Marinol also known as dren abinell is another synthetic THC derivative used for increasing appetite nades patients and reducing the nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy but also has an adverse effect profile associate associated with it potentially causing seizures a story shared by many patients i've spoken to over the years in my travels overseas in the US is that they preferred full-spectrum extracts due to better therapeutic effect and less side effects at the very least patients should have access to both single and full-spectrum extracts as it should be about what gets results for the individual so the term whole plant extract is often used interchangeably with full-spectrum the term is this term I find a little confusing because it implies that the whole of the plant is actually used in the manufacturing process that is the roots and all of the above-ground parts which we know is simply not true this is why I prefer the term full-spectrum extract as its denoting that a full spectrum of active constituents from a plant based product is being utilized not just as a single active so and as we've seen already this entourage effect has many potential benefits so whilst active single actives can be a benefit let me paint a bit of a picture for you as I walk you through this analogy which after your brief introduction into phytochemistry today should make sense so single CBD or THC actives can be thought of as a gladiator walking out into the Coliseum with a large sword but clad only in a loin cloth the sword of course is the single active that is at a standardized does full-spectrum extracts would be the heavily armed and fully armored counterpart that has more phytochemistry and the entourage affected its disposal I think you get the point this leads us now to talk about dosage forms and its cannabinoids and other pharmacologically active phytochemicals within the kept the plants such as the terpene class a highly lipophilic meaning that their fat soluble the dosage form of how the cannabis is administered is also very clinically relevant for the individual patient and condition being treated this may determine the difference between treatment failure and amelioration of symptoms and also other factors such as duration of effect potency and speed of onset for example orally ingested THC rich dosage forms will undergo bio transformation in the liver to a slightly stronger form but this will take 30 to 60 minutes to take effect so this will provide a longer duration of activity which is great whereas smoking or vaping a similar strain will provide much quicker onset of action but a shorter duration of effect what's great about this is that multiple dosage forms could be used utilized by individual patients based on the disease or condition that they have and it's symptom expression leaving the ability to individualize treatment and titrate dose accurately for the individual the correct dosage form is an integral component of ensuring effective medicinal cannabis strategy and yet another variable that clinicians and patients need to navigate together however it doesn't need it does need to be mentioned that not all of these that are listed that you see have been well studied and not all at large amounts of clinical evidence which leads to our next topic whilst I simply do not have the time here to go into a comprehensive amount of detail about scientific levels of evidence I do want to talk about the importance of different kinds of evidence in being able to assess efficacy of treatments and collecting meaningful data particularly when it comes to medicinal cannabis now there's a wide range of different types of scientific studies epidemiological studies non-randomized are qualitative studies case control studies cross-sectional studies retrospective and cohort studies and lastly case studies all of them are useful for collecting data but they have an exhibit different levels of robustness so speaking of which if you're interested in contributing to research currently being conducted check out the Australian medicinal cannabis Observatory survey at that link below that Lucy was talking about previously data that's obtained from this will help researchers here in Australia understand how cannabis is currently being used for medicinal purposes now the three that I want to touch on quickly here are listed so the randomized control trial what we call the RCT is considered by many to be the gold standard on clinical study testing and there are currently being set up for testing various cannabis treatments for different disorders in Australia right now and I think it's a fantastic that Australia is actually getting behind cannabis research and contributing to the evidence pool in the medicinal cannabis field internationally RC teas are used to test the effectiveness of treatments by reducing selection bias by using randomization and using two groups one that receives the treatment and the other that does not and at the end of the study the statistics are compared these statistics have been either of large small p-value which determines the significance or meaning of those results then you have what many consider the top level of evidence which is a systematic review as this is assessing results over many RCTs it's critically analyzing available data using transparent procedures and reporting on these results assisting in compiling a critical evidence base that shapes the way drugs or interventions are used in practice now with many thousands of research papers having already been conducted on cannabis in the literature it would be wise I believe for the federal government to Commission an independent systematic review on cannabis use consisting of experts across many fields to highlight what areas require more research and those that do not therefore saving valuable time and money and not replicating studies where evidence currently exists and therefore speeding the access and therefore speeding the access of medicinal cannabis across a wide range of diseases or conditions soon on whilst the RCT and systematic review design are incredibly robust it's not without flaws our CTS are generally quite time-consuming often taking years to complete and very expensive to conduct often costing millions of dollars there's also the problem with conflicts of interest who is funding the research and the potential for manipulation of statistical data this has become highlighted in recent years with several editors of prestigious peer-reviewed journals and respected academics suggesting that it's simply no longer possible to believe all of the clinical research that is published so hopefully with more rigor and transparency this will stop from continuing in the future lastly our CTS are also concerned a little bit more with statistical significance and less on clinical significance that is the impact on the individual patient and with this I can segue into what is known as the end of one trial with which many believe to be the future of patient centered medicine so unfortunately the end of one study has not been given a great deal of attention in current research models but if designed well they can still gain large amounts of meaningful data with everyone or everything that you've looked at so far today I'm sure that's easy to see how a one-size-fits-all approach is not going to do patients nor cannabis is a medicine any justice we can certainly make standardized doses of certain constituents which will assist some people but it will not assist all of us as such we try to standardize testing or as much as we try to standardize testing to apply to the human organism one fact remains unchanged and that is that we're all different take a look around the room for a minute just as we do not look the same so too do we all function and express our anatomy and physiology with slight differences sure we have the same organs tissues and bones but the way that they function at a cellular tissue and organ level can be different from person to person throw this into the mix then with different phytochemicals spectrums dosage forms and dosage of cannabis and it's at least clear to me that the nf1 study and medicinal cannabis seems to be a match made in heaven putting the patient first and foremost and allowing for an individual ization of treatment that can be optimized based on changes in recorded outcome measures so this brings us to a bit of a mantra that we use at UIC and hopefully after listening to my talk today you can understand why it's really all about finding the right strain of cannabis optimized for phytochemicals for the right patient and health condition given in the right dosage form and given at the right dose so as I draw this talk to a close and speaking as a member of the UIC scientific advisory board I wanted to highlight that UIC is fervently committed to a high quality cannabis cultivation and manufacturing industry in Australia with the main mission being to supply high quality cannabis to the sick and suffering that need it as such I wanted to discuss some key points that are important for consideration and form the backbone of our core beliefs firstly we support the use of both indoor and outdoor growing facilities for the cultivation of medicinal cannabis certain strains certainly do grow well indoors whereas others grow rather tall and flourish outside under natural sunlight which is how they've evolved over millions of years outdoor growing is also naturally more resistant to fungus and much more environmentally friendly for those worried about the security about door grow operations large greenhouses utilizing supplemental lighting can certainly be considered as a workable and proven solution we encourage an open and transparent process involving many stakeholders to help come to such decisions secondly we're passionate about the use of sustainable organic cultivation methods being an inhaled and ingested medicine means the raw herb must be as clean and pure as possible using more so using more natural agents not only in pest control but also in soil preparation is also both environmentally sustainable and environmentally responsible third we absolutely advocate for the use of naturally occurring cannabis species landraces and hybrids for medicinal use we should not be restricting medicinal strains to certain strains as every patient and condition is unique and we should also be encouraging cannabis plant breeding projects to continue research and improve strain development in a natural way we do not support genetically modified cannabis in any way shape or form so lastly we do not advocate for the laboratory manufactured synthetic cannabinoids this is not because of lack of evidence we simply continue to support the use of dried flower and crude spectrum full-spectrum extracts the way it's been used for thousands of years and would encourage researchers to investigate these dosage forms with as much Derna sness please as they do single active extracts so as I scroll through the over 60 scientific references that I utilized for this talk today which is actually represents a mere drop in the ocean I give thanks to the hundreds of researchers working around the world that have contributed to getting us to understand this plan a little better we don't need to reinvent the wheel here guys we just need to perfect it so when I get to this last slide finishing up with a quote so have a read of that let's finish with this so when I first read this it made me think how truth is incredibly persistent but in a patient way no matter what you do to it it always finds a way to show itself we don't need to defend cannabis both science and patient outcomes we'll do this naturally all of us have a unique opportunity here today as its you that represent the keys to releasing this line from its cage keep an open mind educate yourselves and let's work together to achieve two things let's bring this queen this green queen back out of exile and by so doing return some dignity and hope to those that need it most so my warm-up duties are now done I know it's been my sincere pleasure to shed a little light on the potential for this truly dynamic plan thank you for your kind attention thank you very much Justin and before you go lucy has a small presentation for you that was absolutely wonderful I'm exhausted I just can't believe how much knowledge this man has and how lucky we are to have him on our scientific advisory board thanks Jessica and on a more personal note I'm incredibly impressed with the number of God's words you use during that talk you"

qcm2t8wgRng,Dr Ilan Linder MD,2016-06-09T11:58:52Z,dr. Ellen Linda who is also from Israel he's reporting on the findings of a pediatric epilepsy program in Israel dr. Ellen Linder studied medicine at ben-gurion University in Beersheba graduating in 1998 his postdoctoral education included a residency and internship in pediatrics and later in pediatric neurology and child development at Edith Wolfson Medical Center in Hollen Israel at Professor tele Lerman sergey's pediatric neurology unit currently he heads the pediatric epilepsy clinic his hospital work consists of consultations and specialized clinics such as catastrophic epilepsies and the metabolic genetic neurology clinic he teaches and guides medical students and pediatric interns and medical nurses in the field of epilepsy he also practices pediatrics and pediatric neurology in the community dr. Linda's first encounter in the field of medical cannabis during a show first encountered the field of medical cannabis during a multi-sensor trial treating pediatric epilepsy patients with cannabinoid oil extracts and vaporized cannabis he leads a pediatric neurology branch dr. Linda recently spoke at the Israeli League against epilepsy annual meeting in January to 2016 sharing his experiences in treating pediatric epilepsy patients with vaporized cannabis he is a member of the pediatric neurologists committee in the Ministry of Health structuring guidelines for the use of medical cannabis in pediatric epileptic patients with oil extract and vaporized cannabis ladies and gentlemen please welcome dr. Ilan Linda good morning everyone my name is Ellen lyndale I'm a pediatric neurologist from Holland Israel first I would like to tell to thank the USC Lucie for inviting me here to Australia and also Troy Michelle of course for assisting me all the way thanks but especially I would like to thank all of you ladies and gentlemen for making the effort and coming here this morning sorry I will talk to you about our observational study that we have been conducting for the past two years evaluating the effects medical cannabis has on children with intractable epilepsy I will talk about enriched CBD oil mixture with the THC CBD 1 to 20 ratio but also about our experience treating vaporized medical cannabis I tried to liven up my the facts and figures a little bit with clinical case reports which I hope will be interesting and I will conclude our learning with our learning experience and thoughts for future times my personal biography medical biography that is begins of 1998 when I graduated medical school and since then I'm effectively working in Edith Wolfson Medical Center it alone at the pediatric neurology units headed by Professor Tali segi I'm heading the pediatric epilepsy service there I'm also the proud father of three my eldest son is 18 and I have two daughters Laura 15 and 10 Israel and Australia have similarities many I think is the fact that both are immigrant nations I think this slide demonstrates it quite well if there were no writings on the plane and the ship below I I think hardly anyone could tell the differences between the hope that's expressed on the on the faces I hope over at the back you can see it as well personally my family came originated from Poland my surname Lindo has no meaning in Polish but in German it has two meanings the first beam and I won't tackle the botanist here it's the linden tree you see on the right and but the second which I was happy to embrace later on in my life that Linda or Linden means to heal possibly coming from the bark of the linden tree so I hope like many other speakers before me that you have heard before me that I will also give my share in the healing of all our patients if one observes epileptic patients one can soon find out that about 30% of them fit into the category of intractable epilepsy or drug-resistant epilepsy meaning that it is a failure to stop all seizures all daily seizures after an adequate trial of at least two antiepileptic drugs the efficacy of current medication in these cases is limited the options are few and varying between the ketogenic diet the vagal nerve stimulation the VNS or surgery when applicable we have joined forces so to speak in three medical centers mentioned before in the in the Tel Aviv area which is not as something which is easy to do with many physicians and before you is our first public the publication of our first year described in 76 patients treated with medical cannabis it was published in January at the seizure describing 76 of them same January we also presented in our annual League against epilepsy our current numbers in the treating with medical cannabis oil and vaporization let me first emphasize once again that this is in effect an observational study patients were in our tertiary epilepsy referral centers for 12 months prior to being enlisted part of being included in the study we used Mike mentioned an enriched CBD 1 to 20 ratio controlling was done by two independent labs one is a university lab and the other a GMP approved that collection of data was done at visits or phone visits to be included went ahead of course refractory epilepsy with at least five to seven antiepileptic drugs being used before or ketogenic diet or venous mall surgery patients were treated for consecutive three months before being actually included the age range we aim for an age range of 1 to 18 the - sign is because actually in Israel we don't have such a good transition epilepsy units for the for the elderly above 18 so many of our patients actually we do see them later on when they're in their 20s and even after that the exclusion criteria right in front of you or a severe behavioral disorder if there was any significant family history of psychiatric background or congestive heart failure we try to refrain as much as we could from dosage adjust adjustments than the first part of the trial that is at least we had 100 I'm sorry yes we had 130 patients with refractory epilepsy and as you can see it is quite clear that about many of them have used many many drugs before being enlisted in the in the in the study the age range in actual fact was between one year and thirty two years but you see that the vast majority of far of our study were under 15 years of age another figure which is quite quite impressive is the fact that above 90% of our of our study population has were intellectually disabled this is quite clear when one looks at the theology related making epileptic and calf allopathy the far largest epileptic and calf allopathy as the definition by the International League against epilepsy the ILA is a heterogeneous group of epilepsy syndromes associated with severe cognitive and behavioral disturbances these disorders vary in their age of onset development outcome the geology's neuropsychological deficits EEG patterns seizure types and prognosis but all may have a significant impact on neurological development again you see the theologies and if we can further delineate them then you see that the acquired group consisted of Tito mega Novara CMV herpes simplex virus FAR's which were elaborate in a few minutes the genetic epileptic and capella potties consisted of dravet syndrome the CBL v tuberous sclerosis for instance also of note are the brain malformations such as a genesis of corpus callosum or cortical dysplasia the hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy consisting about a fifth of our patients but you see that there are quite a few that we don't have any theologies for this is a good time to present to you a few of our patients the first being or we are in the middle they live in the south of Israel in a lab this is oh we are there's a 12 year old girl she has my chronic and the falafels Apothic epilepsy she's currently being treated for antiepileptic drugs and VNS in the past time she's uh she used to be treated with ketogenic diets and she all in all she had at least thirteen antiepileptic and antiepileptic medications medical cannabis improved her continuous micronus she had this these jerks these jerks in her fingers all the time and in her in her upper extreme upper extremities in a patron these this my clonus responded in the past four to valproic acid which gave us the notion that it it must have been epileptic origin it is quite difficult to perform recurrent EGS to patients and in that condition so sometimes we do rely on the on the clinical outcome when the parents were confronted they actually said that this was a major this was a major improvement in their quality of life in past times used to have these continuous nighttime unease due to this micronus which stopped completely after the use of medical oil this is Yuval this pleasant young fellow he's 11 years old at 7 years he had fires which I said earlier fires is the febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome which was the presentation he had super refractory status epilepticus meaning that he was seizing all the time for he was hospitalized at the pediatric intensive care unit for about three weeks with pursuing with intractable epilepsy which left him with severe cognitive deterioration he was seven years old and he actually functioned like three and a half or four years old after this this hospitalization after medical cannabis oil initiation he had decreased decreased number of antiepileptic drugs and substantially in lower the seizure burden the seizure number the mildest seizures shorter seizure and a very impressive cognitive improvement Tahlia is the one of the youngest I think if not the youngest of our patients she's now 16 months old she's was presented the two months with epileptic and calf allopathy later on we discovered through exome sequencing that what this is due to a genetic cause she has a unique de novo mutation in the allegation eukaryotic elongation factor 182 there are only 13 other known people who that mutation throughout the world and she's the youngest of them all and by far she has the worst presentation and ongoing epilepsy the other people with this kind of mutation or similar mutation have are doing less worse than her medical cannabis which was really the parents really pushed us into giving her medical cannabis and they were right improved her my clonic seizures and general alertness of course she still has seizures but the the effect it had on her everyday life and the her family everyday life was was really astonishing so taking us back to the results of our study the CBD dose range was between five to thirty milligrams per kilogram per day the seizure frequency reduction you can see that about thirty two percent of our study population had a 50% and more seizure reduction relating to adverse effects actually we don't have results that differ from those that were presented before me somnolence decreased appetite aggressiveness fatigue increased appetite also by few restlessness there were no systemic systemic allergies the dropout rate was about a third of the of the whole of the study and this was due either to aggravation of seizures or to no effect whatsoever or to some adverse effects that were evident it is very important for me to stress out some important adverse effect that we did encounter much has been said about the cannabis being safe I have to these two slides well I think enlightening this issue in a little different way tea is 1/10 23 year old female with dravet syndrome at initiation of medical cannabis she was treated with two antiepileptic medications one of them a benzodiazepine initiation of the of the cannabis oil caused severe and immediate seizures of new semiology 2 to extent that we had to stop the the medical cannabis and immediately she she stopped seizing the way she did the second patient has an annex the store you see is also one of the senior patients is 21 years old he has intractable epilepsy with cognitive impairment and autism hmm he's been Nam on VN s for a couple of years ketogenic diet in the past he has still v NS and three antiepileptic medications and medical cannabis oil initially he had quite an improvement with the medical cannabis with the seizure burden and with his alertness even started playing the guitar something which his parents were really impressed by but then after he received the pure CBD he developed a catatonic state meaning that he had this muscular rigidity and a stupor estate we had to to treat him with excess benzodiazepines in this case and gradually but quite quickly actually over two weeks that was gradually we we stopped the medical cannabis and he returned to himself positive phenomena you've seen it before increased alertness improved behavior and attention sleep quality improvement the crease elevation improve pronunciation better motor skills decreased headaches and improved dystonia this is Val he's quite an interesting fellow he's 16 years old he has epilepsy and autism we don't know the etiology for his for his state his mother is is a herbalist and she's actually heading the Israeli group of parents of this forum of treatment of medical cannabis he has complex partial seizures and he has from time to time he has these clusters that are lasting for days at a time sometimes with secondary generalization after a medical cannabis or initiation he has he's been receiving the extract and vaporization the seizure burden decreased in intensity and better recovery from long seizures in his case it was the real quality of life changer does not miss school anymore there is no stuttering that used to be in the past after these cluster seizures he has improved handwriting and most of all important this is a 16 year old he used to sleep that his parents bedroom and by his own initiative he just transferred away from his parents bedroom to his own and he's persevering him for about half a year now this is an example of a physic and writing on the Left you see this hand it's in Hebrew you see his handwriting before cannabis initiation and on the right you see it's a special notebook again but you see that the handwriting improved and the letters are quite quite clear and he wrote especially for all of you in English my name is BA I live in Israel I'm 16 years old this is your tongue family a Jewish family from from America the father is heading the the cow industry the kibbutz where they live and the mother is a healer and you see him in the middle he's a very energetic fellow he's he's 23 or 24 years old with dravet syndrome currently he's been treated with two antiepileptic medications and after medical cannabis initiation vaporization all and the oil extract he absolutely has better seizure control and better quality of life for him and his family I will say a few words about the second study that we conducted a study within a study and again this was mainly because of parental let's say pressure or initiation and we try to do at least to harness a little bit the the treatment of the vaporization for medical reasons this is a preliminary description of the pediatric patients being treated with vaporization it's as either the stationary vaporizers or the mobile devices which are all familiar with and their examples are or set here is outside again it's between our three medical centers all you know we had 24 patients that were using were being treated with vaporization these are 24 patients out of the 130 and 30 to begin with the inclusion criteria to be to be treated with vaporization was no response to medical cannabis oil extract target dose being initially it was 10 milligrams per kilogram later on we raised it as we went along to 15 milligrams per kilogram today or 300 all in all milligrams daily either that or tolerance that medical cannabis oil target dose cluster seizures exceptionally intense seizure burden compared to baseline or low compliance to medical cannabis oil extract meaning the patients then were not able to swallow these um these oil drops the exclusion criteria by respiratory disease the vaporizers cause many times and irritative cough which lasts for hours and this was an exclusion criteria hypersensitivity reaction to the oil which like I previously mentioned we hadn't a count encountered any reactions a cardiovascular disease family history of mental illness and of special considerations here were any kind of drag interactions listed below we had 24 patients which is about a fifth of our primary cohort there were 16 males and eight females most were above ten years old these were the seniors the seniors of our population and you see here the age range between three years and thirty two years with an average age of nearly of twelve and a half years a median of thirteen contradictory to our primary cohort you see here that there are the intellectual disability ratio is a little bit slower there are more alert kids perhaps because of the cooperation needed 23 patients were treated simultaneously of what the oil extract I know I said this was a preliminary requisite but two patients later on stopped being on medical cannabis oil the average treatment time was 13 months like I said and the total daily dose was about nearing 350 milligrams daily you have the range there you have two ranges that is because one of the patients was extremely obese so excluding him you see a different range in the in the lower brackets the average daily CBD dosage was 30 milligrams per kilogram today within the range that we really wanted I hope this is clear enough you can see the age distribution with a large part a large proportion being above 10 years of age the response to vaporization there were about two that respondent tremendously well that's in the bluish upper corner at the lower side the five are those who responded to short clusters a mild response was experienced by eight low compliance were two as I mentioned before and no responders were seven by t ology the response by etiology you can see that there is some kind of effect to the genetic epileptic and cephalopod ease with at least in aura in our small cohort no effect whatsoever to those patients suffering from congenital brain malformations I will begin with the conclusions about the vaporization and then continue to go to the whole of them of our study vaporization appears to be a promising and effective method of delivering medical cannabis oil for medical cannabis or for the treatment of intractable epilepsy in the pediatric population especially the treatment of cluster seizures in to a certain extent epileptic and careful aunty's the per ization appears to be unhelpful in congenital brain malformations shortening of cluster seizures and seizure intensity are considered and especially by the by the patient spent with patients families a quality of life changer a major quality of life changer there is need for standard standardization of the vaporization devices and delivery methods and substances to be delivered for instance we began with heating to 230 degrees later on moving to 210 and the current heating is 190 this is to avoid the paralytic substances for future times and present of course do we need to to recommend using the mobile vaporizers or the stationary vaporizers which is better and moving on to our main study conclusions medical cannabis oil minute medical cannabis in general has a substantial effect on seizures especially it seems on genetic epilepsies administration has to be delivered by a caring physician I think the examples shown about the safety and about the adverse effects there are the true life-threatening adverse effects that we sometime encounter not always but sometimes do necessitate a physician on board the initial target dose is between 10 and 15 I would say milligrams kilograms per day but as mentioned yesterday there is individual dosing up titration we we really see some effect with 1 to 2 milligrams per day and other times we see the effect only with high doses we see better efficacy when given the medical cannabis oil three times a day but in some instances we do give them twice a day especially with children that go to the special care centers two kindergartens where sometimes the people in charge are reluctant to give the medical cannabis oil so it can be done we do continue the anti epileptic drugs we don't we don't even if we encounter a quick response due to the honeymoon period we do not stop the anti epileptic medication because this could be harmful we do that gradually over time over the visits I mentioned before for medications that we know that have drug interactions now probably more than that absolutely there are more than that and we need the collaboration and the data to support that concomitant ketogenic diet or steroid therapy we have to use with caution if we want to initiate that during the demand they initiate after the initiation of medical cannabis or treating at both times because of the side effects either hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to either ketogenic diet initiation or after being given steroids you encounter hyperglycemia there are relatively few adverse events they are not dose related and about the safety I think I've said a couple of words the positive effects were were quite overwhelming the increased alertness the behavioral change the better attention span the better communication encountered then again a word of coach of caution we used to need to be especially care with patients of psychiatric background that is it doesn't mean we cannot treat them a few of those patients that have been in our cohort do did receive at some time or another did receive some medication later on for behavioral purposes as a requisites of of them participating in everyday activities and we should also consider administration of cannabis oil and cannabis vaporization to patients who have normal cognitive function I think that the results about the adverse effects and and the positive phenomena do do call for that our study limitations we didn't have a control group some dosage adjustment inconsistencies were where these are three medical centers there are about we were about five to six physicians that were treating these patients and different approaches to the to the medical field and different experiences have been sometimes do affect that those those dosage and inconsistencies our overall results are relying on parental impression so when we say that there is an improvement in the seizure burden we are actually in fact relying on what the parents tell us now you have to know that these are parents as many of you here know these are parents that are on a daily basis are living those seizures and for them to write down every seizure and every movement it's impossible so we have to think of some some good device or tool to measure that we cannot put these patients on video EEG all the time there are some tools which are extensive but we need to construct I think globally here at once again to construct some guidelines to how do we measure these these seizures in the correct way about the long-term effects let me just quote professor mu shu l'm giving his he gave the keynote lecture on the israeli league against the epilepsy last january he said that the long-term effects of cannabinoids especially THC to the developing brain are a main point of concern due to lack of enough relevant data in the medical professional literature thank you and I think this is something we should all bear in mind although we did not exceed initially the THC level of one milligrams later on in the study with the elder ones we did exceed we did reach one point three and one point five milligrams daily dosage of THC this is a true a matter of concern and just lately excuse me for not remembering the the author just recently in the past month was an article about the maternal delivery through the placenta and to do through breast milk of THC affecting the the fetus and the developing child so this is a true matter of concern future requirements we cannot avoid the randomized control trials we need to have some more uniformity within us uniformity of the of the medical cannabis oil that we're using we need to have sometimes better supply better lab facilities that we know like in with medication if we want to treat it as medication we have to examine it as a medication being GMP approved we need to know that the dose that we are giving is the exact dose we need a proper seizure follow-up we need to do regular blood examinations of the effect that the medic that the medical cannabis has on the liver function tests we need the regular eg follow-up although it is difficult like I described to you and you know very well we need the EEG follow-up this is extremely important we need to learn about the drug interactions and we need to conduct a cognitive assessment in the beginning of the trial throughout the trial and after the trials to know exactly how do we have this effect and we need to measure the quality of life in better tools which is again it's extremely difficult to measure the quality of life with someone you cannot converse a to but you do have the parental impression which is important it was thrust out before me but I will put my my word in its for again there is a need for the accompanying nurse for especially for parental guidance and support I cannot underestimate how much this is important this day and age we have the the social media the patients consult us 24/7 and that's less but there is no substitute for the personal touch and there is no substitute for meeting the patients the patients families and explaining once and once and once and again how to deliver the medical cannabis oil or the vaporization and to correct things that are need to be corrected and to give the proper guidance I thank you very much for listening I had a glimpse of Australia here for just a couple of days and I loved it very much you have a beautiful country and I really thank you for this invitation thank you very much
vqE_aFN2pLI,Are studies still needed on medical benefits of marijuana?,2016-06-14T18:18:11Z,well this is the law right here how look how thick this is there's so many particulars about this law and a lot of questions which newly created marijuana Control Commission will have to address as it relates to this for example because marijuana is still illegal under federal law most banks won't even touch the money which turns marijuana into a cash business that then raises all sorts of security issues and the new law leaves doctors and patients with questions as well local twelves lisbonne is talked to a local expert about what it could mean to those who are suffering Liz good afternoon guys had a great conversation today with the CEO of ohc they care for hundreds of cancer patients in our community he says legalization of medical marijuana brings up a lot of new questions which patients and healthcare providers will have to consider these patients I talked to today all know what it's like to have cancer or have a loved one suffering from it many say they would support at least having the option of medical marijuana for at least some of what advocates say it might help appetite stimulation and pain control but dr. Randi brune says simply offering this medications to patients who may benefit not so simple and it's primarily difficult because the legalization if you will of medical marijuana is way ahead of the science of using marijuana or marijuana extracts to actually treat diseases dr. brune says there are studies which show that at least some of the ingredients in marijuana may help certain conditions such as seizures but that's all we know it's being touted for autoimmune diseases and cancer pain and muscle spasms and a whole variety of things unfortunately there's no science behind any of this at this point in time now are there certain patients that are going to benefit more from a medical marijuana approach to a given problem maybe probably but we don't know because that study hasn't been done we just don't know the answer to the question one of the concerns that dr. Byrne expressed is that dosing for each medical concern hasn't even been established legalization of something is different than established medical benefit with FDA approval each practice will have to establish guidelines he says about how it can be safely used as this new research becomes available interesting stuff Thank You Liz and if you do have symptoms of pain and nausea it's also important to tell your doctor and ask about current medications on the market
XYqXE2z29dM,Andrew Katelaris on AusCann,2016-01-17T23:31:59Z,well they might be growing I mean eventually they'll grow but so what you know that's just a tightly controlled little federal thing it's so what what's it going to change yeah I know them what are they now some retired politician and another banker right running the show so ok good on them they have got you know that'll do some good we're not out to criticize and tear other people down but if they think that's the answer to medical cannabis they're a long way away the answer for medical cannabis in my mind is when everyone who needs cannabis has it provided at an affordable cost and aa scam is not going to be able to do that
HuN-zmHeS3c,Dr Bonni Goldstein MD,2016-06-10T18:59:02Z,"from the USA now I have the pleasure of introducing dr. Bonnie goldstein with a talk titled medical cannabis treatment for adults and children dr. Bonnie goldstein is a native of New Jersey after attaining her education she was a clinical instructor for asari in pediatrics at USC School of Medicine in Los Angeles emergency transport attending physician at Children's Hospital Los Angeles and emergency medicine attending physician in the pediatric emergency department at Los Angeles County USC Medical Center in 2008 dr. Goldstein developed an interest in the science of medical cannabis after witnessing its beneficial effects in an ill friend since then she's evaluated thousands of patients the use of medical cannabis with a focus and an entry an interest in treating pediatric epilepsy autism and cancer dr. Goldstein has given numerous lectures as a patient support programs and doctor Golson is the owner and medical director of Kenna centers a medical practice devoted to educating patients about the use of cannabis for serious and chronic medical conditions and the medical director for weed maps comm she is a member for the International Association of cannabis as medicine the International cannabinoid Research Society and the Society of cannabis clinicians ladies and gentlemen gives me great pleasure to introduce dr. Bonnie goldstein all right thank you so much for inviting me lucy and united in compassion it's really very exciting to come all the way to Australia to share my information and to hopefully help people understand that medical cannabis is a medicine I kind of get from the feeling of today that I'm preaching to the choir a little bit but anybody who's had any doubts you must believe that we're not all crazy that this is medicine it was medicine for a very long time and only for a short time over the last few thousand years it was it was turned into a drug of abuse and that's where the mistake was made and now we're spending all his time energy money effort trying to turn that mistake around propaganda is not the way to go fear is certainly not the way to go education is the way to go and before I get started I want to say I am the mother of a 15 year old boy I've been in medical practice for a medical physician for 25 years and I've learned that education as Rob said is the only way that we can move this forward we must educate ourselves and then we must educate others we cannot use fear tactics and we cannot treat this as a drug of abuse all drugs can be abused when I worked in the pediatric emergency emergency department I saw all kinds of things being abused by teenagers teenagers makes stupid decisions that's what they do and we have to allow that but if I had to pick one thing for my child to a beat quote abuse it would certainly be cannabis and because I know he would never end up in an ER and I wouldn't have to worry about claiming his body at the morgue I saw so many teenagers come in intoxicated with alcohol and prescription drugs that I started dreading Friday night shifts because I knew that I was gonna have to call parent and say sorry we have your child in the ICU because they went to a party and they're not coming home tonight and hopefully they're gonna wake up tomorrow so this is not cannabis just has to be we have to stop looking at it as a narcotic we have to stop looking at it as a drug of abuse it is medicine this is my favorite slide of all and I woke up one day to this text message this is Isaiah he's one of my patients and his mother decided to take a piece of cardboard and put a note on it and post it on Facebook and send it to me as well and it says hi my name is Isaiah I'm 8 years old I have intractable epilepsy no pharmaceutical has ever stopped my seizures ever I was having seizures every 30 to 45 seconds today February 2nd of this year 2016 I am one month pharmaceutical free and six months seizure free big thanks to God realm of caring Miriam's Hope dr. G hashtag cannabis as medicine hashtag seizure saw cannabis oil gave me life but gave me back my son what's interesting about Isaiah is Isaiah has an aunt and an uncle who both have intractable seizure disorders his uncle is severely mentally handicapped from the seizures never be in control his mother saw Isaiah's future and she refused to accept that and now I can just happily say Isaiah has three more months added on to pharmaceutical free and seizure free and he's in school he's succeeding he's doing well he's learning and there's no reason to make one more child wait for an opportunity it may not be the option and it's not like it turns around in one day there it's a process when you're using cannabis but it absolutely 100% needs to be an option and it really should be an option now so in my practice I take care of both adults and children and as you can see the most common diagnoses we see with adults really it's almost everything yes dr. hager rather said we see so many different things that remember that's because where the receptors are located it affects just about every physiologic system in your body no question that chronic pain is the number one thing that we're seeing in my along with sleep disorders psychiatric illness and so on where I live and practice which is in Los Angeles it's a little different than Northern California Southern California still has a lot of issues with acceptance and it's surprising it's the same state but there's really if you've ever been there or you know anybody from there they'll tell you Northern California and Southern California really should be different states the way they act but in general the words out and cannabis is a real option for patients who have any of these conditions and so many people are finding that it really works quite well now for my pediatric patients it is somewhat limited to these disorders treatment-resistant epilepsy autism advanced cancer I have a handful of patients with psychiatric disorders and then I'm also seen something new in my practice just in the last few months I've had three patients come in with pans or pandas which is a type of pediatric autoimmune disease and what's interesting about this particular condition is that it was it's not really fully defined and it's just becoming something that is new newly diagnosed and so we're at least doctors are newly diagnosing it and I suspect that we're going to see more patients who have pandas a lot of the science has already been discussed and so I'm going to try to limit this to really the clinical aspects for the most part and remember with cannabis treatment we're talking about over 400 compounds in the cannabis plant versus single molecule pharmaceuticals so it's going to work differently it is a different type of medicine the main compounds vitam cannabinoids there's over a hundred that have been described when we know the focus is on research has been mostly THC and CBD but certainly all the other cannabinoids we're going to see in more and more strains available with higher amounts of the contaminoids as well terpenoids which have been discussed basically the essential oils that have medicinal properties entourage effect and synergy we've discussed that already but it's certainly the reason that I encourage patients to use full spectrum plan as opposed to single molecule plant compounds excellent safety profile no fatalities again and I worked in pediatric emergency medicine for about 13 years in busy inner-city Los Angeles with 60,000 pediatric emergency room visits and I did not see one cannabis patients problem in in all of that time what's interesting about cannabis is I often get asked what strain do you recommend for instance for Parkinson's disease what strain do you recommend for a DD and it really depends on the patient's overall condition I asked lots of questions when I meet with patients because I'm trying to get a sense of what the patient is looking for and really what the problems are because remember you can have two patients with fibromyalgia sure that you know you check off the same box but they may have very different problems one patient says well my fibromyalgia is not really causing me that much trouble because I've been sleeping okay because I figured out how to do that but I have pain issues and then we have the exact opposite so really you want to find an individual approach and part of that too is because the response is individual I can I have patients with the same diagnosis who respond very differently to the same dose the same strain the same ratio CBD to THC so part of this is that it is not one-size-fits-all and we really can't assume that in general with cannabis we jokingly say start low and go slow but really what that means is you start low dose and you titrate up again everybody's dose is different and I believe it was dr. Abrams from UCSF who who coined the term patience determined self titrating dose now that's a little bit different for epilepsy and also for some some of my cancer patients but in general patients get to decide you can find a dose that will work for you a strain that will work for you will be very individual as I said someone with the same condition same diagnosis may have a very different response to your result now the endocannabinoid system has been discussed and so I don't want to go over it too much but again the big key here is your endocannabinoid tone as dr. Russo talked about is individual to you I like to explain this to my patients in a way that really they can understand it remember you have a certain spot where your endocannabinoid system lives and if you are under or over it can lead to illness and it's usually for many an endocannabinoid deficiency I liken that to thyroid a thyroid condition if you have low thyroid what does your doctor replace it with thyroid math medication right so if you meet somebody or you yourself have disease and you have not found the answer for it it's certainly possible and when we look at the list of conditions that are considered possible into cannabinoid deficient conditions you're not if you're not using endocannabinoid you're treating all around it and you're missing the target so we have to remember that you can look at the person next to you I may not look ill but they may have very well have an endocannabinoid deficiency and that may be on a skill some people may be slow look just a slight amount and other people may be more I have a lot of patients who use cannabis and they do not really get high from a certain amount of THC they have likely found their sweet spot where their endocannabinoid deficiency is actually now they're not deficient anymore they're out of balance and it's working beautifully for that the same goes for you might make you to stone or might not do anything everybody is individual in this now medical cannabis patients for adults on my patients come in they have to fill out a form that details their history what they've tried whether or not they use cannabis before I do find it's a little bit different between patients what we call cannabis naive never used cannabis ever ever or patients who are experienced and then there's some people in there who say well you know I smoked it back in the day in the 60s or 70s and I haven't touched it since once I have an idea of how they're approaching cannabis and whether or not and I also say to patients well when you did smoke it back in the day what did you find oh I used to sleep great or oh I hated it it'd make me anxious that gives me some idea of where to go with their treatment because if they're telling me that they're anxious from it it's quite possible that they just overdid it in a recreational setting but it's also possible that they don't do very well with high doses or high amounts of THC method of delivery as dr. Hartman Ravel went over is very important I ask patients what sounds good to you it may not be where we end up you may say to me I'm absolutely not going to inhale it I only want to eat it but when you eat it you may find it's just too strong you can't dial in the dose and then you may want to switch over to inhaling it I have some patients that have come in who have cancer there are very very strong chemotherapy so in fact I just recently had a patient came in and she had a little baggie and she opened it up and dumped it on my desk and it was all of these edible products that someone had given her out of compassion and she said none of it works well she's likely not absorbing any of it the chemotherapy was destroying her gut she had lost about 50 pounds she wasn't able to really eat anything and I just don't think she had any absorption that is not the way for this particular patient to use cannabis so delivery method you must have options people have to have different ways to take it that will work again best for them in my practice a majority of patients are using either inhalation smoking vaporizing or sublingual take tinctures that have become readily available and then a small percentage of patients do find edibles to help again edible because of the effect through the liver can be very difficult to dose although some patients do figure out dosing effects of CBD and THC it's important to know what the effects of CBD and what the effects of THC and that's already been discussed today but again I find for most of my patients some combination thereof is very helpful in California there are so many products available now that if you really don't have an idea of what you're doing it is completely and totally intimidating it's like walking into the Vitamin Shoppe and seeing that big wall of vitamins and saying oh no I don't know what to get and you turn around and walk out without anything so what I've done is I kind of came up with this three-tiered approach to patients to explain to them three different ways that cannabis are available in California and hopefully that would be something that would be available here and this way you're going in with an approach of what sounds you know a patient can say what sounds good to them where they want to start of course being flexible to ship between these three different categories may be required in order to find the answer so of course th to THC rich medicine that's the medicine that we you know most people have tried in a recreational setting the THC is the dominant effect and I we say it's not only recreational I really bothers me when people say THD is recreational only absolutely not I've been doing this for a long time and for the first five years of my practice CBD products were very very rare to find most of my patients who are getting good results were getting good results with THC they just were responsible adult users and patients the medical dose can be found if you take too much okay back up you don't have to stay there it's very simple you titrate up you may say oh I overdid it and you back right back down to find that dose that works for you for most of my patients they're using THC rich medicine at nighttime because they want to have a functional day although there are many patients who do use it during the daytime as well my my caveat is just do us everybody a favor don't drive if you're feeling that you the psychoactive effects be responsible like you live with any other medication that has psycho activity most of my patients using THC rich medicine this is just you know some of the things sleep pain nausea mood and appetite those are the things that some patients say where THC rich medicine works the best form and then what I've done for my patients is I've broken down a high ratio CBD to THC and low ratio CBD to THC so that they can understand that with the lower ratio there is a combination of effects and with the higher ratio there's still combination but it's more of a CBD dominance and what that allows for is for a patient to use something that maybe not all THC low CBD but something the opposite way that allows them to still get arranged from two let's say twenty seven to one is about the highest we see on the market in California all the way down to ten and one ten to one you are still getting dominant CBD effects but getting some THC effects as well but you're really limiting the psycho activity for most patients again it's individual but for most of my patients anything over and to one they just don't feel the high effects and for many of them it's not sedating and there allows them to use use it during the daytime to control symptoms and also to still be functional for many patients it's for pain inflammation mood and certainly seizure disorders the lower ratio CBD to THC again it's a combination effect it may or may not be psychoactive it depends on who you are it depends on if you have some tolerance to THC it depends on if you're brand new to this it also depends on how your brain responds CBD will buffer some of the THC effects and less than some of the psycho activity so again depending on your response that may work better for you pain inflammation mood sleep nausea certainly neuropathic pain appears to be in this category in terms of treating pain very effectively the reason again why I did this kind of breakdown is so that patients can approach products that are labeled and tested and understand the effects that they might get from now now here's a case report of one of my patients of 54 year old female with diabetic neuropathy this is one she's one of my favorite patients she comes to see me a couple times a year she is a middle school counselor and so she's very very private about her cannabis use she's had to eat your history of adult onset diabetes with six years of nerve pain interfering with sleep and she underwent a gastric bypass so that she could she was morbidly obese when I met her and now she's actually quite thin and she had significant weight loss which resulted in the control of her glucose but her neuropathy persisted and that's how she ended up in my office she's tried multiple different drugs including gabapentin and opiates and nothing seemed to work at all someone in her life gave her some cannabis before she came to my office and she found complete relief of pain and much improved sleep and so she wanted to be legal she didn't want to risk her job or her situation and so we started her and I believe by the way that the product that she was using when she came in it was just a cookie that someone had given her so she wasn't really sure but she told me that it made her a little buzzed and put her to sleep so he's pretty sure it was a high THC product but during the daytime she if she had pain she would use or she is using CBD to THC draw us for in a spray and the ratio she's using is about a twenty five to one and then she would also buy topical cannabis to her feet if they were bothering her and she actually found that to be really take the edge off the pain so she wasn't so focused on the pain and she was able to think about her job again if she's having a good day in her pain she doesn't have pain that day she skips it she doesn't need to take it that day and nighttime she was had decided to add in after I taught her about CBD which she had not heard of she decided to try a low ratio CBD to THC edible and it's a one to one ratio she takes it about eight or nine o'clock at night and she says that she gets about between six and eight hours of undisturbed sleep and her feet don't hurt in the morning when she wakes up and she's really found that has worked very well she is not required she doesn't require medicine every night she says there are some weeks that are good some weeks that are bad and she just uses as needed but the important thing is she's gotten off all other pain and sleep medications that were prescribed to her and now she's just doing diet controlled so she's actually pharmaceutical free here's another case report of a patient again one of my favorite patients the 26-year old gal that came in and she had onset of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis at the age of 15 and so I saw her at first the age of 24 she had tremendous side effects with conventional medications and actually what brought her into my office was she had a life-threatening allergic reaction to one of the medications where she ended up in the ICU and the family was told that she actually might not get out of the ICU and so at that point they withdrew all medic once she survived they was through all medications and they came to me but I will tell you she is wheelchair-bound when I met her she was very anxious and depressed she has severe disability due to the pain and swelling she was unable to go to school or take care of herself and the really sad thing for her is she has three she's the eldest sister of four sisters and the other three are going to college have boyfriends have independent lives or driving and so on and she was really the one that was kind of at home and I think it just really caused a lot of anxiety and depression for her and when I first saw her she was anti cannabis she was open to it after having so many people talked to her about it but what we've done is we put her on very high dose high ratio CBD to THC oil she takes a ratio of about twenty seven to one she's taking upwards of 200 milligrams of CBD per day it's divided in every eight-hour doses and it's worked tremendous for her I mean she is her she has the hands of like a seven-year-old they're completely contracted and swollen and deformed and she texted me one day to tell me that she knew she was getting better when she was able to clip her own fingernails with the fingernail clipper because she could actually use the device now she does also use inhaled and sublingual THC rich cannabis for breakthrough pain through mostly vaporizer and that's just recently switched to sublingual and she's not taking any other medications she and I email and text here and there and I just had to steal her quote from a recent email for so long I couldn't do anything I'm living again the medicine that I prayed for but didn't know existed finding cannabis was an answer to those prayers and that's kind of amazing for her she feels that she's gotten her life back she started cooking she's able to take a shower by herself and these are all tremendous things for someone who has such severe disability and then this is a very common story that I see this is a 47 year old construction worker he's the dad of two children he had a very severe injury at work where a very large piece of furniture that they were trying to take up some stairs fell on him and he subsequently was diagnosed with the herniated lumbar disc and he went through the typical conventional treatment opiates muscle relaxers nonsteroidals physical therapy and epidural injections and he really did not get any relief and he was reluctant to have surgery so he and he's funny because he comes from a family of cops of policemen and so he was very reluctant to come in and it had a lot of questions but he started using THC which cannabis before coming in and he found relief and he basically came in and said I just want to be legal I'm a law-abiding citizen I just want to continue to be law-abiding and so we did try CBD with him he didn't find it to be effective for daytime use and so he's really just using canvas at night THC rich cannabis mostly he says that if he's overdone it at work and he feels something flaring up with with my encouragement he started adding some CBD at nighttime and it appears that he doesn't get these full-blown kind of episodes where he can't get out of bed he's able to kind of reduce the the flare up when he adds in CBD he's also been using exercise in acupuncture and he's also a patient of mine who's been able to stay off all medications at this point as well now moving on to pediatric use people often ask me how do you prescribe or how do you recommend cannabis to children these are not healthy children that are coming in to see me healthy children are at school and running around and doing wonderful things the patients that are coming in to me are usually patients that have of course tried many other things but there's scientific evidence now we know especially with seizure disorder and starting to see some evidence in the literature for autism that there is endocannabinoid system dysfunction again if that's where the dysfunction is that's what we should be treating again cannabis has an excellent safety profile in my pediatric patients I see little to no side effects we have to remember quality of life for these families even any little improvement is going to be better than where they are today if they can get some improvement with cannabis it may not be perfect but it again without side effects this is something that families have to have an option for certainly compassionate care and end-of-life for patients that are terminal and then more recently in California there is much better testing of products there's way more products on the market and by the way you know in California we kind of did it backwards people voters voted this in and then it was available many doctors resisted and then some doctors became pioneers in this and then certainly more doctors now are recommending it or at least recommending patients to go see a doctor who will recommend it but we didn't have tested products for the most part and so you really didn't know what you were getting and in general it was still very safe if something didn't work you could go back and try something else but we have regulations coming into effect in about a year and a half finally that's 22 years after the law was passed it's about time but now what I tell patients is fight like buy products that are labeled know what you're getting there's no reason to buy anything that's not label because for the most part we can actually see now that there's no pesticides no solvents whether it was grown indoors or outdoors with the potency is in terms of the THC and CBD and so that is certainly enhanced my assurance that my pediatric patients are going to get products that are not going to be potentially bad for them now I'm just going to go over the CBD use in epilepsy because there's certainly a lot of interest and a lot of media attention to this the literature back in the late 70s and in the 80s there were three small trials and there were some results that that show that this was helpful it wasn't for everybody that was that was in these small groups however what was definitely found out was that CBD was very well tolerated that there were little to no side effects and that it certainly had some promise and what's interesting is if you look the last one there is 1985 in Neverland again until 2005 which is a tremendous long time without any movement forward this was presented at the 2005 Congress on cannabis and cannabinoids in the Netherlands in 2005 and there was an open study of 18 pediatric patients with refractory seizure disorders they found no side effects requiring CBD discontinuation the majority saw at least a 25% improvement in seizures with low CBD doses and all the CVD treated children had improvement in consciousness and if they had spasticity that was improved as well this is a report in epilepsy and behavior in 2013 to Stanford doctors surveyed 19 patients using CBD rich cannabis this was the oil that was promoted or put on the map by dr. Sanjay Gupta CNN special called weed and these families were using the Charlotte's Web strain that became very famous in California as you can see thirteen of the children had Gervase syndrome which if you're not familiar with that it's a genetic seizure disorder that has a very poor prognosis for had dusa syndrome and one hand lennox Gaston one child with idiopathic mean and unknown epilepsy the average number of anti epileptic drugs tried is 12 it's fairly well known in the neurology literature that only about 50% of patients respond to the first anti-seizure medicine and then the percentages drop after that only about 13% of patients respond to the second medicine then only somewhere between one and four percent has gone to the third medicine if you're trying 12 medicines you can be pretty sure you have a treatment resistant epilepsy or at least conventional treatment resistant epilepsy in their survey they found that 16 out of the 19 families reported a reduction in their child seizure frequency while taking CBD rich cannabis and you can see the breakdown there they had two kids become completely seizure free and remember these are kids who are treatment otherwise told intractable treatment-resistant eight out of the 19 reported greater than 80 percent reduction and six out of the 19 reported at 25 to 60 percent reduction what's interesting is that the beneficial side effects increased alertness better mood and better sleep and who wouldn't take that I have yet to hear that any anti anti epileptic medication has those beneficial effects and then at her side effects included drowsiness and fatigue another report that came out of Colorado by doctor Getty and dr. MA from Denver this was presented at the American Epilepsy Society meeting in 20 at the end of 2013 and it's only it's a small study but it it shows that 73% of the patients that took CBD oil had ninety eight to a hundred percent reduction of seizures and at three months 45% were seizure free those are excellent numbers I don't know if these patients were hand-picked for particular conditions I wasn't able to find that information now this is interesting as you know they think dr. Russo talked about at the dialects this is a compound that is being currently provided in the United States for try compassionate care trial and actually going into randomized trials right now and some of the initial information that has come out is actually quite helpful this is a report about CVD and drug interactions and it's important that we have some of this information because we do know CBD can be metabolized in the liver where many of these other drugs can be metabolized what this chart shows is so the axis all the way to the left is the percent change in serum levels the dark line that goes right through the middle is the base line meaning if we drew a drug level of one of the drugs listed at the bottom the base line would be at zero and then after CBD was added to the regimen another drug level was drawn and was charted either it went up or it went down of course without changing the dose of that particular drug so in the very first yellow line that you see up and down that's the drug called clove azam the brand name is on feet out of the 33 patients where they check levels pre and post CBD treatment as you can see the number 17 right above where it says cloves am there were 17 patients that were on cloves am and it's kind of confusing the one dark line on the higher top shows the average you can see that but in general you could see for some of these patients the club is m level was very was raised up after CBD was added the level went sky-high and they reported as high as four over 400% for one particular patient and for other patients it went down as low as almost 70 or 80% so some of the information that can be gleaned from this is if you'll see the fifth drug over that says lamotrigine primarily most of the levels have dropped there if you can see for FINA Bar primarily it's a little bit higher a good again the cocktail that patients are on medication cocktail that they're taking can be very can confuse all the variables but what's what we're starting to see is that we're starting to see that I know that when I add CBD to a child's regimen who is already on Aarthi I can tell the family on average Monty's going to go up keep an eye out for side effects because we don't normally check on thei levels but if I'm adding it to someone who's on lamictal I'm going to tell the family if you start seeing more seizures it's not the CBD causing the seizures I mean that is what we've added but it likely is causing that mikta level to go down and now your child main not CBD to cover because we start lowing and go up slowly from there so this information is very important here's another this is a survey actually out of UCLA and many of the patients that were in this survey you're also my patients because I get a lot of UCLA patients in my practice they surveyed a hundred and seventeen parents of children with epilepsy who had a minister and whole plant CBD this was not any specific products the patients were using probably one of about four or five different suppliers for the oil eighty five percent of families reported seizure reduction fourteen percent reported complete seizure freedom the average number of drugs that these children have been on prior to starting CBD was eight and again here are the side effects 53 percent improved sleep 71 percent and improved alertness 63 percent improve mood and what's interesting is they listed increased appetite as a bad side effect which for many families they'll tell you they're very happy that their child's actually showing interest another report out of epidural X and this is at the end of last year in 2015 they have their results for 261 patients who treatment resistant epilepsy and again what we're seeing is that CBD does appear to help control seizures for children over 47 percent in their trial had greater than 50% reduction of seizures remember epidural X has no THC in it and it has a very very small percentage of other cannabinoids it's a primarily CBD very different from what my patients who come to see me use but overall they saw nine percent seizure freedom and 13 percent in their drove a patient's which is fantastic and interestingly and this is why we'll take any information that's being done in trials is that what was found was cloven if the child was on close am they actually had an increased chance of getting seizure reduction so Clovis Amoco therapy was associated with the higher rate of treatment 57 percent versus 39 I used to tell you know people will come to me and tell me they hate club azam it makes their kids into zombies and I think part of that is because if you're not getting seizure control you're increasing the dose and you get to a point where now the child's on such a high dose that you're basically shutting that child down they're sleeping I have one family that told me they move their child from the bed to the couch to the stroller she never really did anything and she was on a very high dose of club azam and now that we've gotten it down she's actually woken up it didn't never really changed her the number of seizures she was having and she's had very good success novikova zoom and with CVD but we got it down to a dose where CBD and lobizon together seemed to work and was able to minimize the negative impact of those of that particular drug for her I have two patients uh two other patients that are children with seizures we leaned them off all drugs because they have a very good response but we're not seizure free once they were off everything they did have a slight rise in their seizures and we added back low-dose authy only in one case five milligrams and another child only two point five milligrams at night and they've had almost complete I'd say 99% cessation of seizure so sometimes you can use combination therapy for these children are very difficult epilepsy what's interesting about this study by the way and I really should point this out this was a side effect study in the United States to find out what are the side effects and they ramped the doses up and I should go back to this as you can see in the first bullet point they started at a low dose I think around 2 milligrams per kilo per day and they ramped it up to 25 milligrams per kilo per day and that is about twice as high as I go in my van in my family so the highest dose and part of that is because affordability but really the what they were looking for was side effects and these number the side effects listed here I mean I it's hard to say what a parent said to me but she said she would take explosive diarrhea all over her lap over another seizure because her child had said thousands and thousands and so when you see these side effects these are things that for most people make they can handle and remember these were on very high doses and may not be exactly what I just don't see these kind of side effects in which I'll get to in general they found it that if the daleks was overall tolerated well and that currently there as I mentioned there's some randomized controlled studies that are starting by the way if you see one of the bullet points says convulsions is the side effect in a patient already has commotions that's a little bit difficult and that was really there were multiple investigators in this and some reported increased seizures as a side effect and some did not so it's a little unclear as to whether or not it really does increase seizures or if it's just because it's messing with the child's other medications now how does CBD work as a anticonvulsant and so it's interesting THC remember works at the receptor site it is monogamous to that receptor site CBD has multiple sites of action it works in many different places as you can see here receptor independent channels it binds or blocks to non cannabinoid receptors modulating the flow of neurotransmitters it modulates calcium channels it will actually block the uptake of your natural endocannabinoid if a patient has a seizure disorder because they are endocannabinoid deficient but they may have some endocannabinoid potentially CBD can help enhance their own natural endocannabinoids to participate in maintaining a balanced system certainly anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective and antioxidant effects at work here as well so when CVD works remember it's not just at one place it's working on multiple levels and that may be why we are seeing so many benefits in especially in patients with epilepsy now THC is an anticonvulsant is interesting as dr. hergenrother mentioned it's been known to work I have a lot of adult patients that come in and they just want to be legal because they find cannabis is working you know they just take the puffs and they don't have any more seizures it's hard to know for sure that that's what's working for them but if they're not having seizures and that's what they attributed to and they're not having side effects I'm certainly on board with that there's conflicting results in animals it's been shown to be both an anticonvulsant an approach convulsant what's interesting for some is for some patients as they can develop tolerance and it may have some therefore limited use for patients with severe seizure disorders and if you're developing tolerance to the effects that you may not be able you know you can't just keep ramping up on it because eventually you're probably going to have some side effects from a very high dose certainly with a developing brain there's concerns for psychoactivity and for the developing brain but again as I mentioned earlier the patients who are coming to me who are children are very sick and we don't know what long term multiple anticonvulsants are doing to their brain I would put my bets on cannabis over any of those any day so I talked to the families about their negative perception of THC but I always tell them that maybe one of the things that we're going to use in order to control seizures clinically I found low doses of THC in a sublingual or sometimes through the g-tube or orally can be very helpful when weaning off other anticonvulsants remember if you're getting a good result once you start weaning you may have rebound seizures or withdrawal seizures and many of my families have found that they're using THC just for short-term for a few weeks after they wean a dose and they're able to get through that very difficult weaning period one of the products that I like that's available from multiple suppliers is 10 milligrams of THC per one ml this way when you you can measure very low doses because some children are highly sent to low doses you don't need a lot so on a little one ml syringe you can measure 0.1 ml it's about equal to four drops and that's about one milligram of this particular preparation so it allows us to really titrate to see if that's what's going to work for these patients it allows us to know exactly where that child how much they're getting and also to be able to repeat and not have to worry about what am I getting this month last month if it's ten milligrams in one ml or close to that we know that we can get very close consistency of medicine what I have found with some patients we have like a twenty seven to one or twenty five to one ratio that many patients start with either Charlotte's Web strain a CDC strain there are some others in California but those are the main two that most of my patients are using right now and I'll tell you just in the last two years we went from two suppliers to about eight supplier and they're all you know pesticide free tested solvent free there is a lot of CVD on the market that is still untested so you know regulations will help I'm going to go over what the requirements of a good product where a child is but in general now that there's eight different strains and products available to patients now have choices if something doesn't work they can try something else some of my patients again not only to get through the weaning off of anti-epileptics but in adding low dose THC to the CBD product that they're getting remember that changes the ratio and for some of those patients we get to a very nice spot I will tell you I'm a young man who had onset of seizures at the age of 10 and he had three years of terrible terrible uncontrollable seizures many drugs were tried he eventually went through testing to see if he was a candidate for brain surgery and he did have brain surgery and he had three days he's you're free after which the seizures came back with a vengeance he was having over 50 grand mal seizures a month and within one month of starting CBD rich medicine it went from 50 seizures down to six a month which was a huge improvement now he was able to go back to school but one of the interesting things post-surgery was that he developed this incredible rage and he's a big teenager and he just had the kind of rage where the parents were afraid of them so we added in THC and he's currently now using two products high THC and then a high CBD product when they're mixed in his what fits him is the ten ends up being a ten to one ratio the rage is gone his seizures are very well controlled and he's back in school and the family has some peace of mind and so having these products available to be able to mix a little bit to create what works for that individual may be the answer for some people if you try strain after strain after strain it may be that you one strain isn't going to do it you may need to mix them any name may need to mix high CBD with the high THC now other anticonvulsants and I put the reference at the bottom it's a very nice review paper CBD v has been investigated as an anticonvulsant and it appears to have an additive effect when out of the CBD in California for a period of time there was a product that was being claimed to have a large amount of CBD be compared to other strains and it turns out that it wasn't very much at all when it was tested but certainly this is something that unhooked and to see soon available to patients THCA which remember is the non psychoactive raw unheated THC precursor is not been readily available until the past year in California you can actually get a THC a oil that is measured out and we know that it works as a potent anti-inflammatory and then there's not very much research but anecdotally it's an anticonvulsant I have some patients who have done very well with CBD but not get full seizure controller when we add in THC a they have full seizure control I have some patients who didn't respond to CBD and we tried THC a and it worked and so now they're not on CBD but they're on th DEA and so again it's just another option for someone to try the next 3 cannabinoids have been looked at there's not a lot of studies on them but they've been reviewed and as you can see the cbn there's been conflicting results we've dealt - 8 th see there's some tolerance developed in the few studies that we're done and then th CV it appears to be effective but again it's not readily available so I'm not using it clinically now this is the results from my practice this is unpublished but what I did was I surveyed a lot of my patients at this point I've probably seen over 400 pediatric patients with treatment resistant epilepsy have come for help 201 patients responded when I asked was it luck as long as they were on at least three months trial of oil although the dosing change they weren't adding in other oils and they weren't switching from strangest dream they were staying consistent on one product the average number of medications that they had tried prior to coming in to see me was 12 with the range of two all the way up to 22 different anti-epileptics the average number of medications that they were on at the onset of adding CBD was 3 with a range of 0 and 7 excuse me I had a small percentage of patients that came in who were not on any Lenox and remember the common other issues with many of these patients is that they have global delay sometimes CP autism feeding difficulties cell growth delay post puberty behavioral issues so it's not just seizure disorder that we're treating as you can see the stranger which I've mentioned Charlotte's Web and ac/dc and these most common ratios and then in my practice what I saw was about 4% of patients actually did have worsening seizures it's hard to know if that was because of drug interaction click two out of the eight actually were not on medication of two other medications at the time and so those two particular patients it was hard to know exactly because CBD really shouldn't worsen their seizures but in those two patients it did about six of the patients had no response whatsoever no positive no negative now it's interesting it's about twenty eight patients about fourteen percent had no reduction a number of seizures but the parents reported that there was less severity and less duration and less duration so they just didn't last as long and remember oh excuse me when you're having a two minute seizure it feels like 20 minutes and so for a seizure to be reduced down to you know 14 seconds is thing that the parents can absolutely deal with they also saw at those patients they reported cognitive improvements so when you're seeing less severity less duration and some improvement in your child's alertness is beyond it the ability to interact with you they were very happy with those results and then I broke down the rest of the seizures as you can see 25 to 49 percent reduction about 18 percent had 50 to 74 percent reduction of seizures 37 percent had seventy five to ninety nine percent reduction of seizures and I had about a 13 percent seizure of freedom rate over 68 percent of patients had greater than 50 percent reduction of seizures of the 27 seizure free patients eight are now off medication and out of this group 40 percent were able to wean one or more medications the only negative side effects we saw with drowsiness or diarrhea and the positive side effects I mean the list is huge but these are the more common things that parents reported on the survey more alert better mood better sleep more energy better response to therapy from data type you can focus one mom rode able to argue which I thought was interesting because I guess her child prior was a little not learned enough to argue with her and what they argued about so cute is little girl never won she's on to go anywhere so mom was used to be able to just put them on her and they would go no you are visits or hospitalizations that one's big because that saves money and that also saves time away from your family and it's the number one thing a lot of the dads reported as beneficial because remember when moms in the hospital with the child who's at home taking care of the rest holding down the fort so to speak taking care of the rest of the family definitely left me for rescue medication and then I have two patients who also had type 1 diabetes who reported a more stable fucose when they added CBD to the regimen in my practice and again I've been seeing patients now for probably pediatric patients for the last three three years or so we start patients at one milligram per kilo per day I don't like starting at a high dose because the patients are the parents are paying through this out of pocket and for some patients low dose works there's no reason to start high and actually pacify the dose that actually might be effective sometimes they even start a little lower than not depending and I increased every couple of weeks as long as they're tolerating it well the parents check in with me every one to two weeks and the oils given either orally sublingual or through the g2 the average dose as you can see it's quite a range because everybody's different and everybody responds to a different dose but five to twelve milligrams per kilo per day is about where I see success if someone's not responding we can change strains we can change the CBD to THC ratio this is why multiple products should be available not just to products itself to consult for a company looking for a license in New York State there they're going to be five products available how the heck are we gonna help people when there's only five products available that's just not gonna work now it's interesting there appears to be no tolerance to CBD once you find the dose it seems to be the dose that works I do not seem to need much higher doses unless they're growing gaining weight or if there's some other variable to play here again we sometimes are weaning off other drugs we may go up on DVD but invariably we end up going back down there's a phenomenon that's been described as CVD saturation not in the scientific literature but kind of in the cannabis world it appears that sometimes if a patient has been on CBD at a higher dose or what's considered a high dose for that patient for quite some time anywhere six months nine months a year sometimes what will happen is the child will start seizing having more frequency of seizures and there's nothing else to blame it on nothing's been weaned the child's not sick nothing else has changed and sometimes been looking back on the history I'll see that the child has been on that particular dose for quite some time and it's interesting what we end up doing is we end up skipping a handful of doses anywhere from one to three days of doses and then when we start at a lower dose and those patients do great I've done this probably in about somewhere between 25 and 30 patients now and only one child didn't respond everybody else the seizures they went back to very few seizures and we were able to readjust the dose to the lower level I don't know why that happens you know some people describe that there's just you know they just don't need as much and maybe the fat is being saturated it's hard to know exactly what's going on there now for many patients I encourage them to have their drug levels checked to make sure especially if something's happening if they're having more seizures after we go up on dose or we get up to a higher dose I since I do not prescribe anti-epileptics I'm not a neurologist I'm helping patients with their cannabis I try to work in conduction in conjunction with the neurologist to have levels checked or encourage patients to get the levels check their neurologist THC oil is always an option as I mentioned earlier and then finding that CVG doesn't work also I forgot here we'll add in THC to help with with weaning and also sometimes just to lower the ratio which will work for some patients and then for in California cost is an issue I have patients spending as little as maybe 125 to 250 dollars a month and I have other families that are already at $750 a month or something like that so that's very hard to sustain out of pocket and you have other costs for children with special needs and so certainly it would be nice especially if someone you know you're getting a good response you're staying out of the hospital and getting off of drugs I really believe insurance should help pay for this now I'm thank you I see a fair amount of patients with autism and remember the main issues for these patients are communication repetitive behavior and really the big thing for many patients is social challenges the anxiety the Tantrums and this self injurious behavior and maybe even harm to others we know that the endocannabinoid system regulates emotional responses and anxiety behavioral social interaction immune system and all of these are aspects of autism there's only been a few preliminary studies and animals apparently we're showing some genetic mutations associated with autism that also are resulting in cement Oh cannabinoid dysfunction human study there was one thing one human study where as you know we don't want to take brain tissues dr. Russo said but you can draw white blood cell levels just draw blood on a child and they were able to check children with autism versus children who did not the children with autism have an abnormality in the number of receptors that they had on their white blood cells because that's where those receptors are expressed there are many anecdotal reports of children with autism responding to both CBD and THC and sometimes combination I survey 27 patients families of 27 patients with autism aged between 3 and 3 years in 18 years and these patients all started on high CBD to THC about 15 percent actually got more agitated I do find that CBD can be overstimulating for some patients remember CBD and lower doses can be what we call alerting like amp that doesn't make you sleepy but some people actually feel a little bit more energy on it and in higher doses can be sedating and it appears that for some of these kids right when we started at low dose if he actually became more agitated and as we went up it did appear to help a little bit some patients just had no response and then I had about 63% where the parents did report calmer behavior reduced or eliminated self-injurious behavior in fact communication and proof focus improved reports from therapists and teachers many of my families who start cannabis do not tell the therapists or teachers that their kids are gonna start oil because it's an unbiased report and so remember with parents you may be seeing things then you're not sure oh is that a positive is my child acting better you know you have four nights of sleep that are better okay is that count but teachers and therapists will tell you there's something different about your child I notice that your child is paying attention able to focus is participating in therapy and so I I'm not doing I'm not telling families to not tell people I talk I just say in the beginning don't say anything and see if you get some type of unbiased response back for autism patients I found dosing is lower than epilepsy patients they just don't need as much and it could be anywhere from one to three times a day although I do have one child who's doing phenomenally well on a combination of CBD and THC although the parents will have actually said they can see the oil wearing off at the 300 mark and so his behavior goes from he's doing great to become self injurious in fact that mom came in covered in black and blue marks and that's why she was seeking help but that always done well and they just give him there's dose every three hours it works and you know she asks is there something wrong with him then he needs it like that but that's his metabolism popular strains that are being used by my patients are Harlequin canna tonic ac/dc and Charlotte's Web for autism and then like I said high CBD to teach she can be to stimulating and by lowering the ratio sometimes we can balance it out for those patients now here's a case report of a ten year old girl with autism she had severe self-injurious behavior she was nonverbal significant anxiety and these are quotes from the parents when they came in she's not learning anything from therapy and we're prisoners in our own we don't go anywhere and I have to tell you that the dad spent the entire visit just kind of trying to corral her because she was touching everything she tried to open the door she's under the examining table on top of it it was exhausting just watching the dad doing that and that's what he does 24/7 we started her on whole plant CBD oil high ratio and it was just too stimulating and remember until she goes she does go to Africa school during the day and so what we decided to do at that point when they told me it just you know actually made her a little bit more aggressive we just decided to give her a little THC at nighttime to see what that would happen and lo and behold she of less anxiety less self injurious behavior she stayed in bed she normally wandered the house they would find her in all the front rooms and her sleep was improved so that was the beginning and then slowly what we did on the weekends when she was home and they could observe what was going on is we would add in we added in a little THC and we just kind of played this game where it's a little CVD a little THC just to find the balance and you can see her combination there are three milligrams of CBD plus three milligrams of THC and the doubt sent me an email and it basically low behaviors low anxiety less fixating her ABA therapists are seeing good day behaviors and no evidence of psycho activity at all and overall this family has said that their quality of life is tremendously improved and these are very low dose is very affordable pediatric cancer I'll go through it real quick as you know it can treat symptoms but remember two cannabinoids have been shown to actually inhibit tumor growth cause cancer cells to commit suicide and himmat metastases inhibit angiogenesis and recent literature has shown with some chemotherapy there are some synergism with with cannabis and chemotherapy to actually enhance cancer killing and so you know the majority of my patients that are coming to me many of them are just patients looking for help with side effects but seeing a very increased influx of patients with advanced cancers who've exhausted most options who either have treatment failure or chemo toxicity and they're just they're ready to try something else and remember it's been in the news and there's much more media exposure solutions are are reaching out I use combination high-dose TVB of THC we don't know the doses we don't have research there's not one human study using THC or C together for treating cancer there is a Polish case report and as you can see on these graphs this was a young lady in Canada who had a very difficult course if she fought cancer for 34 months and still was sent home with with hospice and her family decided to try cannabis she had a rare form of a ll acute lymphoblastic leukemia with a very aggressive chromosomal mutation and as you can see on these graphs on the left side shows how many blasts which are the leukemia cells and it shows if you'll notice the first five days of oil treatment had actually climbed and then it started dropping as they gave more oil and really what's interesting is that on day five they gave her enough where she felt euphoric and actually a little out of it and she got very hungry and so they knew it was in her system and a dose that was that she felt and that's when the leukemia cells started to drop as you can see in the second graph on the right it started climbing again well that was with a new syringe of oil and remember these were untested syringes at the didn't have testing ability so they just had transferred youngest one syringe and then they moved to another one and it was concentrated oil that they had no idea how many milligrams she's getting and they just decided to titrate up to a dose that where they would see the blast fall and as you can see it basically plummeted down what this particular case report shows is that it demonstrated disease control meaning it basically eliminated her leukemia in a nurse dose response curve as the oil went up the leukemia cells went down and not only once and not only twice but another time as well so it and this was in a child room is not receiving any other treatment and certainly was not getting a spontaneous regression because she was terminal this is my case report and I'll end after this okay I have a 16 year old boy I now turned 17 just recently in my practice who came to me with stage 4 osteosarcoma he came a year ago April after two years of intense ischemic intensive chemo yet over ten surgeries he was given 90 days to live the oncologist in this particular case was open to using cannabis and she sent two to me to see if it would just help with his end of life what's interesting is he was still on what we call palliative chemo they didn't want to withdraw chemo because it's very hard to do in a child who you know you just kind of you don't want to call it quits you know so he was on a drug called gemcitabine and it just so happens in the literature there's some evidence that gemcitabine + cannabinoids triggers some synergy so increase cancer killer and so I explained to the parents that we don't have any studies we have lots of animal studies and in vitro studies but do they want to go for it and of course they said yes and so we started him on low dose concentrated THC and CBD and I told them to increase it over a 1 to 2 month period they went way faster than I would have gone but they got him up to very high doses 500 milligrams of each the equal a thousand milligram of cannabinoid a day and that was April in July he had four scans MRI bone scan cat scan and PET scan showed no evidence of disease and this was a child that came to me with innumerable tumors in his lungs and his vertebra and in the primary site which is his left leg yeah I'm talking results what's interesting if after the cancer that he showed no evidence of cancer he developed really bad anxiety we don't know if it was the THC or that he teenagers know what's going on if he just got really anxious at first he thought he was dying and now he's not a lot of a big emotional rollercoaster for a teenager but we decreased the THC dose because it's a very high dose to sustain as of April I just saw him a few weeks ago he has scams in November and stands at the end of March he still shows no evidence of cancer he continues on you can see pretty high dose CBD and a lower dose of THC and he's chemo was actually stopped two months ago so we'll really see what happens now and then I just wanted to show this I love these pictures so his mom sent me these brochures so they're particularly nasty surgery they have to go into the vertebra because the tumor wasn't painting on his spinal cord and they actually had to cut the surgery short because they were afraid they were going to paralyze him and then that's him at Halloween he wasn't supposed to be here at Halloween so good for AJ I don't have time to go over hopefully this will be made available to you for psychiatric in the canvas the product requirements these are this is what I basically found you want concentrated oil so that patients can take small small amounts without having to take a large amount of oil consistent in stream if somebody finds a stream that works the last thing you want to find out is that you go to your supplier this oh we don't have that one anymore sorry I have to start over especially in pediatric patients if they're doing well a change in strain can actually wreak havoc and they can start having seizures again certainly laboratory tests it goes without saying affordable is a big issue I have seen oil as cheapest five cents and I say 35 cents here per milligram but I've even seen recently over $1 millon gram if you're taking 300 milligrams a day that is not sustainable that cannot nobody has that money to be able to do that and then a reliable supply the last thing you want to find out again is that somebody sold your oil to the supplier sold it to a different family or a new patient and when you go to pick it up the caesareans you know we have to wait for the next harvest so especially if you've weaned off medication now you're leaving a child in a situation where they're off medication you certainly want to make sure your supplier has his medicine and then this is just to review the overall approach pediatric patients I do start with low doses usually high CBD to low THC and for CBD dosing in general it's higher for cancer in epilepsy in most other conditions it's on the lower side THC dosing is start very low dosing we can add it in or use it separately it makes it easy when they're in two separate bottles and then often you know consider changing strain or the ratio it's not you're not responding and also I didn't plan your app you can also consider adding thta in my adult patience I go through again are they new to this or experience the methods of delivery i educate them about CBD and THC and then I just break it down into three categories so they have an idea of where to go when they're getting their medication and where to start and then there's a bunch of my kids that I take care of it I'm in love with so thank you very much thank you very much for that bunny you"
3z4oCQ0Wbkg,Cannabis and Bipolar Disorder: What do we know? What do we still need to learn?,2016-10-26T18:50:15Z,"These are in listen-only mode. Welcome everyone, thank you for joining our webinar with Andrew Penn, RN, MS, NP, APRN-BC. Andrew was trained as an adult nurse practitioner and psychiatric clinical nurse specialist at the University of California San Francisco. Mr. Penn currently serves as an assistant clinical professor at the UC San Francisco School of Nursing. Also he is a psychiatric nurse practitioner with Kaiser Permanente in California, where he provides psychopharmacological treatment for adult patients and specializes in the treatment of affective disorders and trauma. He has interest in promoting psychiatric wellness through exercise, meditation, and meaningful social relationships. He is also interested in emerging novel treatments for psychiatric disorders, is presented nationally, and is a passport member of the California Chapter of American Psychiatric Nurses Association. Today Mr. Penn will explore the controversy of using cannabis therapeutically for mood stabilization, anxiety reduction, and the promotion of sleep. He will explain how cannabis works in the brain, what we know about the risk of exacerbating mental illness, how to reduce these risks, and what we still need to learn before we know if cannabis can be therapeutic for bipolar patients. Welcome Andrew, we're so happy to have you with us today. Thanks for that introduction Debbie and thank you to you and Melissa for inviting me, and the International Bipolar Foundation for your interest in this topic, and thank all of you who are out there on your computers for taking some time out of your day to learn about this. So I'm coming to you from Redwood City, California, which is close to San Francisco, and I think it's always appropriate and professional to disclose one's biases before starting a program such as this, and one the things that I run into when people hear that I'm from San Francisco, when I present nationally on this topic, is they say, ""Oh, we  know what you're going to talk about,"" because my town is the place where an enterprising Girl Scout once set up a stand for her cookies outside of a medical cannabis dispensary and managed to sell a hundred and seventeen boxes in just two hours. But I want to be clear that I have no financial interest in the cannabis industry I'm not promoting the use of cannabis per se. I want to try and present some scientific evidence of what we have, what scientific evidence we have around cannabis specifically as it relates to bipolar disorder, and I also want to underscore that at my heart I am a clinician and not a researcher, so I'm leveraging the research that has been done by other people to try and sort of consolidate that information into something that's useful. But I am not a clinical researcher per se. I spend most of my day treating patients within the Kaiser Permanente system and teach on the side at UCSF and in the continuing education conferences. So I have no financial dog in this fight. So it's worth just doing a little review of the history of cannabis, if nothing else, because it's a fascinating history. Cannabis has been part of human culture and human medicine for 5,000 years now. There's history going back to China, to 2900 BC, that cannabis was used as fiber, as medicine. And it became more commonly known as a medicinal substance in the United States in  the 19th century, when it was often used in these sort of combination patent medicines, like this wild cough syrup here that contained alcohol, cannabis, chloroform, and morphine. I'm sure that probably did it ensure a very good night's sleep. (Excuse me) And interestingly cannabis became... yes? Can you hear me? (I'm sorry, but we are unable to see your slides, can you please try and click on the screen sharing button once again?) Oh sure, let's try that again. Hold on one second, thanks for your patience. Has that changed anything for you? (No, not yet) Can you see anything now? (There we go, there we go) (absolutely) They're working? Okay. (There were go. Thank you very much) There we go. There's that Girl Scout I spoke about. (There we go, excellent) Can you see the Girl Scout? (Yes, thank you very much) Okay, so as I was saying, cannabis came into some popularity in the 19th century in the United States as a means to actually help people get off of opiates, which were very commonly used at that time and were creating a lot of problems. In the 20th century, cannabis became vilified through such sort of propaganda films as Reefer Madness, and that's actually where the term ""marijuana"" started to be commonly used instead of the botanical term ""cannabis."" ""Marijuana"" was was used as a sort of a racist strategy to associate the cannabis plant with Mexican immigrants, who were commonly being vilified, unfortunately, during the racially-charged politics at that time. Of course we all know about cannabis's prominence in the 1960s subcultures, including some former presidential... former presidents that we've had. We went through the 1980s with this sort of backlash to the culture of the 1970s, with ""Just Say No"" from Nancy Reagan and vilification and prohibition of the drug. I would call this sort of the demonization of cannabis. And then since, really since probably the early 1990s, California had the first medical cannabis law in 1996 with Prop 215. We've kind of gone into this gray area of medical use and increasingly, which I sometimes call the ""cannibization"" of cannabis,"" and then we've gone into this sort of de facto or outright legalization as we've had in several states, such as Colorado and Washington, and really the culture has changed to the point where even our current president has admitted that he has used cannabis in the past. We have now 24 states with some degree of legalization or medicalization of cannabis, and there are five ballot propositions on the November election, including one in my own state of California, for some variation of either legalization or medicalization So it's very clear that the times have changed, that cannabis is increasingly being seen as being less risky and is being used somewhat more as a result, and we can kind of see where these cultural shifts happen as the lines cross over each other, in the mid-1980s with the ""Just Say No"" campaign, and then the shift again with Bill Clinton being the first president to admit to having used cannabis, albeit not in healing, in the early 1990s. And what I'm finding with my patients is that this sort of idea of just saying ""no"" to something is really, it's really inadequate, and what my patients want to know - they want to know about the drugs they're using, and I want them to know about the drugs they're using. because I'm a big believer in harm reduction. The idea of harm reduction is that the total abstinence is not always the goal. It's not always the patients' goal and it may not be the goal of treatment, but that any movement towards using less substance, using it later in life, and using it through safer routes is a step in the right direction. I think if harm reduction had a bumper sticker slogan, it would be ""don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good."" So any reduction in use or in the change in the pattern of use is a step in the right direction. So I'm going to refer back to harm reduction several times in the course of this talk, because it's really a guiding philosophy that I use in my daily practice with patients. So before it's about cannabis as a plant, cannabis is... there are two primary species of cannabis, so the word ""cannabis"" is the genus in the scientific taxonomy, and the species, the two most common species are sativa and indica. In more sophisticated hybridization growing methods a lot of times the material from these two plants are hybridized to create kind of a combination plant. In general, sativas are considered to be more stimulating and have a more cerebral mental kind of intoxication effect. For some people they do cause more anxiety, and sometimes they are higher in THC and lower in a compound call cannabidiol, which I'll talk about more in a moment. Indica is the species which is generally considered more sedating, has more of a sort of physical intoxicating effect, often is more anxiolytic, or reducing in anxiety, and can be lowering THC and raising CBD. Now, most people are familiar with smoking cannabis in the form of a cigarette or a pipe, and the part of the plant which is typically smoked is the unfertilized flower or bud of the plant, which is where there is a structure called ""trichome"" which is where these cannabinoids, the active ingredients in cannabis, are concentrated. There is some in the leaf of the plant, but most of those cannabinoids are concentrated in the bud, particularly THC. Increasingly in more recent years, there's long been hashish, which is a dry concentration of these cannabinoids, but with more sophisticated production methods there have been ways of extracting these cannabinoids from the bud with things like butane and other solvents to create such things known as hash oil, shatter, wax.. These are all terms that can be used interchangeably. And these are very concentrated forms of cannabinoids. Just to give a little bit of a orientation to measure, a very common measurement, the unit of measurement in cannabis is the eighth of an ounce, so these are sort of relative sizes of, obviously this would vary in the density of the plant, but to give some idea of when we're talking about measurements, and when I'm talking with patients I will often ask them how long it takes them to go through an eighth of an ounce, because that gives me sort of a ballpark idea of how much cannabis somebody is using. Cannabis can also be ingested orally, and this is increasing this is increasingly, particularly in states that have legalized or states that have medicalized cannabis, There are edible versions of this drug that can be ingested orally and there are even topical salves that can be a relief. One of the challenges that I'll talk about a little more in a few minutes, with ingested cannabis there's an issue of unclear labeling, which can lead to somebody taking more than they are thinking, taking more than they should, But then there's also the delayed onset with smoking or inhaling cannabis, the onset is usually fairly rapid and the person will usually somewhat self-limit how much they're taking, depending on the subject I can take down up to an hour or more before the intoxication effect occurs and that can sometimes lead to people getting impatient and taking a second dose right about the time that the first dose is starting to come on, and then being surprised by the intensity of the intoxication. So when we talk about cannabis, it's important to be clear that the plant is a carrier for a very complex amalgam of different chemicals. There's over 450 compounds in cannabis and what most people are familiar with are what are known are fibocannabinoids - so, cannabinoids made by the plant The cannabinoid that most people are familiar with is tetrahydrocannabinol, which is THC, and this is the psychoactive part of the drug. There are about 65 other cannabinoids besides THC. One that is getting increasingly more press is cannabidiol, or CBD. This is a non-psychoactive part of the plant, so by non-psychoactive I mean it doesn't make you intoxicated, doesn't create.. doesn't make you high. And there are others that are less well-studied, but there's increasing interest in looking at these for their own therapeutic potential as well. So one of the things that's interesting about cannabis is that one brains, our central nervous system, our bodies, actually have a relationship with this drug, and the parallel that many of you may be familiar with is the opioid system. So as you probably know, we have receptors for opioids in our body, and when they're made by our own body we call them endorphins. And this poses the question of, well if we have a receptor for cannabis, why is that? Our bodies... have they been created to use cannabis? And the answer to that is ""no,"" but what it turns out is that what's called the endocannabinoid system, the body's own cannabinoid receptors, and the cannabinoids that plug into those  receptors play an important role in regulating neural activity within the central nervous system. So this is kind of a crude diagram. To the left is two neurons connecting to each other, and as you may know they don't connect, they don't actually touch each other. There is a gap between them known as a synapse, and that gap is bridged by a release of these neurotransmitters. So to the right is a bit crude schematic of a neuron talking to another neuron, And we call this, a neuron that's releasing the signal is called the presynaptic neuron, and the neuron that is receiving is called the postsynaptic neuron. So usually a signal comes down the line and it's passed on down by these little neurotransmitters, which have made it, symbolized by these green triangles, and this could be things like serotonin or dopamine or norepinephrine among others. They plug into receptors on the postsynaptic side, which then sends that - if enough receptors get occupied, that signal then gets passed down the line. So enter in the endocannabinoid system. So you might think of this as an excitatory process. The presynaptic neuron is telling the next neuron down the line ""go, pass this message down the line."" You could think of it as sort of like an old-fashioned game of telephone where one person passes a message for the other person, who passes it to another person. With the endocannabinoid system, the receptors are actually on the presynaptic side, so they're on the side that is usually releasing information to the next neuron to pass it down the chain. And the neurotransmitters are actually released from the other side, so this is called retrograde signaling. So these endocannabinoids, the most well-known is something called anandamide, are released by the postsynaptic side, the receiving, typically the receiving side of the neuron, and their job is to go up to the neuron that's releasing the neurotransmitters and say ""whoa, hold up, hold up."" It's kind of like if you've ever helped somebody move and there's a bunch of you, and you're all passing boxes down the line and then stacking them in a storage room or something like that, and the person who's doing the stacking city is getting a little overwhelmed by how fast the boxes are coming, and that person's holding up the chain. This is kind of how endocannabinoids work. So these endocannabinoids send a signal back upstream and say, ""wait, hold up!"" and this is exactly also where exogenously, or outside the body, cannabinoids such as THC have a mechanism. So why do we even have this system in our brain? The person who discovered THC, an Israeli scientist named Raphael Mechoulam, discovered THC in 1964. He isolated that from the plant and he said, ""you know, it's unlikely that nature would create a compound so a kid in San Francisco can get high."" And so when we find these things in the brain, we have to ask ourselves ""what's the purpose of it?"" And what it appears that some of the functions of the endocannabinoid systems are to regulate things such a relaxation and sleep, appetite regulation and memory and forgetting, which is - memory and forgetting is an interesting subject, because when you think about it, most of what we encounter in the course of a day, we actually don't need to help onto. So for example I can tell you what I had for dinner last night, but if you ask me in 10 days what I had for dinner last night, I won't remember because frankly it doesn't really matter. So a lot of what goes into our minds and brains we don't need to hold onto. But the brain has to figure out, what does it hold onto, what does it let go of? And it may be that endocannbinoids play a role in that. Now if you look at this triad of functions you can also see that these are exactly some of the same things that people are using cannabis for, possibly therapeutically and also may point to some of the side effects, which are very common with cannabis, such as cognitive problems, which we'll talk about in a few minutes. If you really want to take a deeper dive on this, I really love this website, it's designed for people without a neuroscience background, has some kind of fun and playful animations that illustrate the mechanism of action of a number of different substances. So if you want to check this out the web address is on the bottom, if you just Google ""Mouse Party"" you'll probably find it pretty easily. So it's important to make the point that cannabis use exists on a continuum. Don't get too hypnotized by the spinning cannabis leaf there, ranging everywhere from no use to a very chaotic dependent relationship with cannabis. And there are plenty of people who exist somewhere along this continuum who may use only occasionally, who may use a few times a week, who may use daily, who may use all day long. And it's it's important for us to think about cannabis use along this continuum rather than thinking of it categorically as something that is either ""yes"" or ""no."" We do know that we have a huge problem with overdoses in this country right now. We're facing an epidemic of drug of overdoses and one thing, one good news that I can report is that they are not coming from cannabis, they are largely coming from pharmaceutical opiates, and sadly as we've begun to all put limits on and come to our senses about the prescription of opiates in the medical field, We've seen people switching to heroin and to illicitly acquired pharmaceutical opiates and we've seen an uptick in overdose deaths over the last dozen or so years. Alcohol also accounts for a number of these overdose deaths Cannabis, fortunately because there are no receptors for cannabis in the areas of the brain which control breathing, unlike opiates, an overdose of cannabis might make somebody very intoxicated, but it's not necessarily going to result in them dying. Now... let's start talking about some of the risks of cannabis. We definitely know that the earlier somebody starts using cannabis, the more likely they are to develop what we call a cannabis use disorder, which, in lay language, might be considered a cannabis dependency. So as you can see from the downward trend in this chart, if somebody starts in early adolescence, they are much higher risk of developing they are much higher risk of developing ongoing cannabis use. So one of my recurrent messages in this is, the longer somebody can wait to use cannabis, the better. Cannabis dependency is more likely to happen, as mentioned, in the younger people, and it's about half the rate for people who start as adults. It's about the same use that people who begin as adults will begin to develop a dependency upon the drug. So about one in ten - that is a similar rate to those who begin to use alcohol, so people who use alcohol, about one in ten people will develop a problem with that particular drug. So again waiting to use this drug is related in everyone's best interest. Another area of concern is is there a cognitive risk in using cannabis, and there are some larger called ""cohort studies"" where a big chunk of people are followed from early in life until later in life, and they're measured a long way on different measures of things like intelligence and mental illness markers and substance use. There's a group out of New Zealand, in the  town of Dunedin, New Zealand, it's been followed for I believe over 40 years now, and there's been an association found that the young people who began using cannabis heavily in adolescence were found to have a loss of IQ of about six  points when they're retested against at 38. There was some drop in intelligence quotient scores in people who began using cannabis as adults, but it was not as significant as those who began using in childhood or adolescence and began using heavily. So again I think this really underscores the point that waiting... the longer somebody waits to begin using cannabis, the less likely it is to be impactful for them. Now speaking about bipolar specifically, because I'm sure many of you in the audience... pardon me. I'm sure many of you in the audience are interested in this specifically as it relates to bipolar. It's very well established that there is a strong comorbidity (is the term we use in my line of work), or correlation if you will, between substance use and bipolar disorder. About forty percent of people with bipolar disorder will have a problem with substances at some point in their life, and about twenty percent will develop a cannabis use disorder. So cannabis is second really only to alcohol, AUD is alcohol use disorder on this on this graph here. It's second only to alcohol as the most commonly problematically used substance in bipolar populations. And there's also data that indicates that people who develop bipolar disorder will develop it an an earlier age, about three years earlier, with ongoing substance abuse, and this was looking at different - not only cannabis, but other substances such as alcohol. So particularly, my advice to somebody who is more vulnerable for developing bipolar disorder, say somebody has a parent or more than one parent who has bipolar disorder, somebody with a real strong family history or a sibling with bipolar disorder, I would definitely caution them to stay away from cannabis because of the risk of developing bipolar disorder at an earlier age. Now if somebody already has bipolar disorder and is using, there is data is to suggest that people who continue to use cannabis with their bipolar disorder tend to stay manic and/or depressed longer than those who don't use cannabis. I think it's also worth pointing out here that tobacco is also a risk for longer durations of depression and mania. so that middle middle store or into their the middle graph there is a depression scale and the one on the right is a mania scale so we see these increased risk in people who the is less less likely to to go into remission from depression and mania if one is using if one is using tobacco and canvas together and tobacco also creates a risk for longer duration of illness episodes wheel with a related illness of course there's this sort of fuzzy territory the twins is for any and bipolar disorder sometimes we call that schizoaffective disorder when working at schizophrenia populations that schizophrenia generally begins about three years earlier the people that are heavily exposed to cannabis which is which distance thing but it again practice for people that having genetic loading for cannabis check for schizophrenia to definitely avoid the use of cannabis in the in study again one of these cohort studies following a group of young men from recruiting or between first and seventh grade before they began using cannabis up until the age of 18 that each year of regular cannabis used to increase the level of what we call subclinical so they don't actually meet the diagnostic criteria for disease such as schizophrenia that they were developed they were showing these these symptoms related to those illnesses such as paranoia and auditory hallucinations so for each year of regular cannabis use the risk of developing those kind of symptoms increased by about twenty percent and some of it for some of these subjects that these symptoms persisted even after they stopped using now one thing that's unclear about this is is it that the young man in this study who gravitated towards using canvas might they had already been showing symptoms of a psychotic illness such as schizophrenia and then were drawn to cannabis as a result of that or to the cannabis cause the symptoms that we're seeing its it's difficult to to make that clarification sometimes that direction of causation are directional correlation is difficult to establish I often get asked him if there are genetic markers that might predispose somebody too great a risk of developing a psychotic illness if exposed to cannabis there are a couple of targets that you know targets the one called CMT and this is for this codes for an enzyme that breaks down and things like dopamine and if you're a carrier of one particular variation of this gene there's a correlation between developing psychotic symptoms at a younger age if exposed to campus over a different gene one called akt1 this is a gene which if present in a certain way so it won't what's called an allele tends to predict or somebody developing paranoid symptoms when using canvas now for some people paranoid symptoms create a kind of a self-limitation with cannabis use so if you become paranoid a lot of times people don't want to continue using the next that's probably a good thing because if you are a carrier of this gene and use cannabis daily heavily and daily there was as a seven times higher risk of developing a psychotic disorder with that kind of use pattern so my take-home message and this is if you get paranoid when you use cannabis don't use it it's probably not a good thing for you i'm now this question of does cannabis make you easy does it make you what we call a volitional this is a an area of research that's really kind of lively right now there are some people that say a lot of people who gravitate towards using cannabis are depressed and people with depression are often lacking in motivation just as a feature of the depression and so then it may be that particularly in adults that cannabis use is more than 30 let me rephrase that that the adults the lack of motivation that we see in people with cannabis use maybe better accounted for by depression as some newer research looking at an area of the brain known as the nucleus accumbens which is the area that lights up when we get rewarded this is an area you know when you're thirsty and you take a tall drink of water if we could look at your new police accumbens we would see it light up because it's it's being rewarded its own please one of the things that happens with repeated use of drugs that are intoxicating is that the response this area of the brain has to the drug becomes less and less and this is also the area of the brain which we need in order to motivate it towards a reward and that reward might be being told that you got the job or being told that you got into the school you wanted two were being told it yes that person will go out on a date if that area of the brain becomes kind of blunted then we would stand to reason that there might be a decrease in motivation towards these kind of the sort of daily life rewards so this is really my take-home message for young people is the longer you can wait sana are good the it was referring to psychosis and it's smoking the pot you want but wait until you're 30 and I recognize this is difficult because the average age of spreading canvas use in the united states is about 17 so we really could do a better job with educating our young people to hold off and tell their at least into their mid-twenties now I know a lot of people a lot of my patients use canvas for treatment of anxiety and this is the Association orange lines being bipolar populations anxiety as many of you in my audience know is a very common code traveler with bipolar disorder and it's it makes people might use cannabis to try and palliate that it's it's interesting to look at this in young people because so this is an interesting piece of DNA about thirty percent of people who qualified for a cannabis use disorder which means that they use it regularly also had social anxiety disorder but interestingly have four over four fifths of those people reported that they had the social anxiety disorder before they started to use cannabis and I think this is really important to to look at this so that the cannabis did not the cannabis the the social anxiety predated the cannabis use so what this tells me is if you're a socially anxious young person and many and frankly you know many of us were when we were young that cannabis might be a very attractive way of dealing with that anxiety but the problem with social anxiety and avoiding the things that make us anxious is that we never develop mastery over them so it's normal to be anxious when we're young there's many things that we haven't done we've never gotten a job we've never ask somebody out for a date etc and if we every time we feel beings 90 of a threat the anxiety generated by happens to do one of those those things we use canvas to deal with anxiety and then we don't go and do the thing that we're making this making shank making is anxious we never get the opportunity to really master that skill and I think this is sometimes where some people refer to serve an emotional stud- i find that somewhat of a pejorative term but this version to taking risks socially they sometimes see in my young adult canvas using patients now cannabis as medicine is a very thorny subject and i'll tell you right now this is the sort of how this is set up we have way we are way behind as a scientific community in understanding the benefits of cannabis and what that means is we have a lot of user reports a lot of anecdotal data which is usually considered a fairly low quality because it's not controlled for things like bias there's a lot of people who have found benefit and cannabis and are convinced that it's working for them and they may well be right but the primary now is as as clinicians we don't have a lot of scientific data to guide us and this is in part because we have this very convoluted system as to how canvas gets approved for clinical studies in the United States and I'm not going to belabor this too much but I the there are a lot of barriers that exist to doing my research around cannabis as a therapeutic drug that don't exist for other pharmaceutical drugs and this is some of these restrictions have been lifted in recent months by the Obama administration but the biggest restriction is that canvas remains a schedule 1 the DEA drug enforcement administration considers a schedule 1 drug which by definition isn't drug that has a high potential for abuse and at low and and no therapeutic benefits so it begins challenging to try and study it as a therapeutic drug because by definition it doesn't have any therapeutic basis as far as the federal government is concerned and that's a real problem for getting good data so what as schematically this is that we have a lot of states that have medical cannabis laws this is any an ad from one in my state and as you can see it's sort of listed as a sort of panacea for all sorts of conditions and very few of these conditions we actually have data for that it helps now you'll have lots of anecdotal data and somebody again maybe absolutely true we don't have good scientific community guy this where we do have some data for THC is in these conditions so nausea and vomiting multiple sclerosis neuropathic pain and anorexia loss of appetite and weight loss and conditions like cancer and aids from the psychiatric standpoint the the compound that i'm most interested in is have a da e there is some preliminary data that shows that this is helpful in things like anxiety and may actually even be an intern psychotic this was a comparison to a drug called camisole pride which is that in a psychotic that is generally that it's not a print in the United States butts and used widely in other parts of the world comparing a high dose of cannabidiol much more than you could really get for me any kind of smoked plant matters is really purified can have a dial comparing it to the school pride and finding it equally effective as an anti-psychotic because a very tantalizing result on a lot of my patients use cannabis for sleep and particularly cannabis indica we do it again we don't have great data on this i have plenty of anecdotal the data that anecdotal evidence that would say that it's helpful one of one finding that is certainly makes sense to me is if somebody has chronic pain and their pain is reduced by the cannabis use in their sleep quality is generally better but we don't have a lot of good data that cannabis actually help sleep but i certainly have a lot of anecdotal data from my patients that there are some studies looking at various psychiatric conditions and cannabis again they're difficult to do because of all the federal restrictions this is one that if you're interested in looking at you can go to clinical trials that God's this is regarding PTSD and held cannabis clinical trials.gov is a clearinghouse for ongoing clinical trials all should know about it it's a great website for searchable you can use a google style text box and where you can take in something like bipolar and and cannabis and your geographic location and see what comes up so for people who are already using kind of getting in the home stretch here I want to leave some time for questions these are the kind of places where I look to reduce harm let me go through some of these briefly if you are already using one of things that I'm interested in with my patients as I want to understand the pattern of how somebody uses and so I might ask them to keep a checklist like this and just put a check in the box when you use and we'll see if there's any kind of pattern in this particular example made here this is clearly somebody who's using a lot in the evening and uses doesn't use very much during the day except on weekends so with somebody like this i might say hey can we figure out a way to help you with your sleep if the campus is creating side effects that they're they're not pleased with and there are also some apps such as this one I called joint effort that comes out of Australia to help people track their cannabis use i also asked the people be unconscious how much they're using to actually get a scale and weigh out how much they're actually using to get a real measured sense and to also begin to read labels we're all familiar with the labels on food in states that have medical or recreational cannabis there are often labels that break down the amount of different compounds such as THC there is some question as to how trustworthy these labels are there's not a lot of standardization in this industry and plants by definition can be somewhat inconsistent so if the blood is on the top of the plant that may have more THC than a bud it's on the bottom of the plant and there's some data that's that's found that these labels may actually be over reporting that the amount of THC and the product I i caution my patients to be very careful with highly concentrated cannabinoids these hash oils or shatter wax the higher the THC content more likely they are to cause psychotic like symptoms and also I I really advise people to stay away from synthetic cannabinoids which are known as spice or k2 because these while they mimic THC they often bind to that cannabinoid receptor much more tightly than THC and can cause a lot of psychotic like symptoms if somebody is eating to be careful with how much they eat and to go slowly and have a sense of that dose can labeling is helpful and if they're smoking to to try and use a vaporized method instead of actually smoking which spares the lungs the hot papers answer had combustion products that come from smoking cannabis with patients who are using I try and find ways that they can reduce their use for example using canvas only after the kids have gone to bed or after work so that they're not played the side effects of things that cognitive problems if they are in a state that does have some automatic was a issue legalization of cannabis to get legitimate sources so that they're not exposing themselves to the potential harm of legal action and to use products with lower THC and higher CBD and of course not to drive and especially not combined with alcohol because that does present some risks and i'm really not here to say whether somebody's canvas use appropriate or not I think that really depends on each individual person I really would caution young people under the age of 25 to try and stay away from it for as long as possible so really this is a conversation to have with individual clinicians and with the people around you to take a look and see what kind of sign of x and benefits they may see from some of these candidates use and then to really have any a thoughtful conversation with your providers with the people aren't with that with your loved ones about cannabis use so with that I'm going to go ahead and open up to questions thanks for letting me go a little bit over here and we started a few minutes late but I cannot think he's going to moderate questions and i'll be i'll do my best to answer them great thank you very much for your presentation that we do have a few questions coming and and the first simple question is what does couch look for excusing couch lock mean couch lock is that the term that that I got your workout then let everyone from one of my patients where you just youyou don't want to get up you want to just lie on the couch and watch TV or play video games and and really not do anything it's sort of a slang term for sedation great thank you and the next question is the harmful effect data for daily use and/or for occasional use as well so the the harm the harmful effects particularly the studies around psychosis there's a clear uptick in people in the harm the risk of harm for people who use it daily and use it heavily daily different studies of defining the term heavily but really another opportunity for harm reduction is to move from daily used to what's more will be considered more occasional use so once or twice a week for example really it seems like daily at perturbing the endocannabinoid system on a daily basis particularly during that window of development of the adolescent and young adult brain is probably not good for the brain particular somebody who is predisposed to mental illness genetically Sun Thank You the next question i'm curious as to what the relationship is between adverse childhood experiences or trauma and cannabis use mental health diagnosis well that's a great question it sounds like the writers is referring to the adverse childhood experiences study which is a landmark study that came out of kaiser number of years ago looking at that kind of load of how adverse childhood experiences such as being sexually or physically abused not having a parent present etc and that the higher the number of those kind of adverse experiences somebody had the more likely they were to go on to develop not only mental health problems but physical health problems such as heart disease I'm not well-versed in the correlation between address travel experiences in cannabis use i would not be surprised if there is a positive correlation between the two but I don't have that data at my fingertips that's a great question i'll have to check it out we thank you and the next question is if someone doesn't have a doctor to ask because they can't afford etc and advice do you have any recommendations or you can refer back to finding impersonal condition if somebody doesn't have a clinician to work with is that the question right yeah I mean you know it's sort of a two-part problem because we have a shortage of psychiatric providers in this country and i would say we have a shortage of psychiatric providers for sophisticated in this subject unfortunately there's still a residual of a lot of anti-drug propaganda that really lacked a lot of nuance and sophistication and so there are a lot of providers who have a very kind of all or nothing approach to use the canvas which is unfortunate because i think what that tends to do is to make people be secretive about their cannabis use them feel ashamed of it and it and it doesn't allow for the the patient if you want me to use that term to really have a full rotation with that clinicians and so it's sort of a two-part problem was finding a condition that you can work with afford and the other is finding a condition that you feel comfortable talking about your cannabis use with and you know I think it's okay to ask straight up a clinician tell me you're at your feelings about about cannabis I want to understand i'd like to know that about you I think that's a fair question asked when you're interviewing a provider i want to go back and add a second answer to the question about adverse childhood experiences one thing that i have seen clinically is that sometimes some of my patients who are using a lot of cannabis more than you might consider to be recreational and by that I would mean they're using cannabis from the start of the day to the end of the day I mean that to me is a red flag that somebody is trying to treat something that can be as most people don't need to be intoxicated all day long if somebody needs to be under the influence of cannabis all day long they start to wonder what are they actually trying to treat with that and it's not uncommon that what i find is that somebody is doing a lot of trauma and that they're trying to manage their fluctuating anxiety and hyper vigilance and a related distress to that trauma by using cannabis so that's that means sometimes a red flag that there may be some drama going on and I often sometimes find before people are diagnosed with bipolar disorder that people are using large amounts of cannabis are sometimes trying to manage some of the energy and mood fluctuations that are that accompany a bipolar disorder great thank you for that answer and the next question is any suggestions as to how to quit using cannabis yeah so you know we're not very good as clinicians at helping people get off of cannabis because for a long time it was thought about to be physiologically addicted to a big fan of the word addiction but it doesn't fit in creative physiologic dependency and the reality is is that it does now the withdrawal is not as dramatic as it is from some other substances say alcohol or opiates but a lot of people when they go to stop using cannabis will experience things such as insomnia i'm at a loss of appetite agitation irritability I'm so one way of approaching this is to to try and taper to use increasingly lower THC containing compounds there has been a little bit of study looking at any over-the-counter supplement called n-acetylcysteine often abbreviated and neck or any seat well this is a amino acid that can be bought over the counter that in a couple of studies has been found to help this is in younger people in teenagers going through a substance abuse treatment program were able to go longer without using cannabis when taking 1,200 milligrams twice a day of NAC which is generally pretty well tolerated and i'll use this strategy with my patients sometimes I'm there's been a few small trials looking at gabapentin and two pyruvate tokamaks as ways of helping people reduce cannabis use kind of mixed data as to how helpful it is in the future there may be a product available that's actually normal spring it's a combination of cannabidiol one part cannabidiol and one part THC it's goes by the brimming with Sativex it's not approved in the united states yet but is used in Europe and in Canada to to help with the pain and spasticity people get with multiple sclerosis and I think it might be a useful tool to use will call off label to help people reduce cannabis and has been ordered to taper off of cannabis in much the same way we might use a drug like Librium to help somebody detox from regular alcohol use I think there's some interesting things on the horizon that are not available yet in the united states that might be in the not-too-distant future great thank you also what would you do what type of approach would you use to encourage young people to get off of the cannabis or reduce their intake well you know yeah especially living in california which the states had medical marijuana years now this idea of cannabis as medicine is a very common one and so I sit so somebody comes to me and says you know I use cannabis additionally the first thing i want to do as well what are you treating with it and I not explore that with them don't make any judgment on whether or not that's a good or a bad idea what I really want to do is I want to understand it and so i'll start by asking questions like will tell me about how it helps you and then later in conversation might have a conversation about how what are the side effects that you notice because you know we're talking about this is medicine all medicines have side effects there's no minutes in the world that doesn't have side effects and talk about cannabis as medicine that includes cannabis and it you know if we're having that kind of candid conversation sometimes people will say you know I noticed that i'm not a sharp in school or not forgetting things and then that gives me opportunities to start talking about where might you start reducing your use and other places where you could perhaps use less or if somebody really is a sophisticated consumer of cannabis and is using a dispensary and has access to lower THC products could you use our tht product in these situations where your cognition is is needs to be preserved to really try and start reducing it i'm if somebody's really ready to to sort of on the cusp about maybe stopping i might suggest a whether you do it sober month or two just take a take a couple months off from the drug and let's let's take that information that you gain from that and compared to how you're doing now and see if there's any benefit and see what you see if also any kind of symptoms emerged that were have quieted down by cannabis and maybe that gives us targets for treating them differently there may be other might be medications that are far more useful for more effective for treating that symptom that perhaps don't have the same side effect burden and ultimately the reason I use that scale graphic in that my last slide is because ultimately everyone needs to make a decision for themselves and how much benefit of the gang from whatever substance is whether it's cannabis or lithium or depakote it doesn't matter the benefit has to outweigh the costs and the costs are side effects and the stigma of taking the drug and having to the lab and having the pharmacy that's all of the cost side so as a clinician it's really on me to find something that that works that has more benefits and costs and that's the that's always a conversation to have with patients and and I really believe in a very conversational approach to providing mental health care great thank you do you have any information around using sleep aids with cannabis or to help us sleep issues it's so i'm assuming my sleep aids are talking about prescription medications and I'm sorry for people yes you and prescription or over-the-counter sleep aids yeah you know there isn't any any good studies about this and I'm aware of anecdotally I certainly didn't just think of a patient i was talking to yesterday who said he takes clonazepam and had some cannabis he sleeps very soundly so i would suspect particularly the more sedating strains of cannabis the indica strains are which and more that sedating effect are going to an additive effect within any prescription medications uniting them you start coming finding drugs there you can get into sort of unpredictable effects so I think caution is definitely warranted and i would i would say the same thing about legal substances such as alcohol I mean honestly I'd be far more concerned about somebody coming in and saying that they were taking ambien with a with a big glass of wine that would that would actually worried me a lot more because those two together are much more likely to be really dangerous but that said I don't wanna I'm not I'm not endorsing the use of sleeping with cannabis because it's we just don't really know about the safety of it great thank you on the next question my son had a complete psychotic episode while wait school at 19 years old using involuntarily admitted to the hospital and had nothing other than marijuana in the system he spent three days in a psych ward was diagnosed with bipolar he's currently on meds and see psychiatrists regularly my question is could this marijuana have caused him to become bipolar or be diagnosed or was it just the perfect storm I'm really sorry to hear about your son you know it will never know obviously I'm and I'm not and I'm not really sure how much benefit anybody gets from and doing at packing moving on sentimentalist you know it's that is exactly the age at which most people develop either bipolar or schizophrenic schizophrenia and so we'll never know because there isn't a it's not like a clinical trial where there's a control group where there's an exact replica of your son who didn't have the same cannabis exposure i think really at this point what's probably more important is just moving forward and getting your son good care and at this point if he were my patient i would strongly advise them to stay away from candidates because of this is already had this experience of having a psychiatric episode after using cannabis so and from a standpoint of safety and cost and i would definitely advise him to steer clear of it I still there yes can you hear me now hope ok walking him ok next question is have you personally seen any clinical improvement of a psychiatric condition and a patient from cannabis use I've seen improvement of symptoms i think and limited symptoms i would say that the probably most symptoms up I've probably seen with the most improvement or sleep with cannabis use occasionally with patients that are having real problems of with weight loss i've seen some improvement and and being able to maintain weight with canvas with regards to what sort of other common psychiatric symptoms such as as depression and anxiety and mood instability we honestly with with my bipolar patients who are having a lot of problems with with mood and energy and stability it would be one of the areas that i would say you know this is something we can we can look at this is this is a modifiable part of your condition I mean we can't control for your genetics we can control for your biology but your canvas using something you can modify and so you know again i'm i'm interested in information of interest in india so somebody is willing to say you know what I'll take six months off and let's see how it goes and we'll keep everything else the same weekend medications the same and they come in they say you know I feel a lot worse since I stopped using cannabis and I first of all would wonder what do they mean by worse you know that by that might be there more anxious and we might have more insomnia and those are targetable areas of treatment and I say you know let's let's do a better job of treating insomnia let's do a better job treating your anxiety but it's it's a difficult question answer so I i think i have seen some sort of palliative benefits of cannabis use in some of my patients but certainly not enough that I can enthusiastically recommend it for anybody because i think for a lot of people the side effect burden is a lot higher than the benefit and frankly i would say the same thing about a lot of our pharmaceutical drugs so again i might my bias that I disclosed to the beginning of it is that i don't have any interest in another financial interests in the cannabis industry i also don't have a financial interest in the pharmaceutical industry so I have some nights I also have some skepticism about the drugs that we prescribe conventions for bipolar disorder of some are great like with them think what they very drunk I think we'll know dreams really great drug summer not state and as training videos in this audiences taking someone's probably has a list of both good and bad drugs for them and and their good and bad drugs might not be the same as as the person sitting next to them so again individualized medicine i think what we really need to do is as conditions is work with work with patients to find what works for them and in order to have that conversation we need to create an environment where our patients feel comfortable being totally forthright about their substances great thank you on the next question for young or occasion for young regular or occasional users under 30 if they quit now are there benefits for quitting now and that gap time or has the damage already been done mmm that's good question i don't really know if it's been studied you know if you look in those in this cohort studies like that the one out of New Zealand the way that they measure that is that they would check in with these folks every three years or so and one of the measures were is a mess pero use and so for people that have fewer instances of so they're actually diagnosing for what musical cannabis dependency is now called cannabis use disorder dsm-5 but people that had repeated diagnosis of cannabis dependence or more likely to show those declines in IQ score compared to those who had fewer episode fewer points in time where they met criteria for that diagnosis so I think I I wouldn't say that the damage has been done i think one of the very one of the central tenants of harm reduction is it's never too late to quit so if somebody wants to stop using even if they've used for a while I would be all for and I don't ever say well entertainment system done so you might want to keep using I think anytime somebody wants to reduce the user stop I'm all in favor of that great thank you the next question is there an alternative for dealing with social anxiety other than cannabis sure i think the the best and long most long-lasting treatment is to gradually do the thing that's frightening and i know most patients with anxiety disorders when I brings up they look at me kind of sideways and you've got to be kidding and i'm not talking about somebody socially anxious should suddenly oh I don't know get on our webinar with a few hundred people and all i have to say this is a lot easier to be sitting staring out my window of my office and talking to my computer than it is talking to 500 people in the conference call it makes my social anxiety a lot easier but to gradually do the things that we can make me anxious I really think is the best treatment in and you're working with a good therapist who is familiar with this idea of exposure therapy to create a hierarchy of fears and start with the easy stuff first and get some mastery over little things like it might be something as simple as being okay with raising your hand in class and you you start by doing that in the class that has the nicest people with the nicest teacher or your your most comfortable and then you move up to the class that maybe isn't quite so friendly and and so on and so on but just gradually gaining that sense of mastery of like yeah I'm scared but I can do this that's really the core thing that we need and that we all need to get as we grow and develop and adolescence that's sort of the central task of being a young person is getting a sense that yeah this is scary this adult stuff but I can do it I've done it before and I can do it again and there are medications that helps them up with social anxiety and some of the serotonin reuptake inhibitors have some benefit in and social anxiety but really there's no substitute for actually going out doing the thing that's right Michelle says you know we all have anxiety it's just part of being human but how we want to handle it is is is important great Thank You the next question i use cannabis to counteract mania feelings does this increased depression um you know it's hard for me to know without knowing the person more closely i would ask them to I think for a lot of people making a particularly early mania takes the form of anxiety those kind of raising the odds and inability to sleep can feel very much that right not just like anxiety they are anxiety I'm you know and if we think about me as an increased state of energy increase thinking in and worry is a is a form of it is a form of that energy increases between me and so I think for some people they definitely find some subjective benefit in using cannabis to go to curtail their be exciting that they feel in that state I think what I would ask this person oppose working with them clinically would be what else do you find when you do that you know somebody might tell me where I can then then i can sleep if I can start sleeping it kind of dampens down the mania whereas if I don't sleep i'm gonna start running out and getting more manic you know then it might be beneficial in that particular case can't speak to that broadly and have to really understand the details of the individual in front of me if somebody said yeah I use it but then I start getting paranoid it's saying is that really the way you want to be treating your meeting with something that makes you paranoid might we find him there's something that's not going to make yours so that's a long answer your question but I hope it helps create thank you so many questions and do you have time for some additional questions and you or I can do about to walk again yeah I can do about 10 more minutes of questions and then I've gotta scoot to in my clinic so I Association patients actually actually absolutely thank you so much for extending that your time with us next question is can you comment happy little girls yes very much so and can be comment on mixing cannabis with seroquel are all marked typically questions just rhian and you need to answer based on a print on a personal basis and so these we should leave out okay i mean in yeah i mean i don't be able to comment on specific drugs with cannabis may I think it's it's so the conventional wisdom is that that psychiatric medications are less effective with when combined with cannabis now you know what honestly we really need data to support that I don't know if that's true or not my clinical experience would say that that is the case because you're particularly with things like psychotic disorders if somebody is is is taking it now don't know why the person taking seroquel of course we use that in many different conditions bipolar psychosis sometimes use even small quantities just for sleeping medication use it off label for anxiety so without knowing again more about the person but if if somebody's taking it for a psychotic condition and then they're adding a drug which potentially can increase psychotic symptoms your kind of working at cross-purposes and so I think it would depend on why the person is taking seroquel and again I would want to individually explore that person's experience with the combination of these two drugs like I i wouldn't be able to say no I wouldn't be able to say that just in general that that there's a strong with that other there maybe with that particular person but in general I think in a lot of times when people are combined in canvas with psychiatric man's there are times when it it makes her condition worse there may be times anecdotally want to make some better i would really love to have some good studies on this to guide me so I anymore but it's those kinds of studies are really pretty difficult to do great thank you for the response to that question and the balance of our questions are related to personal situations with medication and cannabis so I think we're going to wrap it up here i just want to say thank you for this very engaging and insightful discussion i'm very happy to have this webinar uh take place today and also be recorded and archived on our website for future viewing or sharing with others and so thank you everyone for joining us and thank you mr. pen for joining us as well and have a great day well thank you for taking time out today and I appreciate everyone's interested i hope it's been helpful thank you all right take care"

VtwSBbrX_cY,The device changing the medical marijuana industry,2016-11-28T13:45:14Z,humboldt is a cannabis health and wellness company through science we identify the properties of cannabis that are effective to help you sleep or help you with pain relief for anti-anxiety and then we use technology to create devices that deliver those compounds in a effective and consistent dose so if I draw on this for three seconds there's a slight vibration at the end and that indicates that you've received 2.25 milligrams of our formulation because a lot of times if you're been a cannabis user we hear over and over again they try to duplicate the effect that they had maybe last week but the genetics are different even though the strain might be the same the crop was a little different their inhalation is going to be taking more in and the response from their body is almost scary sometimes because they don't know what's going on so being able to eliminate that risk I think is a key value that Humboldt brings I think there's a huge opportunity for the cannabis industry and for humbles specifically to do more research have more science involved in the products I think the thing about the legislation most recently is the momentum for both the medical cannabis and also the recreational cannabis and I think it's created a lot of interest now in the industry and now we have 28 available markets for us in the United States to serve a lot of consumers are now saying this must be more safe than I've heard before and being in the medical cannabis business versus the recreational we're able to address I think specific needs so if the interest created says hey I have pain I have sleep issues maybe this is a solution for me that's safe and we're that safe choice we're excited with the feedback that we're getting and the lives that we've already been changing through our products

gMDyZPr2Cz0,Australia cautiously enters medical marijuana market,2017-07-14T13:59:42Z,a secret location housing the beginnings of Australia's homegrown medical marijuana industry the country legalized medicinal use last year and these government sanctioned mother plants will be cloned to provide crops for the future we are now seeing the start of it it's where the exciting times being at the forefront of a brand new industry but we're putting in place all of the requirements to to be able to allow patients access as soon as possible to medicinal cannabis so far only imported products are available but red tape and cloudy laws mean low patient numbers while doctors are hesitant to prescribe it erielle Hardy used to endure 100 seizures a day which were aggravated by traditional anti epileptic medication her desperate parents recently tried small doses of a cannabis derivative known as CBD and the five-year-olds condition has improved remarkably I still don't think we've actually found the right combination but it's incredibly difficult to to do that when you're in a situation where you can't be prescribed something there are no physicians who can tell you exactly what you need to know and what is going to work and what's going to be more helpful than than than others so that that is what really makes it a difficult situation researchers estimate a domestic market could initially be worth more than 75 million dollars a year but advocates say the misunderstood planet still suffers from a past as an illegal drug so that we can say yes it's inherently safe there are side effects I mean not everyone wants to go to work intoxicating cannabis but this is where the subtlety of the plan comes in it's really important to realise that you can get the medicinal benefits from cannabinoids without necessarily being intoxicated with THC at least a dozen licenses have been issued since last year's green light allowing cultivation research and manufacturing paving the way for Australia's fledging industry to join a multi-billion dollar global market
K-BrUjw7uZo,Leaf - full lenght australian medical cannabis documentary,2017-11-12T08:50:48Z,"[Music] [ __ ] quadriplegic cerebral palsy an undiagnosed uncontrolled epilepsy Sooey takes nothing by mouth she's nil by mouth she used to wait for her it's been a downhill slide she used to have anywhere from 100 to hundred tonic-clonic seizures and died they think she has some unknown regressive syndrome they don't know what's wrong with her Bella was diagnosed with a genetic epilepsy at the age of four it is called dravet syndrome my daughter Caitlin's sprague ins 8 years old and she's got 19 medical conditions ranging from play to carefully microcephaly communicating hydrocephalus esophagus dysmotility tract in Malaysia scoliosis hypertonia global developmental delay obstructive sleep apnea with hyperventilation and the major one being refractory epilepsy [Music] [Laughter] kaitland first started on mullah ways medical cannabis and she's been on that for just over two years now that was working to reduce her seizures and as a seizure rescue med Kaitlyn got used to the medication and it still reduces her seizures but it will not stop a seizure so I am now sourcing another product on top of mullah ways which is Jenny Hallam's Foucault and that's the only medicine I have found to stop my daughter's seizures where I don't have to give my daughter CPR starting the cannabis it's just like I can see his eyes like you'd look at him and you can just see this little soul looking back at you trying to talk I poked my tongue he copies a lot you know he's he's starting to squeeze my hand a bit more I just feel that I can feel his presence now for us sue is in a better place because she's not having a hundred or 200 seizures a day she might have one seizure a day or ten seizures a day or one seizure a week it depends on house how her health is at the time so she's in a far better place on the cannabis and what she was so I've basically been dropping her medications myself using cannabis oil and she's had like significant gains in cognitive ability and energy levels and health every seizure that my daughter or any child has can be their last seizure because seizures can kill a child epilepsy can kill Kaitlyn's real high prioritize she is a lot better now being on cannabis medicine but beforehand I can't take my eyes off my daughter she can sit there and smile 1 minute 2 seconds later she'll be blue and not breathing there's no warning especially with first seizures I had no option like I'm watching my son seizure they told me there's no more meds for him there's nothing more we can do you know got told to plan a funeral for him two years ago I don't think I'm a criminal whatsoever you know I felt more of a criminal pushing a non fda-approved medication in my son than I do now I go out and about into the community and not feel like my sons gonna die within a second if he has a seizure because his medication pharmaceutical suitable medication never worked it never did anything you just seizure and knock himself out so I don't think I'm a curling or whatsoever I believe that I'm saving my child it is against the law we realize that but you know there's a bigger issue than what's against the law what's not against the law and there's a moral issue and the moral issue is is even though we're breaking a law we don't think we're criminals because I don't think it's a criminal act a safer child what I'm doing is against the law I'm classified as a criminal but in my eyes I don't see myself as a criminal I'm saving my daughter's life and I'll keep breaking the law to save my daughter's life it is not legal it is not people are living in fear I have been I have been terrified of living with this because you never know who's gonna die beu in the school even said to me this year we can't assure you that we won't then nobody will dub you in detail is basically about cannabis you South Wales to the girls state the world of cannabis is the same as it was 12 months ago five years ago that is criminal movies to possess cannabis it's a criminal offence to use cameras but it's a criminal offense to supply cannabis a criminal of institute grow cannabis whether it's for medicinal purposes or to get stoned and have a bit of it's I am very much in favor of medical cannabis as a variety of conditions and medical problems can be addressed from attic until I'm not a doctor had not my field but from I know from talking lots and lots of people over the recent years it works for a whole lot of people and unfortunately the legal situation hasn't quite caught up with the community in terms of the interests of there in ecstasy those products hopefully basically medical cannabis is a human right we need to take back the right to choose what medicines we put into our bodies and that rights been taken away what both the federal and New South Wales governments have done is takes on what I think are very very baby steps towards legalizing medicinal plants they've created a structure a framework where people who are wanting to produce medicinal cannabis products can apply for licences they've created a structure where people who are patients or wanted to use the product or products for medicinal reasons can apply through their doctor for prescription the doctor has to go through an enormous be complicated rigmarole to get permission to prescribe so we're still very much stuck in that medical model of thinking about medicinal cannabis has only something that can be provided by a doctor with the government giving approval to the doctor on a case-by-case basis with a process that takes probably twelve months or more haven't yet seen anybody get through the process as far as I know so twelve months or more of procedure to get an individual person access to a product my view is we could have a much more relaxed approach to medicinal cannabis and have a much more open process where people could in a realistic basis access medicinal cannabis tinctures and oils and so on for safely and appropriately through a legal process that we much less complicated than at the moment the legislation is as it stands on medical cannabis is there's no sale they have made a dog's breakfast or something they should have been incredibly simple I think what we need to have to accept is that cannabis works for a lot of people trying to make it too elaborately structured in terms of have managing access or controlling access I think is not in the best interest of people who are using cannabis more distantly the so my whole view though about cannabis laws is that perhaps not the same as other people's I think they're generally the cannabis laws should be relaxed so that people should be able to grow cannabis or smoke cannabis for recreational so-called recreational purposes as well but even if we're just diminutive medicinal purposes and we could have a legal arrangement where it was a legal defense to the public more stayed in place allying with a fence for people to say sorry for people who are using cannabis positionally to not be guilty of offences just on the basis of dignity with this book has its own rate that would be not a difficult law to pass it would not cause the floodgates problem in terms of everybody using cannabis pretending they've got transferred between they've got some other condition and it would the result would be that people would be able to lawfully access cannabis products which they are doing anyway they're tens of thousands really the number of people are using cannabis products these days is very very large none no one didn't know I would suspect tens of thousands of people across the across the strata are using it those people are not a risk to society anonymous to civilization there are people in their friends and family who are attempting to do the right thing by sick people and thus about time the government caught up with that and passed some very simple laws to allow legal exemptions from the general criminal law for people in that situation it's no I mean we can grow natura we can grow boxes but this road belladonna it's quite legal and oleander that can kill people and we're allowed to grow those in their garden so why hell aren't we allowed to grow a plant to can't kill anyone we can buy paracetamol and aspirin and ibuprofen at the supermarket is no regulation whatsoever all of those drugs cause deaths every year cannabis doesn't I think the government's approach would be to first of all concentrate on relieving that humanitarian need and dealing with it on a compassionate basis people and politicians use the term compassion but they don't seem to remember what the dictionary definition of compassion is when is this madness gonna stop the people made this medicine and they don't need it in three months six months they need it now tomorrow and that could be done with the stroke of a pen and we have a government that refuses to acknowledge that the use of cannabis possession of cannabis for whatever reason remains illegal so unless you're on the terminal illness scheme unless you've got a terminal illness and you've registered your condition with the New South Wales police you are likely to be arrested and charged if the police come across you likely to be arrested and charged with possession or supply or or cultivation of incest depending on the situation I have to worry about killing your patient it's a very comforting thing for your doctor not to have to worry that began until their patient I think it's marvelous so cannabis should be treated as a first line medicine and if it fails then we have a whole world of pharmacy leads to fall back on and it will won't work for everybody it's no one's ever said it's a panacea or a cure-all or whatever so you know there's really this there is enough room for cannabis in the pharmaceutical industry but they want to control it all and therein lies the problem that's the bottom line if the focus should really be on providing or allowing access to adequate treatment rather than trying to penalize people in the context of a law that really doesn't make a lot of sense anyway about the general use of cannabis there is no way to measure I don't think it costs about the whole as compared to Canada it's just a so much greater that it's extraordinary it's an extraordinary indictment of our society that that drug is legal and the one that can't kill you is illegal all you can do is imagine how awful I must be for a parent to see a child with epilepsy having 5100 fits a day knowing that the conventional medicine isn't working what you can do is have nothing but that compassion and sympathy for those parents if cannabis works I'm the parent I'd be having no hesitation in using cannabis products that work that's not to say it's going to work for everybody and of course periods and anyone needs to be careful about the things they put into their body of course that's part of the responsibility we all have is notice as as adults and as parents we have responsibilities are for our kids but certainly there's a whole lot of evidence for a lot of childhood conditions like a purpose in particular that cannabis works when other products don't other pledges our medicine doesn't and the legal situation unfortunately hasn't caught up with that yet my advice to parents would be do what's right for your kids worry about the legal consequences later chances are you won't get caught by the place anyway but if there is a legal consequence worry about that later that's a second issue the second water issue commences look after your kids look after family do the life email in order to for there to have been a crime committed there needs to be a victim where are the victims the victims are now guys that are deprived of the oil so who's actually committed the crime what cannabis and alcohol have in common is a very widely used in the community then used for for most people who use who have a beer or two or have a joint or to do that it's some level to relax to I suppose deal with the pressures of modern life and whether it's a glass of scotch after a busy day or a joint at the end of a busy day the same social result is it's a little bit of release a little bit of relaxation for most people that causes no harm at all to the community and there should be no lowering post this is because of aveer and there should be no law imposes here she comes for Tory who's it actually potentially harming you know only the pharmacy that company's chances of take control in the industry you know it's not having the child you know this is the thing and it's the same as that and it's this is what we have to keep coming back to it cannot kill you like how many times does this have to be drummed into politicians heads until the general public's heads it is the safest medicine we have on earth I've asked for amnesty so a lot of times and I can understand what they say when they say we cannot give you anything to break the law so change the law if the government can't give me amnesty they most won't hand me a death certificate because that's what they're basically doing I feel that we need amnesty for our children or our family and all other families like us I mean wouldn't you call for an amnesty if you really found that something is helping your child wouldn't you want the people to hear that's not just for Caitlyn there's millions of kids out there suffering and adults we we just need it legalized and we can't wait we really can't I think medical cannabis is a great idea and it should be legalized obviously everywhere what I heard it's there that are gonna help the people who get QE from like cancer I've heard a lot of things about medical cannabis and I have to say I'm really for it I would really like to see that happen I'm all for it I have had knee replacements a lot of pain I did see the doctor yesterday in regards to it and it stole various stories that has been legalized but still hasn't been worked out how they're going to distribute it I'm all for I'm all for it I I've done some research on it and I've seen the effects the good effect it does to children with seizures people in pain I think it's having to it's a really good thing that's been held back by the government for way too long I think medical cannabis is good you know for people that need it like I was gonna save lives in why not all my opinion on medical cannabis is I think it's been a long time coming sure you know it I lived in America for about 10 years back in the nineties and seemed to be under the on the on the radar there but under the radar so to speak is it was used there back in the 90s and I think pretty well I mean just seeing some of the results lately that some of those young kids with some of those some of those diseases they've got I think really helps really build Canyon on medical cannabis as I think that should be legalized the species for medicinal purposes for our pain for cancer patients we're Paige Paige our family members died of cancer and it was just the most horrible disease and if they can be pain-free of us through this module and all cannabis also seeing children having hippy efforts you know cannabis oil should be legalized as well ya know I'm all for I have no contact with cannabis but I still feel like it's a you know a tradition sometimes it from the very beginning of the medical process medical history it is used as some kind of treatment to relieve the pain so I think it is if it is under control it could be good but I think it would help patients immensely having worked with on college of patients for quite a number of years I've seen the suffering and everything the just being found in bed with chemo inside them I think this would help such an awful lot I've seen a lot of misery and that nothing this would help pain covers all ages the best method whether you're a child or night person you miss up a pint you need to have some form of relief I think medical cannabis should be legalized years ago before I jump the shark it went into politics I think my last story for the Sunday night program on the Seven Network was about medicinal cannabis and cannabis oil and the cases where people talk to people parents being arrested and charged because they were buying or producing themselves marijuana plants or cannabis oil for their kids for the epileptic kids for the kids who having seizures like you wouldn't believe and and we had cases where where a young mother telling me that her daughter suddenly had eleven hundred seizures and now didn't have any of this extraordinary stuff I have about a hundred and fifty families with their kids have Tourette's syndrome or you know they suffer from seizures autism things like that it's about 150 families some of them have two and even three kids with the same problems but the siege they don't have seizures anymore or anything and I probably look after about a hundred or so people with brain you know cancers brain tumors you know things like usually inoperable stuff you know they're not isolated cases but we've been buried under an avalanche of needy patients but it's sad that we can only get to a fraction of the people that approaches and stuff the our governments allowed in is twice and three times the price what you can get doll for black market for now that's the government allowing something to come into the country that's free times the price you can get off a black moon the hell's going to use it when we support a young child with epilepsy cost the parents approximately one hundred and fifty dollars a month for a similar product imported through pharmaceutical avenues it's $1,500 a month right the gouging at the sick and needy so I got you know literally thousands and thousands people on the waiting list you know yeah I can only look out for a couple hundred people at a time last year's of Mardi Gras had a mother with a baby who's who had improved incredibly since she started the access to the oil the parents get their family life back the siblings aren't anymore sidelined by the disease but it becomes a functional family again the level of stress is just like in our air out of a balloon that just lets down you can just feel that the stress going down it's transformational not only for the patient the siblings and the parents and then the larger society transformational so I can say we've had people suffer daily pain for 11 years and be cured within five days of starting cannabis for neuropathic pain right we see that often they're suffering horrendous side-effects and expenses from allopathic treatments that can just be blown away by the right medicine a few of the mothers and that have come up to me since I've been up here they start crying and everything the street you know told me how happy they are to meet me and every you know I don't know what and what I've done for their families and that you know yeah it makes a big difference you know yeah well you know it's like a lot of mothers who said to me it's not that they've got a kid back they finally have their kid you know they've never had it before and now they have a kid you know those that'll make a difference wouldn't you know the government oppose home growing because it's the antithesis of the reason they brought the prohibition in the first place it basically empowers the people but in disempowers a corporation it provides a very strong price counterbalance against corporate greed so what's changed you know if somebody can say well I get access to it now because of what the government's done and Rohde I've fallen but as far as I know there's 20 odd people that access this stuff that costs them one hundred and forty dollars a day through the government thankss and there's 20 people in the country that access now I have a waiting list of thousands of people wouldn't they access that if it was possible at least trying for starters as a stopgap decriminalize it it just it is it is crazy when the police come realized that it was people's medicine so taking it wasn't planes you know I think the police at the time realized what was happening you know and what they done that wasn't there you know where they were busting some big local syndicate or anything you know everything was being recorded it was all going to genuine sick people I kept all the information for them people of them people and every week and I just basically grew the plants to help the people that can't help themselves you know can't door themselves sometimes to people derive a huge amount especially wheelchair-bound people things like that other forms of physical disability engaging in the growing process having their own tent having a daily activity while they watch the medicine grow and then process it through is by itself a therapeutic activity I'll look after over 150 families with kids with surveyed syndrome and not if I was to stop giving it to them we could have a massive death and kids so diet or won't stop the next stage of these kids have because they haven't had them for years could kill them you know well the very next seizure that we're gonna have could have been the one that killed which gotta kill them we don't know but we do know that sooner or later they were going to die from having seizures that's how it happens and they usually live to about ten you know well I've got them over 30 now and they're coming off the medicine and that well they're not even needing the teachers anymore and they've gone from having thousand diseases in a day to none you know for four or five years it's a no-brainer and I just can't understand why more governments haven't embraced it and more heavily interested recognize the campus is a medicine we're basically reinventing our currency were reinventing medicines and I also think we're reinventing humanity is everything at Ground Zero while reinventing the man for being nice or you join the benefit I came involved with cannabis oil because I needed it myself I have a serious body wide chronic pain and nerve damage issue I have a resting pain level of about six out of ten every day I was using morphine for probably bout 15 years as well as oxycodone and lyrica and those sort of things and I was getting sicker and sicker from I got down to about 38 kilos before I started just using cannabis by itself and then I discovered the cannabis oil and that helped me get off on all of those medications and now I just use cannabis oil alone well it changed my life it saved my life when I was on the other medications there were horrible side effects to them I used to scratch my skin off because it was it was so itchy I used to get terrible stomach problems from it and and it was just it was a horrible drug so the cannabis oil doesn't have any of those side effects it doesn't have any side effects whatsoever I can have virtually normal life using it other than the problems with the law started helping other people because they saw what it was doing for me and they asked what I was doing and I told them I was using cannabis oil and they asked whether it might help for them and I said well I thought it probably would so I started sharing it with other people and and it worked for them and then their friends would ask them and and their family would ask them and and they would tell them what they were using and then they would ask if they could get some as well and and it sort of went from there so it was really word-of-mouth at the beginning Jenny Hallam I've been sourcing her cannabis medicine going on would be about eight months now and it's working marvelous for my daughter Jenny Hamlin was raided back in January this year by the South Australian police and they basically took everything I had a phone call from Jenny that day to say please don't you have to reduce the oil until I can get back up up and running again generally the fourth of this year police raided my home they came in I warned them at the door that I was that there was cannabis and cannabis oil on the premises that I was making oil for people that were sick and dying and there anything that they took that day could result in somebody's death I told them that before they walked in the door and they still came in they still took cannabis and they still took cannabis oil so on the day I wasn't arrested or charged they just seized the the oil and the cannabis yeah supply is how can I put it very unreliable the moment because we were getting it from Jenny Hallam who was recently rated this year and who's currently going to court so we're not sure what's going to happen most of the people that are helping have contacted me they're all very worried about me and how I'm coping but they're also extremely worried about their supply and whether or not they will be able to still keep getting that supply and whether or not their lives are at stake or at risk she's a lovely lady and I don't believe anything like that should be happening to her and the way she's healing people it's we call it our healers not our suppliers and they heal our kids they're the one people that are ready to stand up and then go to jail for it my charges were both for possession and supply which carries a penalty of two years but the the more important one was the manufacture charge which is a major inaudible fence and carries a penalty of up to 7 years which is considered a life sentence so with the two combined it could be nine years she may be breaking the law but I don't think she's wrong and I think I think they're wrong in targeting her because what they're doing could cause or contribute to the death of my daughter my name is Karen Burch from the Church of Ubuntu in Newcastle on the coat I'm vice president of the Church of Ubuntu in Newcastle [Music] approximately three years ago I witnessed a three-year-old boy named Oscar go from 1,500 seizures one day to five the next after a capsule of medicinal cannabis and that was the day that I decided to dedicate my life to cannabis we can get up to a hundred calls for assistance each week the phones are ringing off the hook it's really sad to watch pair fearful of try and cannabis and because it's illegal and it's so sad they're choosing you know every seizures like being punched in the head so if they're choosing to have their children continually be punched in the head because they don't believe that they can do something use a plant which is really crazy does that yeah that's how crazy is every politician needs to spend a day in the life of a child with epilepsy and the the scream you hear is sort of like a it's something that never leaves you once you hear it you can't forget it doesn't get out it keeps ringing in your head and I can best describe it probably as terror there in terror they're like their bodies spasming they've got absolutely no control that what's going on with these electrical currents running through their body and they're petrified and their family are petrified and a lot of their parent families are separated a lot of them are single parents because there's too much pressure and there's just so many different variables you know for the child there's so many different challenges for the family it's really yeah they really need help they really really need help all of them now it's critical we know that it works just let us do what we do and we'll be done it just gives you more fuel every time you see a child die there's another log of passion octane has loved room arose ocean Kisco in Western Australia all the children that have been this is about all the children that have been forced into the pharmaceutical medicine that is causing more harm than good we were raided on the 1st of December 2000 1716 they took 215 plants and they were for we have a hundred children that we're supporting with epilepsy so those 215 plants would have been two plants for each child which would have been medicine for probably about 12 months and now it's the right thing but um it causes a lot of destruction in my life and I just um I just rather be left alone to assist the people that have come to us for help it's not legal like they say it's a legal form for synthetic what their government want to sell off to us yet again to make their profits it's unfair to tell the public that you can get it when you can't families are struggling still and now we feel that the community you think we're liars or we're lazy parents that don't take our kid to the doctors to get them get cannabis from around and go the black market like it's not fair the government need to come out and tell the public what is really happening and why we can't get it and why our kids are dying still and why we're being labeled criminals when you know they're allowed to have a doctor and a white coat give it but if a parent has it from a plant growing from the ground and we're criminals like it doesn't make sense anymore being told it's legal but all the headlines in the papers all over media it's it's all just lies they say you can go to your local doctor and get a prescription to be get it imported it's all just lies there is Hadley no doctors who will write out a script to import it we'll think it is and they say oh well they should shut up now because they've got their little cannabis but it's it's not but not fishy at all doctors definitely should have stood up like my doctor who I tried to educate two years ago she they should have stood up by now they should have looked at it they should have known that in other countries they use it that you know if we're in such a subgroup of people the Dravet Syndrome you know they should be educating themselves earlier and providing us with the best medical treatment if they say they're a super Hospital they should have the super best therapies for our children not have us go and have to investigate ourselves and then when we do and we try to bring it to them and even to the point where we've asked the Health Minister get involved to to provide that because they're not still not doing it so I think that the doctor should be freed up to be allowed to help us more that that it is a lot of government bureaucracy stopping medical treatment of people the product might be illegal but it's keeping their child alive so they basically can say I'll use an illegal product for now because if I don't if I wait for the legal products my child won't be here to need that legal product so it's all well and good to say wait wait for the legal product don't use an illegal product but when you don't have time to wait you that's that's not a choice you you have to do what you have to do and the people that are using my products and my oils know that it's a safe product they know that it's a good product and so they would rather risk having a product off the black market than waiting and having a dead child you've got people doing media people doing protests all sorts of things happening and there's been so much media about it and yet ultimately we've gained nothing we still can't get a product we still can't get anything and the media you'll see a media releasing our headlines cannabis legalized well it's not actually legalized there's a they've created a legal pathway but we can't we can't go that pathway because we've we can't afford it or you can't get a specialist to help you or it's just my it's made virtually impossible we think it's all just smoke and mirrors you know they say that it's legal but it's like dangling this carrot in front of people that they just keep pulling away at the last minute if it was legal people wouldn't still be accessing an illegal supply they wouldn't be risking their lives their freedom their families for something that they didn't absolutely have to do so this talk that it's legal that it's available it's just it's all crap basically and and we're tired of of being manipulated by the government we're tired of them offering things to the people that are standing up making all the noise so the families that are in the media that you know have stood up and and said that they're using cannabis they're the ones that are offered these special little deals but not everybody else so we're not happy about it we're not happy about the way the government's dealt with things and we don't think it's acceptable the way that they're not listening to us and what we want we need in a meeting immediately - tea for the people that are using it so they can use it without fear and that's the one thing that they just won't give us and we can't understand why not they've given a gun amnesty in the past why can't they give an amnesty to save people's lives a lot of research needs to be done on this and we do need to get doctors on board and I understand why they have to have the trials but let us mothers who've been doing this for two years allow us to still do it and just help like help us if we have to come to emergency help us don't make us into criminals the main reason why I have been arguing and been asking for amnesty is it would make a big difference to Caitlyn and it's not just for hospital admissions my daughter would be able to attend school the teachers would be able to administer the cannabis medicine and my daughter would be able to interact and socialize with other kids and try to have an education because at the moment she where refused an education before when my son was on pharmaceutical medications he would never look in your eyes it would be rarely and when he did it would he'll probably have a seizure five minutes later because it was just too much stimulation him demon try and focus on you he was asleep I was watching my son pass away on the couch he wouldn't move you know even his six-year-old sister too sat there and gave up you could see she used to play with him all the time and then she just realized she couldn't do anything with him so she stopped I had to slow down his physio because he couldn't have too much physio because it was just too much for him he'd see just straight away I feel felt lost six months ago I felt depressed and upset but I was happy and I never knew why I felt upset like I was happy I had my family I still have my son which is a blessing but I had come to conclusion that I feel that I was upset and depressed because I was watching my son and I feel like I was getting his vibe of death it was upsetting to feel it was a cold feeling you know he just couldn't get any contact you know he couldn't hold you he just flop but now you know I can hug it mean he can see him smelling me so it's crazy real crazy and this is why I'll fight to death to keep my son and kind of us and he will never have the pharmaceutical meds again because no one ever decided to check if he was allergic to these medications which I have but now I've got proof that he's like he can't filter any of this through him that's why he ended up having so many seizures so yeah having our son wake and even his six-year-old or my six-year-old daughter says it you know it's good that we're seeing chase wait mommy like he did this medicine works so it's it's we do more with him and we can do so much more with him now and it's it's brought our family back not just him nothing at this point has hurt my daughter using cannabis in fact I feel like I saved her life because the amounts of medication she was on when she was eight before I started were enormous and had I continued down the path of him adding more in there which they would do I don't know if it should be alive because the kind of us they get it can they can get a good sleep they can get seizure control they can get they can speak they can sing they can be happy they can forget the trauma as well before Caitlyn went on cannabis medicine she was a vegetable in a wheelchair she couldn't eye age she couldn't communicate it she couldn't hold anything in her hand she basically couldn't do anything she wouldn't follow you with her eyes she wouldn't do anything and since being on cannabis medicine she's listening she's my daughter's alive for the first time ever since going on cannabis medicine we found my daughter alive and it wasn't just me who noticed it the school teachers noticed that the doctors noticed it I had my 85 year old grandmother arguing with me do not put your daughter on cannabis Katrina I don't want Caitlyn on cannabis after three days of going putting Caitlyn on cannabis medicine my grandmother turned around said it's the best thing I could have ever done for Caitlyn I always thought it was amazing honestly not only for us like it made our life easier I said that were actually contemplating one of us going back to work because she wasn't going to hospital she wasn't sick anymore she was going along really well and we're amazed that the result it was actually a better result than we'd hoped for it was yeah we she also had a brain lesion that they were monitoring every six months by MRI a lesion and a brain that was slowly growing which disappeared the hospital the hospital says there's no evidence that there was the cannabis but there is no evidence that it wasn't either so here's all we know is on after eight months on the cannabis all that brain lesion disappeared the effects that I've seen the positive effects I've seen from cannabis use and kind of soil amazing nothing short of almost miraculous I've seen children with epilepsy having hundreds of seizures a day down to nothing I've seen children with epilepsy that were basically reduced to a vegetable coming back and interacting with their families again and going back to school and learning and picking up a book and reading it I've seen MS patients who basically couldn't even work anymore and and you know were basically reduced to just a dribbling miss on the couch up and active again and going back to work I've seen cancer patients who had cancer diagnosed cancers completely gone in fact this week alone I've had news from two different people that I've been helping one is a little thirteen-year-old girl with a brain tumor her tumor has liquefied and basically has been told that it's it's now it's not active anymore and then another lady with breast cancer who has also been told that she's clear of cancer so just in one week two stories of cancers that are basically gone I've seen people in chronic pain that were unable to do anything that are now having active lives again the the difference is amazing it is truly amazing and is exactly why I do it and it's the reason why people risk their freedom to take it and you're not worried about going to worried about my son being taken it's still the fear aspect it's still the fact that you're still out there in the community and anybody can report you and Doc's turning up was quite like you know I pride myself on being the best mom I have four children and I'm an overachiever so to have that was just it's just it's it did get the conflict and that is it does your head in we were reported to docs in June July 2015 and Doc said to put it on her medical record so we've been reported to docs the future for change the docs I'm on bit worried like I know a hundred percent I care for my son with every bit of my heart and so I give him everything he need to give him the love he needs I understand him you know give him the time to understand him but I believe that our system isn't improving me hearing my son I think it's disgusting that child services are actually considering taking children away from parents that are using cannabis all for their children they are trying to save their children's lives most of these parents have been told by doctors that there's nothing else that they can do to take their children home to let them die peacefully basically there's nothing else we can do so for these parents they are doing basically the only thing that they know to save their kids lives they are doing something that they don't want to do they don't take this decision lightly they don't take the decision to break the law you know lightly it's something that they organized over and is very hard for them to do and and they shouldn't be put in this position another parent a friend of mine Jason David he has a dispensary in California and hundreds of children go there with children like Bella and they're able to reverse and get them off pharmaceuticals there so they've been doing that now for two years and Here I am and we've got nowhere yeah I've tried it I've tried using cannabis and getting it down and I've asked for medical help I've told them about my friends nobody seems to care so these GP said the legislation is putting more regulations on cannabis than any other drug like morphine or whatever he can write a prescription out for morphine and there's no questions I've been told by the government within a a month to two months there'll be growers here and I'll be able to get a THC product here do you think I really can believe them when all they have done is lied to me about the product they've offered me no I don't believe them I've lost faith in the hospital system and the Queensland government they don't care I had a meeting with Queensland premier on 20th of January this year at that meeting the premier offered me access to a legal product they said they would test the product we're using to find out the ratios of CBD and THC they would source a similar product from Canada to arraign Canada and that it would be provided free of charge for the rest of my daughter's life on a compassionate basis we've tried and it's all eventuated to nothing I have been moved by the stories of families with young children with epilepsy suffering the life-threatening seizures and what they have to go through on a daily basis today marks another milestone for those who have campaigned tirelessly for changes that will allow access to medicinal cannabis the Minister for Health will introduce into the Parliament today the public health medicinal cannabis bill 2016 my government has listened to the many points of view on this issue including from the parents of children with treatment resistant conditions who stand to benefit from this legislation that is why we have collaborated closely with New South Wales Victoria come on mr. speaker this legislation will provide a transparent and robust regulatory framework to manage access to medicinal cannabis it has been informed by consultation with medical specialists and stakeholder groups Hospital and Health Services and importantly members of the public and potential recipients consume consultation feedback was overwhelmingly supportive of the government's access scheme mr. speaker let me be very clear that this is in no way a green light for the recreational use of cannabis nor for people to grow their own cannabis even if for therapeutic use these activities remain offences under the drugs from issue stark of 1986 however the lawful production of medicinal cannabis does present opportunity for Queensland businesses to supply goods to this expanding market my government is working closely with industry representatives to assist them to participate in the Commonwealth's licensing scheme for cultivation and manufacturer of medicinal cannabis I think the government is trying to control it so strictly because they want to control the supply and I think they want to control the supply and direct it to the pharmaceutical companies because I think the pharmaceutical companies are putting pressure on them to make it the way that they want it so if the pharmaceutical companies can't profit out of it they don't want us to be able to have it basically pharmaceutical companies don't want us well because there's no profit in well people they profit when we're sick so if we start using cannabis oil we'll get better and then they'll lose the money so unless they can find a way to profit out of it themselves they won't really want us to be able to access it and they'll do anything they can to make sure that doesn't happen the government need to wake up and realize this medicine works what why do we need to Casa as a schedule a tour scheduled whatever drug the medicine works it's a natural plant what grows in the ground how how can you say it is that bad there is no one has ever died from cannabis medicine no one has ever died from cannabis alone what I care about is my daughter and others like her who need a medicinal cannabis product now if the government cannot provide something that's accessible and affordable well then something has to be done or let us make our own law or let us why not let us why can't the government approve it test it for safety like the product we're using now I've put it to the government so many times why can't we get some form of approval for us to be able to use the product we're using in the hospital and in the school until there's an affordable and accessible local product made now they can test it for safety if they if they're worried about safety they can test it for safety so do it does my head in because there's no logical sane reason for not letting us use what we're using when for two years there has not been one adverse side effect and only a benefit but we're told no it's illegal well it is illegal to change the law laws can be changed government's do it every day I've asked the government to test my oil I've asked the government to put me in a lab and let me work for them and let me create a supply until a legal supply is available that government doesn't want to do that you know I spend a lot of time with these politicians and speaking with these top politicians and and most of them you can see are affected by what's happening in but and but what I've heard but they still don't do anything about it there's no not doing anything solidly about it you know we've got a few odd politicians around the place that are working their backsides often that are trying to push things through but that's not enough we need everybody's support and when you know we have politicians that say oh yes we support her but then they're not really supporting it when it comes to actually pushing these bills through Parliament then we have to ask ourselves why is this happening and and that's something that we don't understand either as you know cannabis activists and and campaigners we don't understand why it's taking so long we don't understand why we are having to fight so hard to save people's lives it shouldn't be this hard so we would like to know from the government ourselves why is this taking so long they talk about they don't have enough evidence enough clinical evidence on whether it works the safety of cannabis or whatever but there's evidence out there in in Israel in Canada in America but they say there's no evidence in Australia well they will use evidence from other countries to try and discredit cannabis but they won't use the evidence from other countries to try and give it credit I seriously I just I can't understand that it's all about profit in the government now you know trying to make profits and it sickens me I feel sick that they're doing this and my daughter's up there on pharmaceuticals and I have to jump hoops now to get legal cannabis what would you do if with one of your kids and it could be epilepsy just epilepsy can strike you anybody at any time can have a seizure if the premier of Queensland had a daughter like we've got she wouldn't be in the position she's in because she couldn't be she would be like us I have no choice I would definitely give my kids cameras all before chemotherapy if my child had epileptic fits or anything that would relieve it with medical cannabis I would definitely give it to him I would try medical cannabis if it's going to help me go fight a problem in you know I'd rather be healthy I guess I would consider it anything that was at at my disposal from a legal standpoint I myself have used it for medical reasons and have have heard great therapy from her if it was prescribed by a doctor yes yes I would use it if I had a medical issue yet before I did get in a bad way I would definitely try I wouldn't hesitate to Heather yeah I have kids or grandchildren if they needed us and it would help them I want them to have us and I would assist in letting them have it break a law to save a life and a lot of parents are do it and that's why we do it we do it to bring joy to our son we give him quality of life it's my son's best interest that he has this cannabis it gives him days or weeks without seizures you know my son has never ever been seizure free ever even on three to four different medications from the pharmacy local companies so yeah it's not breaking a law to me they break the law by not allowing us to use that first nothing's happening we need to get the word out there and a lot more people need to educate themselves on cannabis medicine and everyone who is using it for medical use don't be afraid of prosecution come out come on come up go even on Facebook tell everyone you're using it don't be scared of prosecution the more people who comes out and tells everyone they're using it I'm sure cannabis would already being legalized by now come out publicly just because of it I know a lot of parents like can't because their circumstances with being a single parent and they're scared yes I've come out to save kids like I look at my son and I couldn't imagine any other person having to deal with that or a child in another body like that hurting that much so yeah I come out to tell people you know I'm not profiting off any of this you know I do get a bit of followers that do help me with my son's organic feeds and help me donate to me to pay pay for these organic foods and you know the Churchill into your life for free for me you know late I've seen my son change and they know it's helping him so they have like it's not that I have to do they know that this is the right thing to do so I come out to other people don't be scared you know you son or your daughter or you felt loved one it's more important and then the law itself having to deal with your spouse dying like you loved one dying like like that's why I come out because I'm watching him die and there's a lot of other out there that could benefit a hundred percent from the cannabis they have to understand that distress that this sort of thing puts puts on a family like it's hard to be in a hospital and watch your child seizuring knowing that they can't stop the seizures under those medications are causing your daughter harm and you have a product that could possibly help but you're not allowed user and that product does no harm here they said to get rid of the oils and I will call the police if if they see it or if I to earth bothers to administer it to her demand June July last year she was intubated or on a respirator twice in a period of three weeks because basically because of the hospital wouldn't allow us to give her the cannabis oil in the hospital it becomes in a way dangerous for her to go to hospital because we can't give her the oil in hospital so we need something now for some people not having a supply means that they'll die for some people means that they'll go back to being in horrific pain and suffering and will have to go back to using their pharmaceutical medications basically for all of them it means they'll go back to suffering again Chase has always been seizuring since birth and my daughter was one and a half and it all happened and I think I'm blessed to have her there's a lot of children aren't like her she's a special kid that one she's really careful caring for a child her brother she always watches him holds his hand she's always watching him seizure so she knows what a seizure looks like she's pretty much of them like a second mom to him she's she's even said to me the other day that she wanted to become a carer because no one else looks after kids like chase as good as she would she's a very she's got a heart of gold I guess like I have no idea what it would be like to watch your brother seizure but I do know is that as a parent and it sucks so I could just imagine her and what she feels and she used to come home from daycare this is that when she was two-and-a-half she's very smart I'm used to come home and says Chase is still alive as you know she he could pass throughout the day but now she's more scared of services taking chase and she'd lock a door now she says that she goes I go like a door so they don't come in and take chase he waits now sometimes he smiles my son literally thrives on this medication thrives on kind of us and heal our family thrives watching him so it just brings us all together and that's why we need it the general public need to stand up and stand up they need to stand up they need to show that they support cannabis they need to stop living in fear that people will find out that they're using cannabis or that they support cannabis we need to start taking that stigma away from it that it's a bad drug that it's a horrible drug and we need to prove that it's not we need to prove that good decent people support cannabis and once we do that then we might start changing the perception and the stigma that surrounds it they're scaring parents which is very unfair our kids need it and our families need it I want them to answer what am I supposed to do who am i hurting and that's the question I say who are we hurting we're not hurting our child not hurting you not hurting anybody else who are we hurting nobody we're helping our child if police came here to arrest me they wouldn't arrest me unless they took my daughter with me because I'm not leaving Katelyn side and if it came down to it I would kill if I had to because my daughter means the world to me I'd move mountains for my daughter I have fought that hard giving my daughter CPR to keep her alive I'm not going to let anyone come in and stop me there's no way in the world my daughter isn't she's got a quality of life she is living proof cannabis medicine works she has been living proof for two years and that's enough the last time I ran out of Canada so I gave her sweeping up 15 minutes how much less was your green seongjo please I need an analyst enjoy but this is just so you this this is a leap from a federal point of view I've spoke to Bill Turner on the phone and their hands are tied it's up to the state yeah I'm not getting anywhere I've met Anastasia pro se twice I'm not getting anywhere well I'll tell you what of it I will I will get in touch with an estate and I'll raise this case for you Raina I will I will I will raise this with our races with the primary user as you say it's the state it is a state issue from a federal point of view we've we've made you know legal for medicinal cannabis to come into the country we've licensed people to grow it in Australia and there will be Australian grown the district has this products available I mean I make the cannabis yeah I'm at the stage the journey home in South Australia got rain and I make it for my daughter I'm a single mother with four kids I shouldn't have to be in that circumstance [Music] so tonic maybe go huh [Music] Bella Bella Bella Bella sweetheart [Music] I wonder why they say its darkest before the dawn [Music] fight or flight angels [Music] illusion a holographic sunshine another finding whereas our party is all around blood-red parties like no one can raise are you the angel of the wind it's fight or flight in the angel of the earth just flip the switch to autopilot [Music] you"
bdnNdaLTiN8,Pauline Hanson speaks on Medicinal Cannabis news in Australia,2017-05-19T08:22:11Z,last week on the floor of Parliament the green smooth the motion to actually allow for any cannabis to come into Australia is it going to be safe for you no guarantees this is why I would not support it I've been wanting medicinal cannabis for Australians since 2013 and since the last orbit I got elected to Parliament I've been working extremely hard to actually get things done and I have achieved so much in a short period of time what the Greens done what they achieved what we're at where we're out at the moment is we have 128 people patients are being prescribed it we've got over 100 doctors that are prescribing as well we are calling the government to increase that to over a thousand which they're going through a training program at the moment the Minister Greg Hunt I had a conference call with him today there's also a member of the TGA and also other medical professionals so we have this talk today so setting up a registrar there's going to be one 800 number that you will be able to phone and get the information doctors can around Australia all they need to do is fill out two forms one for the state government one for the federal government to actually get the medicinal cannabis to describe for you the medicinal cannabis only landed on our shores two weeks ago so they're moving quickly to try and put it in place so you will be able to access it why about it against the Greens is because for your safety for quality product and it's not going to be abused there is also it's the same as if you've got a milk formula for the kids you want the right product you want the real product and that's what I've been fighting for and there's another thing I want to tell you is that here I have from one of the letter from one of the farms they're going to be growing this medicinal cannabis and production and distribution here in Australia they have actually from their parent company in Israel have offered a thousand vials of medicinal cannabis per month free to the surrounding people I have presented that to the Minister this morning I will be sending this letter through to him that you can have a look at it there they're going to consider it I know that it is expensive for Australians that is why if we can get a thousand bars a month free to you until production starts here in Australia that's something I've actually been fighting for so look I'm working extremely hard and I'm doing it to you I've always said you know you know I'm here for your benefit I'm here for you I'm not here to play political games and if the Greens want to work with me we can get so far with this don't play politics it's about doing people's lives
JkYrNJX0LvQ,Medical Marijuana in Australia [with Lawyer Erin Nulty],2017-10-07T18:39:13Z,hello all my name is Aaron Nolte I work at a boutique law firm in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales Australia our firm is called Joplin lawyers I met dr. Patel at the recent health and him innovation Expo in Sydney this year everything to do with medical cannabis and him we're trying to become a specialized law firm in this in this industry so it's a great opportunity to have a chat with dr. Patel today and discuss the legislation that he's currently in force in Australia so thank you so much for being on the show and I'm actually just gonna dive right in the first thing is recently there were a lot of changes legally when it comes to medical marijuana in Australia so could you just give the viewers a brief update on what exactly happened alrighty so last year 2016 there have been some developments to our narcotics act and also our international law standards so the legalization of cannabis for medicinal purposes was was made legalized through the amendments of this narcotics Act only for the purposes of medicine for medicinal and scientific purposes so conducting these clinical trials on patients to come up with some kind of therapeutic medicine with the use of cannabis for these patients who are suffering from terminally ill illnesses um this obviously meant changes to our import laws I guess what everybody needs to understand about Australia is that we our legal system is run by a federal and a state based system and sometimes there is some inconsistency between the federal laws and the state laws yeah so you familiar now in relation to the legalization of cannabis and also the introduction of industrial hem um that's that's what we're seeing now we're seeing so much inconsistency between the state and the federal laws which is sending people in a bit of a you know the sending people frantic they just don't know where they stand in relation to this okay so with the import laws so the amendments to the import laws allows for approved importers to buy this medication from overseas providers and store it in Australia for immediate distribution until the domestic production meets local needs those are mixed yeah those amendment also allow for the cultivation of cannabis in Australia for medicinal purposes and scientific purposes only in no way is it legalized in any state or even at a federal level for recreational use we still haven't got to that level yet okay from what I on this America in some states over there have got to that level but Australia is very much like in behind there um so it then falls on the state legislation to make some make some new legislation new laws and to position and criminal and criminal charges there so that's where we're seeing the inconsistency because even though we've got these laws that say people can use it for medicinal purposes if they're caught with it in their possession they could actually face criminal charges okay so that's that a state level though so it's been it's been it's been passed at the federal level for medical use but it has not been passed at the state level is that right well see there's some inconsistency there as well because I mistake have a liaise us particularly New South Wales we have a layout for the use of for patients to use medicinal medicinal cannabis have been under a registered scheme okay and that where people are not understanding where Australia stands me because there's just so many stringent conditions patients and doctors have to me to be able to be eligible to actually take part in this scheme okay so could you walk us through what what those eligibility criteria are both from the physicians end of it and from the patients end of it okay so in New South Wales a wall sorry this is at a federal level as well so patients can be eligible to get access to medicinal marijuana I'm through Pacific Pacific patient groups can under medical supervision have access now this phase for patient access if the doctor is of the opinion that they should qualify as a patient for the use of medicinal cannabis okay um one is the our special access scheme if they fit into category eight this is known as the notification pathway this can only be accessed by medical practitioners for patients who are seriously ill with a condition from which death is a reasonable reasonably likely to occur okay ah only a doctor or a physician who who is eligible or who is eligible to become an authorized prescriber as they call it program can can apply to have an import license for import our permission to be able to then distribute to their patients okay gotcha okay and yes so that seems pretty stringent that I mean it seems like you have to be near death to be eligible to access medical marijuana yeah that's right and we've also got category B if you do not fall within category a under the special access scheme now that's where approval must be sought from out there apart from the therapeutic hood forged under the Therapeutic Goods act and again the doctor must become an authorized subscriber here and then so many are thresholds that are required to be to be met here they must be training and have expertise appropriate for the condition that's being treated but they must to determine the needs of their patient and then monitor the outcome of that therapy okay so what people need to know is that those who are wanting these kind of status need to be really aware of what the import laws are surrounding this and like I said because of the inconsistency between federal and state laws it's really important that whoever wants to become a registered user under this scheme or an author or a doctor who wants to become an authorized subscriber it's really important that they seek legal advice as to the application process and the import laws and regulations under both federal and state laws just to ensure that there's no legal ramification for their actions okay now does a loss specify what form of marijuana the patient can use I mean can they only inhale it can they ingest it there's many different ways to consume it um our legislation doesn't put any kind of restriction as such on there i'm not i'm i guess that would then fall onto the doctor to assess what what would be best for their patient and what kind of yet what kind of way to use the cannabis to best help their patient there that that would fall that that would fall onto the doctor to make that decision okay and we're finding that a lot of doctors don't actually want to become authorized subscribers because there's so many liability issues surrounding nice okay hurry um and it seems like they have to be you can't just be a general practitioner you have to be a specialist it's better to be eligible to be an authorized prescriber yes yes that's right so you really have to show on your datian in some kind of specialized area of Medicine prepare and you really need to specialize in what kind of condition that your patient has in order to in order to apply for this footage import license now again it's important to to know that there are so many different regulations about supplies storage destruction and Records so all of which patients and doctors have to be aware of okay now you walked us through the rules or regulations in New South Wales but what about the other states um as far as I understand it Victoria and Queensland far more progressed than New South Wales Victoria and Queensland actually had a distribution a system where pharmacists can actually distribute to patients who have been given a prescription to to receive the cannabis for medicinal use mm-hmm and one other thing that I will just mention about New South Wales I think it's really important here is that we have we do have a current bill that's that's in our New South Wales Parliament right now which is trying to allow for the registration of medicinal users and carers so what then it would do is introduce this term known as lawful supply and it aims at protecting users and carrots from this criminal liability because like I said state laws are still a still really inconsistent and they're still saying that possession even for medicinal purposes is illegal so it's really important that our governments are hit the nail on the head there and in start developing some some laws that that that help arm the patients and the carers reduce their criminal liability here and this is what our bill is trying to do okay all right and and it seems like in you said in Victoria and in Queensland is there sort of has has marijuana been decriminalized there or are there some repercussions for medicinal purposes yes okay sorry and they do have schemes and New South Wales as well has introduced guidelines in particular for police officers to assist them in determining how do you think how best to use their discretion and to not charge adults and carers who contact with the criminal justice system and that's what's going on in Victoria and Queensland as well okay now you talked about this whole concept of importing why is Australia need to import at this point in time um because there hasn't there there hasn't been many licenses approved for for people to cultivate cannabis um you know the like the licences are increasing for industrial hemp but in relation to cultivating cannabis because of these stringent conditions that need to be met when you apply you have to lessen they're still finding that we still need to import these these materials to to give to give our patients over here access okay got it now does rush so obviously it seems like Australia does make a distinction between hemp and cannabis what what is Australia's stamps on the medical use of hemp because that does have some medical value especially the CBD that's derived from him well save a day oiling in particular it only can only be used only topically so looking at this in time you can't orally take CBD oil okay that's what again some some further and further negotiations are happening in our Parliament to try and get that to get that approved so that's the next step industrial hemp was become wise it's just been legalized in food so that's why you're seeing this great big first of companies wanting to use hemp seed oil and actually producing hemp seeds for food yeah and you're getting protein powders and and like this making hemp flour now yeah this is it's it's it's slowly becoming more aware in Australia it's just significantly lagging behind compared to the states and canada right conditionally okay all right got it um okay so so and then also I mean you answered my question in terms of patients accessing medical marijuana it seems like it differs from state to state some states it's available through a pharmacy and some states is directly available through the physician him or herself so okay awesome um you know that pretty much answers all my questions and questions that my viewers have had is there any other other information you'd like to share with us at this current stage naari because it doesn't our Parliament's don't seem to be really fast tracking these so everything even though they they build and they legislate this legislation came in in some states last year and in some states earlier on this year there really hasn't been any more progress that I can update everybody on because our Parliament's just don't seem to be you know putting putting their putting their put on on the Go button yeah yeah okay all right well maybe we'll meet again when there has been progress made so that would be great um but otherwise um if anybody has any questions for you what's the best way to go about contacting you um you can contact me by email directly I I can send dr. Patel my email address and everybody can get in contact with me that way sure ours and and yeah I think I think that's the best if not after I'll just send through all my phone and details as well because like like you said doctor you're having you're having people inquire from Australia anyways I'll give all Sinn féin through all my contact details and you can pass them on to your patients okay perfect and I thank you for your time for answering these questions for the viewers I'm sure they appreciate it thank you second
G8RCGcyG-a4,Medical cannabis for cancer care: current research in Australia,2017-10-27T00:09:40Z,"folks welcome thank you for joining us this afternoon my name is Terrence Levin my role as director of education and research the Cancer Council WI this is the latest in the cancer update series which we've been now doing for more than 20 years it's our opportunity to bring people to Perth all local experts to identify a topic that's of importance when it comes to cancer in its various forms and various ways in which we look at and tackle cancer whether it's a prevention early detection diagnosis treatment after care and even palliative care so it is the important opportunity for us to bring to the people of Western Australia to the health professionals of Western Australia the latest and up-to-date information on the many topics that arise in the complexities of tackling cancer today I'm delighted to be able to introduce their latest speaker in this series associate professor Emerson who some of you may have heard on radio this morning both I have a say in 6pr we're talking about the current research being undertaken in Australia including research he's leading in here medical cannabis and the evidence for cancer and palliative care in Australia associate professor Grimson is currently a staff specialist in medical oncology at Chris O'Brien lighthouse lifehouse in Sydney he's visiting medical officer abroad Prince Alfred hospital and dubber Base Hospital and a clinical associate professor at the University of Sydney he's leading the world's first medical cannabis trial to treat patients suffering chemotherapy induced nausea and his report is the proud of the trial is making good progress and you hear more of that detail it's political worker folks on testicular cancer with genitourinary cancers and upper gastrointestinal cancers of interest as well he's committed to teaching through the University of Sydney medical program basic physicians training and advanced training in medical oncology and he's accredited RAC a clinical examiner before the presentation begins a couple of housekeeping things I asked you grab your mobile phones and this is a point where I'm always reminded not dig around and find mine and do the same thing make sure it doesn't go off tour is embarrassing your mind does and you might be the same so either switch it to silent or turn it off whichever you prefer I'll also let you know that Petter be speaking for about 40 or 45 minutes there will be time for questions at the end so I encourage you to hold your questions until the end when we do do the questions we running around with the microphone the reason for that is we're recording the event so we record these talks for those who aren't able to make it we then put them on our website so people can access them at a later date and that means if you're going to ask a question we are keen to capture those on that recording so that's the background that's the story that to start applying the rules and I ask you to welcome associate professor professor peter gatien well thanks Terry very much for that very kind introduction I'm really pleased to he be here today and thank you both for putting on such beautiful weather today I did get to walk along this one River this morning what a beautiful cities thank you so I'm just really curious about the audience on delighted you all here you can just indicate by hand only if you feel comfortable but if you'd like to raise your hand you Father you have suffered from cancer or a carer for a cancer patient or have it have close experience if they're okay and also raise your hand if you are interested in using medical cannabis perhaps for your self or for a loved one or have used it done not asking what you did at university in the 60s but but just from a medical point view of you said number of people raising their hands a lot of my focus is going to be on research and trials who has been involved in a clinical trial or had a care or cared for someone or a loved one in a trial this number of people they're great so just by personal introduction you've heard from Terry already that I'm a cancer specialist based the Christian life House cancer hospital in Cydia it's an integrated Cancer Center we treat many patients but we have a lot of interests in clinical research and trials we also have a lot of interest in supportive care and alternative treatments but where we don't have quite quality evidence to try to to generate that evidence to say which supportive or alternative treatments help but also which ones may not help or have side effects I've got involved in research doing a PhD about quality of life assessment in clinical trials and really you know learning how important quality of life is in people with cancer but also learning about how to do high quality trials which is quite challenging I conduct national international clinical trials particularly in testicular cancer and the way I came to cannabis was not from you know an initial being can be I wasn't convicted that medical cannabis would help everyone that I became involved during a trial of an anti-nausea medication for young men with testicular cancer having chemotherapy and then through that was approached by New South Wales health to look at whether medical cannabis helps people with chemotherapy to prevent nausea so I'm chairing strictly not the first but the largest clinical trial looking at that you've heard I'm also an educator but I'm also a member of the pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and they provide advice to Australian Government on medicines to be funded by the PBS and I think one of the real learning from that role is that the only way we can get medicines that help people to be funded is to have very high quality evidence anecdotes and reports and your experiences are useful but that's never going to convince the government to fund a drug what I'm going to cover today I will spend some time talking about clinical research and clinical trials and how that will be important I want to talk about the history of cannabis as a medicine for cancer talk about what medicinal cannabis is and what we know about it for cancer care also talk about some current and planned research about medical cannabis in Australia and some barriers and solutions to its use for cancer care so a number of people have said they've been involved in clinical trials clinical research is about people are not theoretical laboratory studies patients former patients people who are well our particular interest is answering a question about disease and treatment for cannabis clinical research might involve patient contact and follow-up medical records blood or tissue samples scans attitudes and perceptions it can be done by looking back or following forward and following forwards very important for high quality research so looking back or retrospective you can have a case report or an anecdote particular patients seem to have a great benefit from a treatment could be cannabis to relieve nausea or to perhaps hopefully control or cancer but what you don't learn from a case report is well how many people did it help was that person the lucky one in a hundred or perhaps there was something else so we're taking that actually helped them perhaps there were 99 people where it didn't help or had terrible side effects maybe that's not true maybe 99 in a hundred people will benefit but that's what we don't know doing a case series a series of patients is a little bit more useful if a number of people benefit had perhaps you're more confident it will help but it's still subject to bias people tend to only remember that successes and generally will ignore the failures so doing research looking forward or prospectively is much more use our cohort study will follow a group of people over time you don't control what treatment they have but looking forward is less susceptible to that recall bias but doing a clinical trial or even better a combination of clinical trials gives the highest evidence so a clinical trial it's a study that tests ways of improving health in people it's really about bringing treatments from the laboratory to the to the people and in medicine it's really how all potential medical advances are tried tested and proven now clinical trials need to ask three questions how store the new treatment be given and for medical cannabis should it be given vaporized or smoked should it be an oil or a capsule what sort of dose how often once you work that out you need to say well does the new treatment seem to work and then finally the most important thing is the new treatment better than the best current treatment we have available it may be useful to say it helped a particular person but perhaps there's a different medication that works better or less side effects and a separate and different trial is needed to answer each question so we've got phase 1 2 & 3 trials answering each question so phase 1 trial how should a new treatment be given this is the first study that involves people again so it's looking at how often to give a drug how to be given in what dose is it feasible and safe it might only have 10 or 30 participants everyone receives a study treatment and in cancer tend to be for any time kind of cancer who've already had all proven treatments this only provides preliminary information but I'll talk later about a trial being conducted in New South Wales of phase 1 trial of a vaporized cannabis to help boost appetite in end-stage cancer next is to do a phase 2 trial does the new treatment seem to work you'll still learn more about side-effects that they're getting a sense of the activity you might have 30 or a hundred patients typically everyone receives the study treatment at the same dose and regime you've already learned how to give it again as she had all proven and importantly a phase to control trial it may provide sufficient information to actually make a drug available for use in patients the therapeutics good Administration which regulates which drugs can be prescribed by doctors will consider this state health department's might be more willing to approve a drug in that situation but also for guidelines hospital drug committees and individual doctors may be convinced from information from a phase 2 trial that that this particular drug whether it's a conventional drug or medical cannabis could help and then the ultimate trial is a phase 3 trial is the new treatment better than the current treatment it could look at whether people live longer stops the cancer comings back improves quality of life has more or less side effects and this could take hundreds or thousands of patients I'll talk about the trial I'm leading a phase 3 trial of cannabis for nausea chemotherapy and people get randomized so they don't get to choose whether they get the current or the new treatment and that eliminates Briers perhaps someone chooses the treatment for a different reason that will influence the result this is very beneficial to support use in patients in Phase three trials that are positive often will allow government's guidelines hospital doctors to be confident to prescribe a treatment but a phase three trials also usually needed for funding approval through the PPS so why are clinical trial important I think I've told you they give you the most reliable information about benefits and side-effects this is a standard thing for medicine how we adopt new treatments but ultimately a trial could improve treatment and care for all rather than just a small group of people interested in a particular treatment whether it be cannabis or something else if we can prove it's safe and effective and perhaps all patients who would benefit can access it there's also a benefit people people actually being involved in a clinical trial a number of people have said they have been involved and being involved in a trial gives you earlier access to the newest advances being in a trial you get extra support from trial staff more frequent monitoring and follow-up and on average people in a trial do better than those not in the trial because the doctors the nurses have to give the very best treatment and the follow-up so just taking a little bit of a turn coming back to medicinal cannabis this is what you're all here to learn about so this cannabis has been used for thousands of years on the left is a recreation of the Siberian ice maiden who was felt to be a person who in the fifth century BC was suffering from advanced breast cancer and was found in an ice cave not particularly long ago and the interesting thing they were clutching a pouch of what was thought to be cannabis the Eagle lives in the room we'll see the red circle showing that and it's been postulated that this person may have been using cannabis to relieve cancer symptoms perhaps pain or nausea or boost appetite maybe though hoping it would control the cancer as well how cannabis been used as a traditional Indian medicine for many years and O'Shaughnessy apologies for the pronunciation was a British physician working in India who actually introduced this cannabis into the UK and in the late 19th century was being used particularly for pain boost appetite as an anti-seizure medication you see on the right there's a tincture of cannabis interestingly manufactured by a pharmaceutical company called Lillie so they were producing cannabis at that time but then cannabis fell out of favor in that the 1930s part of it was because of prohibition and it was removed from the pharmacopoeia but I think there's some other important reasons cannabis fell out of favour one was plant material was too variable the shelf life was short and unpredictable but importantly I think this drug was replaced as pure opiates morphine and related drugs and more reliable synthetic drugs became available so I think as the pharmaceutical drugs became better and more reliable cannabis which was quite unregulated unpredictable fell out of so I think for medicinal cannabis to come back we need to address some of those issues so there has been a resurgence in interest in cannabis as a treatment for cancer over the last 20 years research interestingly particularly in Israel which discovered the body's natural production of cannabinoids and the effects on the nervous system immune system and gut there's something called endocannabinoids so it's obviously you know cannabis words in humans because the human body produces it naturally it's not quite clear what the natural role of cannabinoids is a lot of it may be as a pain modulator but we're still learning about that um synthetic THC so manufactured was developed in the 1980s it's available in USA not really very available in Australia one called dronabinol on the left and another the brand name called Marinol on the right and this was actually advertised as a treatment to boost appetite so loss of appetite or anorexia in people with weight loss due to AIDS it was approved for that role but also approved to prevent nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy but not particularly well tolerated high THC can make people dizzy disorientated stoned and certainly not commonly used these days with newer anti-nausea medications there's also been a huge amount of community loving around the world that has led to partial decriminalization of cannabis as I said lots of anecdotes so personal experience of people who felt they benefited from cannabis and some limited research showing a benefit interestingly California sort of led the non medical model of medical cannabis which is essentially you go and see your doctor you say you have a approved criteria perhaps a pain or a headache or psoriasis rash and you get a permit to say yes you can have medical cannabis and then you can go into a cannabis pharmacopoeia the door opens and there's this amazing array of cannabis products I think one of the limitations of that is that is not always regulated in terms of what products are available you don't always know what the concentrations are if you're not getting the medical cannabis there's not a medical person to give guidance where you have this particular condition perhaps you should have this type of product you should more THC or less of that or something else and another problem is there's not research going on there's no incentive to do research with the non-medical bond model so we're not learning which patients benefit the most New South Wales gave a waiver for you submit of any form of cannabis for people with the terminal illness and an agreement that police would not charge possession in that role that was motivated by the premier Mike Baird at the time those his poor young men and then has them suffering in his 20s with advanced bowel cancer and nothing prevented is nausea due to chemotherapy except for cannabis that made some big changes in New South Wales more recently medical prescription of cannabis is permitted around Australia as of last year but as you'll hear later is not particularly taken up because of a number of barriers has also clinical trials launched in New South Wales in 2015 which I'll talk about so cannabis contains over 400 chemical compounds it's a lot we don't understand the best known one is called THC tetrahydrocannabinol that's responsible for the psychological effects it can make people feel stoned dizzy disoriented this can be popular for street cannabis and a lot of the street cannabis produced in Australia has very high levels of THC also often quite unpredictable levels and not particularly suited for a medical approach something else called cannabidiol or CBD can reduce a psychologic effects of THC so that can be useful but also reduce anxiety and pain and an anti-seizure medication and the effect on the nerves as an anti-seizure probably helps with nerve pain in two cannabis doesn't readily dissolve in water that's why you can't have a tablet that's why orioles are so popular or vaporized to smoke cannabis but there's many other types of compounds and we're still learning about so what is medical cannabis or the Therapeutic Goods Administration has a technical definition it needs to contain a minimal amount of THC or cannabinoid only coming from the cannabis plant needs to be identifiable plant consistent ingredients in strength known activity in the body and no side effects now ironically about this to the best of my knowledge there's nothing available in Australia that is both TGA approved widely available this is a big limitation to use some medicinal cannabis has a spray form Kona big so Mazal Sativex that is approved but not distributed there's many other products that people are importing or being manufactured in Australia but no to my knowledge no medical cannabis company have actually gone to the effort to generate research about safety and benefit gone through that huge process to the Therapeutic Goods Administration to get it approved so it can be widely available so means doctors have to go through a lot of paperwork to get that approved synthetic products tend not to be popular in Australia that's one approach during a banal or novel oh there's lots of other synthetic cannabis on the street used for other reasons but most medicinal cannabis products are plant-based come from that cannabis sativa plant one way is to inhale it traditionally smoked which is not really appropriate way to take cannabis in a medical setting but a vaporized form would involve taking some leaf putting it in a cylinder it heats the cannabis without burning it and in a vaporized form that you inhale a good thing about inhaling cannabis is that onset is very quick so perhaps for severe acute pain it's useful but it doesn't last very long so not so useful for chronic pain or nausea I mentioned a mouth spray corner big so moles or sound effects interestingly approved for multiple sclerosis too spasticity or stiffness and that contains THC and CBD in equal amounts more popular in the medical setting there's ingested forms of medical cannabis cannabis oil you can see on the right drops capsules which has been used in our trial they take longer to be absorbed but the duration is longer which is helpful and you can customize how much of each product you want so how could medical cannabis help people with cancer well I think probably the big focus is on relieving symptoms and improving quality of life I'll talk about the best evidence is to prevent nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy but stimulating appetite and weight gain and relieving pain I'll also help about the hope it will control or cure cancer that I think it would be naive to think that medical cannabis will cure all cancer we know from research over many years as many different types of cancer they all respond to different treatments so I think let's do some research and find out what types of cancers perhaps there could be some help to control so what is the current evidence for nausea using medical cannabis this is what's called a systematic review where they combined all the clinical trials we know about there was a statement that cannabis based medicines since may be useful for treating refractory chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting so where other treatments have failed there's a lot of methodological limitations of the research and more research using modern chemotherapy modern anti-nausea drugs needs to be done so the particular problems a lot of early studies using cannabis to prevent chemotherapy nausea use smoked marijuana or oral THC which I've said is not well tolerated only limited benefit quite high side effects so not well tolerated and they didn't use modern anti-nausea medications as a control or very small and underpowered trials and whether or not you do think that is medicinal cannabis helps with nausea obviously the evidence has not been strong enough for governments and doctors to to be convinced that it's worthwhile to prescribe so we've got to fix that barrier somehow for chronic pain another review said there was moderate evidence and medical cannabis can be beneficial for treatment of chronic nerve or cancer pain but again a lot of problems with trials that weren't particularly well conducted and this is a big one so looking over the Internet cannabis cures cancer a poor woman with the terminal brain tumor who refused chemotherapy and cannabis oil was felt to be shrinking the tumor curing cancer in an eight-month old baby lots of lots of anecdotes but again this is not high quality research that will change practice so there is some current evidence the National Institute of Health in America have noticed some laboratory research that cannabinoids could have anti-tumor effects they could kill cells or slow cell growth or prevent tumors growing there are some animal models models suggesting potential effects but very little research into humans there was a very small study in Spain with nine participants where cannabis was directly ejected into brain tumors through a reservoir and was shown to be safe but really not enough information to show was effective and again research needs to be done to answer this question the the downside of cannabis is the potential side effects people feeling dizzy tired drunk difficulty speaking problems with memory overexcited depressed or confused there is a possible long-term risk of addiction or withdrawal cravings this is less than other drugs but still a possible issue and really serious side effects of cannabis fainting and delusions hallucinations suicide changes in pulse rate or blood pressure so it's not a get out of jail card using medicinal cannabis it can cause side effects I've actually had one of my patients a very sad story of a young man with young children with cancer who who chose to use medical cannabis for a number of months and he he was stoned for three months and it's been very little time with his family and then he went on to conventional treatment he was very lucky that the conventional chemotherapy worked and he stopped the cannabis and for him conventional treatment was better and he's spending more time with family doing things much more active so it's just a an illustration that medicinal cannabis is not for everyone we do need to think about the side effects as well as that there's certainly what could be benefit so in the second part of the talk I'd like to talk about some current and planned research into Australia into medical cannabis talk about my trial of nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy the related trial boosting appetite is an advanced cancer but also some plan trials to help people with end-stage cancer and treat brain tumors so my trial is sponsored by the New South Wales government preventing drug-resistant chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting it's conducted through the Chris O'Brien lifehouse the University of Sydney number of other cancer centres around New South Wales funded by New South Wales health when we were designing our trial there was not ready production and many medicinal cannabis in Australia so our drugs being produced by a canadian company called tilray so we certainly felt that nausea and vomiting still is a particular problem with chemotherapy and truth many people having potent intravenous chemotherapy don't have nausea or vomiting our treatments are pretty good but there is still 10 or even up to 40% who still vomit that's obviously awful big impact on their quality of life but harder to vomitings easier to control but suppressing nausea is a bigger problem probably at least half still have significant nausea so we can do better there's some evidence that medicinal cannabis can help for nausea and vomiting but using a preparation with more of that CBD which reduces the psychological effects of THC makes people feel relaxed less anxious is more helpful than just using pure THC we designed our trial based on a preliminary Spanish randomized trial they used the spray form of cannabis and you seem to have an extraordinary effect in using nausea and vomiting on the placebo almost eight out of 10 people had unrelieved nausea vomiting with the spray less than three in 10 people had unrelieved nausea and vomiting and it was well tolerated despite some temporary effects and I think this dramatic effect seemed a little bit too good to be true but we wanted to replicate the trial in a larger group of people to be more reliable using a drug that was available in Australia so our study drug is a capsule containing equal amounts of THC and CBD as I said it's made by tilray and aims to have similar properties to the spray used in the Spanish trial our initial doses of the medicinal cannabis are administered in the chemotherapy suite for obvious reasons we didn't think using a vaporizer or smoked cannabis is really practical in a hospital setting when there's other patients and stuff around and so we're using a capsule form and most patients are used to taking capsules or tablets if it's well tolerated then they continue to take that three times a day for five days after each round of chemotherapy we also allow patients to adjust the dose different people will need more or less cannabis and they can increase the dose to better control nausea or if they're getting side effects they can reduce the dose and patients get daily telephone support as well so this is our pilot what's called a phase 2 trial remember a phase 2 trial shows whether treatment is safe and seems to have activity and it's the technical term is called the randomized crossover design but if I take you through you may end up on the top line and for your first round of chemotherapy you get the medical cannabis remember its THC and CBD you're blinded so that means you don't know which one you're getting but if you do get that the first time then the second round you get a placebo and then after the second round then the patient is asked well which one did you do better which one did you have less nausea but also found my defects manageable so someone who felt let's imagine they really were getting their cannabis in the first cycle someone who's said well in the first round I had no nausea at all which was great I felt a little bit dizzy or disoriented but that was manageable then they would say well I prefer it cycle a and then they would get the same drug in in cycle C and for people who are continuing chemotherapy beyond that then they can get ongoing supply so if they end up that they prefer the active cannabis drug and that can be confirmed by a process called unblinding and they continue to get that supplied by the drug company for their course of chemotherapy there's another group who get the placebo the first time and then get the active cannabis and again they get to choose which one and so this can give very useful information about which drug is better assuming 80 participants who are still recruiting assuming that goes well will then do a definitive what's called a phase 3 trial remember I said that gives the highest quality evidence in 250 patients this is what's called a parallel design so one group get their cannabis all the way through the other group get the placebo all the way through and there's some technical trial reasons why we do it that way it could be if you get cannabis in the first cycle perhaps that has some benefit in the second cycle as well so this is a very pure design to be more convinced about how beneficial medical cannabis is and who can be involved in the trial as I said this is currently recruiting in New South Wales cancer patients aged 18 or over who are having potent intravenous chemotherapy and still getting significant nausea or vomiting despite anti nausea best anti-nausea medications we thought about allowing any people having chemotherapy to go on the trial we thought well they go for people who don't have nausea and vomiting they don't really need an extra drug so let's just focus on the people who do have a need obviously we couldn't have people currently using cannabis because that will confound the results and people involved do need to be having treatment at one of the ten participating cancer hospitals in use south wales who cannot be involved in the trial fortunately trials always have restrictions so we can get pure results who don't get confounded by other problems so for example if someone's having nausea or vomiting because of their cancer affecting their garter of their brain they can't be involved they're having tablet chemotherapy that goes for a long time while having radiation that can cause nausea as well which is a confounder there are some people where we feel that medicinal cannabis is not safe so if someone has unstable heart disease it can make the heart race or affect blood pressure someone has a history of epilepsy or recurrent seizures or know cannabis is sometimes used to prevent epilepsy but there is also a risk who could cause it people who have psychiatric problems such as schizophrenia psychosis personality disorder suicidal thoughts they're at higher risk of getting making them worse or people who have substance addiction as well where their concern they won't be able to stop the last one is very interesting in topical and probably of interest to you that people who are unwilling or unable to refrain from driving operating heavy machinery during study treatment and for 72 hours after the last dose can't be involved in the trial and essentially this is because you're not permitted to be affected by medical cannabis while driving I know in Western Australia like in the eastern states is random drug testing and even someone on a trial if or for another reason having medical cannabis if they get tested and they're positive for cannabis the police may choose not to have any sympathy for their condition so they are at risk of being charged similarly if you're having medical cannabis and you're affected and you have a car accident it could be very significant legal consequences your insurance may not cover you for that so this is an important issue I guess would be nice to do some driving studies which are planned to say sometimes it may be safe to use cannabis while driving in the same way that you can get a waiver for taking morphine if you're not affected when you're driving but that's not the case at the moment so this this has had a big impact on our trial because particularly rural patients need to drive to get on with their life so we're looking for improvements from medical cannabis for complete control of nausea and vomiting we also want to know about overall quality of life if your nausea is better but you completely stone that's probably not a good outcome so we want to look at the both sides is acceptable what are the side effects but also importantly we want to look at costs these drugs do have costs whether a patient or the government is paid but perhaps you can save costs if you avoid going into hospital because of vomiting from chemo that's going to save the government money and looking at cost-effectiveness could potentially allow a drug to be funded in the future so recruiting 330 patients over three and a half years around New South Wales we're well underway in our pilot study we're going to have some preliminary results available next year frustratingly it's probably going to take to 2020 to get the final results it seems a long time away for people who want to have better access now but hopefully I'll convince you by the end of the talk that we do need to go through this process to have high quality evidence and that way if it works it will be available to everyone who needs it so the second trial is also funded by New South Wales health looking at medical cannabis to provide relief to cancer patients in the final stages of life this is an early phase of phase one and Phase two trial and looking at a vaporized form of botanical cannabis flower bud being led by a colleague Mira agar who is based in Liverpool in Sydney and working through the University of New South Wales again funded by New South Wales health with drugs supplied by a Netherlands cannabis manufacturer so the goal is whether medical cannabis can enhance quality of life for people with end-stage advanced cancer particularly by improving appetite you sort of heard of that idea of cannabis giving people the munchies and this is really what what it's about it's actually quite a challenge it's being done in a hospital setting and they had to work very closely with the kitchen staff people when they're there food now so that's been an interesting challenge the other interesting challenge about this I said it's using a vaporized form of cannabis and that's been a real challenge because for this study people need to be in hospital to be closely observed you can imagine vaporizing cannabis suddenly you're giving nurses taxi vouchers to get home from their shifts so so lots lots to learn but the reason for vaporized cannabis you remember I said that a vaporized cannabis will be absorbed very quickly and very rapid onset and if you want to eat now you want to get an effect straightaway so that's why they've chosen that way so 30 participants in the first part of the trial cannabis at different doses finding out what's safe and effective is that actually possible to give is it well tolerated what are the side effects what's the ideal dose how often should it be given the second part of the trial if that's effective will be a highest quality Phase three double-blinded trial does it definitely improve appetite and quality of life without overwhelming side effects so I think I said this is made by Netherlands company it's called the drop in oil vaporized cannabis flower buds so as I said before it involves putting a leaf in a vaporizer that's heated in a cylinder without burning and then you inhale the vapor and this has got lots more THC tetrahydrocannabinol lots less CBD with the idea that the th sees what boosts appetite it's given one hour before meals three times a day generally for seven days so who can be involved this is adults with severe loss of appetite due to advanced cancer that can't be fixed in other ways a need satisfactory heart liver kidney function no significant psychiatric disorder you do need good lungs to breathe in a vapor that's important and no substance addiction again not using cannabis and so New South Wales cancer centres are participating part one is going on at the moment into palliative care units one in Sydney one in Newcastle as I said Hospital inpatients so lots of taxi vouchers part two will take place in the community across New South Wales and because these trials are funded by New South Wales health they've elected to just do the trials in that stain two more trials I'll go through these fairly quickly in the interest of time but there is interest in using a capsule containing medicinal cannabis for treatment of refractory advanced cancer is this being done at the Olivia newton-john Cancer Center which is part of the Austin hospital in Melbourne they're seeking funding but drug supplier will become from an Australian medic medical cannabis producer so this will be a randomized placebo-controlled trial with a hundred participants with advanced cancer who don't have any standard anti cancer treatments and they perhaps they've had or can't benefit from surgery or radiation or chemotherapy they need to be reasonably fit with a reasonable life expectancy and the idea is to prevent overall deterioration in overall health by using medicinal cannabis it will contain the capsule containing THC and CBD in equal amount so fairly similar to the trial I'm involved in that will be taken daily and again you can take more or less depending on side-effects what they'd like to see as I said does medicinal cannabis overall improve quality of life perhaps you need to take less morphine or other painkillers or anti-nausea medications with manageable side effects but also looking at this idea you know does is there a chance that cannabis could reduce the size of tumors or delay cancers growing or extend life as I said I don't think this is going to be the case for all tumors but it'll be interesting to get some high-quality research to give a sensor perhaps there are some tumors where it does help progress hasn't started yet hoping to recruit a hundred patients in Melbourne the final trial again this is are not in progress at the moment is a pilot trial looking at the benefit and safety of medicinal cannabis in patients with brain tumors and this is a commercial trial proposed for use in Australia it'll be a pilot randomized trial for people with regressive brain tumors something the glioma or GBM or glioblastoma multiforme II and for people who having cannabis therapy and looking at adding cannabis oil given at night to that as well and people are either randomized to receive a one type of medical cannabis or perhaps a different type that has more THC in it and they'll be compared to a group of people who choose not to go in the trial and the overall goal is to prevent or delay tumor growth so I think it would be really interesting to see whether it has some evidence of activity so it remains provisional it's a recruitment plan to Prince of Wales Hospital in Renwick in Sydney our professor Charlie T Oh some of you who know is a well known neurosurgeon who's involved in that trial so they're there for trial said I've gone through so just in the last couple of minutes hopefully I've started to convince you of this already but why do we need to do clinical trials of medicinal cannabis for cancer how can this actually you know advance the field I think ultimately we want to improve the lives of people with cancer there's some things who do well there's many things that we don't do well and people with cancer it could certainly have better quality of life and live longer with better treatment I've shown you limited research suggest that medicinal cannabis can help particularly to relieve symptoms perhaps in the lab it says it could have anti-tumor effects there's a huge community demand to make medical cannabis available and that's one of the reasons I became involved in the trial as I said at the start I don't know whether cannabis will help but the community wants to know so let's let's do some high quality research and answer the question I think we have got to remember this huge commercial interest in medical cannabis as well in the u.s. in California and other states this is a multi-billion dollar industry cannabis manufacturers are making a lot of money interestingly states are making a lot of money out of taxes for cannabis as well so we just have to keep that in mind if there's a little bit too much hype about some of that's because we really hope this treatment but maybe there is some commercial interests we need to balance out with the science whether or not you think medical cannabis should be available despite recent legislation in waa and other states and community demand there is at the moment very little use of prescription medical cannabis in Australia I said there's no widely available products registered by the TGA the health department's do have the ability to grant approval but you need an authorized prescriber often a specialist or more someone proven to fail treatments it's quite a cumbersome process with lots of paperwork and I think that's because they want better evidence most doctors are reticent to prescribe medical cannabis at the moment one is lack of education medicinal cannabis is not part of the standard medical education program many are skeptics they're concerned about their reputation doctors may be worried well I'm going to be labeled the chronic pain doctor and I'm going to have a waiting room full of people with chronic pain and perhaps that's not I don't feel I'm skilled to manage that as I said there's a lot of paperwork as well then another issue additional cannabis is not funded it is actually quite expensive to to buy an ongoing basis so if high-quality clinical trials prove that medical cannabis is helpful for cancer this could provide a safe secure supply of cannabis medicine available to all who need it evidence to support approval by the TGA and hopefully cannabis producers will go through that effort and money in time and paperwork together the proof it will give more confidence for state health departments and hospitals to more readily approve the use of medical cannabis but also to give confidence by doctors to prescribe but also for patients to use medicinal cannabis there are a group who are very keen or currently using it but there's also a large group who don't want to use cannabis at the moment and they but they may consider it if it's shown to help and also potentially trials could help this to be funded if it was effective and safe and cost-effective so what have I covered today I know a number of you been involved in Charles already but hopefully others have learned about how we do clinical research and trials how it's helpful a bit about the history of cannabis as a medicine for cancer from the Siberian ice maiden all the way through to research in Israel and recent use with community lobbying to get a sense of what is medicinal cannabis how it is different to what's on the street what we know already about medicinal cannabis for cancer care that it probably has some limited benefit but the the research has lots of gaps in it current and planned research for nausea vomiting boosting appetite brain tumors helping end stage cancer that some barriers but also some loose solutions for use of medicinal cannabis for cancer care and that's the end of my talk so thanks so much for your attention folks I'm sure you'll agree with me that was an extraordinarily helpful and they're accessible run through the evidences that currently stand and some of the challenges before the kind of research and work that Pete is doing we've got about 14 minutes for questions Peter does have to be raced off after this he's got a commitment at two o'clock again we've got a microphone we've got Carly over there with the microphone please hold your questions until it arrives and I'll try and juggle it around I'll ask you to keep your questions brief if you can please Carly's gonna go ahead towards the top there and then perhaps work your way down there's a lady in the middle as well oh hey hi Kristin thank you so much for coming across and sharing your knowledge Damon Hurst is my name my question to you is about the timing of your research which is obviously essential and the reality of the fact that marijuana is obviously available on the street at a lower price than the carton of beer and people who are using it and that's why in America they've gone well you know let's just be little about it and clearly I'm in favor of medical research but um if we look at the global community we live in it's it's overwhelming the support for using marijuana and if you compare it to synthetic opiates for example and the sort of prescription problems and side-effects is it any worse yes so that's a good question so I think there's no doubt there's many people using cannabis in Australia which is not in the medicinal form whether it be for cancer or other indications I suspect a number of people are benefitting from it I think probably a number of people are having side effects as well I know in New South Wales has sort of a a middle ground where there's what was called the terminal illness cannabis scheme now called the compassionate use cannabis scheme where while we're waiting to generate the evidence if someone does have a terminal other serious illness they can register with the government and they have cannabis for their own personal use then they won't be charged with that possession also as I said there's a medical prescribing as well so that is a that that's what's happening in Australia but there's this huge group of people who are not using cannabis at the moment they don't want to buy street cannabis and I think they would want higher quality medicinal cannabis with strong research to show it was effective so it could be used so that's what's happening now but perhaps hopefully with these trials it can be available to everyone who needs it thank you very much for your talk on registered nurse I just found it quite frustrating that the medical fraternity of this country does not get together with other medicos throughout the world there's been research and studies done and you know the doctors here will not accept other countries Charles so we have to wait till 2020 for the end of these trials I'll just find it quite frustrating and quite ridiculous quite frankly that you doctors can't get together and work together and provide the community with good solid treatment thank you yes sir so thanks for your comment and I think certainly learning from experiences in other countries is very important New South Wales health as part of funding these trials have also sponsored a number of symposium had experts to come speak from North America from Israel so trying to to have knowledge and learn from that but I think you also need to remember the research that has been done is not all high quality whether or not you believe it it's this drug is not being prescribed at the moment so I think there is a feeling in Australia that we need to have better research to make it more widely available yeah thanks very much have you talked I was just wondering it's I was looking at statistics in America and they said Australia starting to follow suit with opioids than that I think it's like 142 people a day dying from them and when you look at medicinal cannabis I can't I can understand doing the research and doing what users are doing that I can't see the argument in why people can't be using it and while the research is being done because a lot of them people that would be using medicinal cannabis may not be using the opioids and there's a lot of people dying from it but it's happening prescribed all around the world still including in America so I mean it's not gonna harm anyone any more than what the opioids am and they're still being prescribed killing 60,000 people a year in just in the US yes so as I said the government's within Australia both the federal and the state governments have elected to go down a very strict medical model which is quite different to what you've said and I guess there are a number of reasons for that you're certainly welcome to to disagree with it as I said in New South Wales there are other legal ways to access it in the meantime people are choosing to do it outside the law as well that's not something for me as a researcher I can change but that's the grounds that we're working with at the moment I guess I'm trying to help the the medical model to generate the research to actually make it widely available but but but it is a point taken it's very frustrating for people at the moment who want it widely available hi my name is Nina tenets Park I'm a medical researcher but I'm also interested from a personal point of view and I was wondering you mentioned their patient it's been two months stoned while trying the cannabinoid combination therapy do we know enough to be able to play around with the CBD THC ratios at the moment or did you have to follow the the study design and you are not able to adjust this for this father to the most use out of it with the side-effects you know so I think there still needs to be more research to be done in terms of the ratio of THC and CBD but some of the other derivatives or CBD some other compounds within medical cannabis that are probably effective so I don't think we know at the moment what's the most effective I've given you some examples of trials for anti-cancer or specifically for brain tumors in what's proposed and there was a particular trial I mentioned looking at different a higher or lower concentration of THC but the jury's still out - more information than a question I've been making chocolate chip cookies with leaves for two years for chronic pain I'm in my 70s and it works with other things as well with exercise and other drugs but I want to say that it really works I just wish you didn't have the THC effect I take it at night so that and half an hour before I go to bed otherwise I'm unbalanced and I sleep all the way through and it really really helps and I've told all my doctors or my specialists they all know I take it I've never been reported they've been charged or jailed or anything so it goes the only reason that I want me just in the oil is that it takes me seven hours on my feet to make the cookies from start-finish and it really hurts my back you know seven hours on my feet so I really want the oil to come in - I prefer legally yeah but really I would like to get on the front page the West Australian alright thanks very much for you thanks Bill for Canada Western Australia you mentioned the expense of the studies but didn't actually give us any zeros just give us a sense of what a good nausea and vomiting study cost the Australian person over a million dollars thanks just a quick question if and cancer council is supporting they said in terms of funding at all or for future not your trial necessary but if they you know if any grants or any funding through the Cancer Council coming or you well you know how do you fund the safe I wanna good luck yeah so I'm not aware of Cancer Council specifically putting up the hand to fund medical cannabis trowsers said the TransAm involved you know funded by New South Wales health I know the other trials I mentioned they have applied to national bodies such as National Health Medical Research Council on cancer Australia to do funding I think also a number of the cannabis medicinal cannabis manufacturers have expressed interest in both doing and funding trials as well so I think it is going to be a mixture of models both of you know government and commercial from West Australian point of view I can answer that question because one of my responsibilities is administering our research portfolio so we through the donations we received from the people in the community contribute about three and a half to four million dollars a year in cancer research it's a comparative process you'll appreciate that there are many many many many research questions in the cancer field for the most part they are what's called investigator driven that is researchers like Peter apply to us for a process I don't remember maybe corrected one don't remember having seen an application that we've received for specifically research on cannabis they may have been some early career small-scale trials but one of the things we do do is try and identify people like Peter who's doing the research of this kind and bring people like him across to talk about the research that he's doing to pass that information on and in fact just before the talk I mentioned a fear that while he was here he might be able to be in a position to negotiate or talk with researchers here about potentially collaborative research that might commence he's doing I think Grand Rounds at Fiona Stanley Hospital tomorrow morning and so that's it and talking to a group of nearly 200 health professional tonight and so that's how we try and promote and encourage that kind of research to ensure that people are doing the work took the local researchers to ensure there's an opportunity for Western Australian researchers to get involved and participate in that way folks we're just coming up to 1:30 and I don't see lots of other hands up I'll predict something and that is that every time we do a talk like this and people queue up down this aisle in particular to talk to our speaker unfortunately on this okay and most for the most part our speak is happy to take those questions but because of time restrictions today unfortunately we have to whisper Peter away pretty quickly particularly he's going to get a feed of a lunch and so unfortunately we're not going to be able to accommodate that for your individual questions and I know that a lot of people value that opportunity so a couple of things I'll do but before I go to the some of the nuts and bolts things what I'm going to do is ask you to join me a thing before I thought was an excellent"

Australia I'm also the Australian representative for the I am CPC which is the international medical cannabis patients coalition also the Australian lawful use of cannabis Alliance I was on their medical committee way back in the very beginning when this all began in 2014 15 I was on one of the committees for the human rights bill for Queensland but I had to pull out of that when I hope my kidney removed I just got too sick to carry on with it so many things you know just to try and get cannabis legalized you know we've it's been like a chess game the government has put up one block and we've had to counter that block you know whether it be with the press release or with a rally or a workshop the federal election I stood as a state candidate for the drug law Reform Party and two of the two other people who were who are helping John Jenkins he was standing as a candidate in Brisbane for the House of Representatives and another MCA committee member Belinda donor were handing out pamphlets in West End and there was another fellow who is helping though who actually wore a big cannabis hat and Belinda came back to me afterwards and she said Oh Debbie we had people running away from him you know she said they don't want to have anything to do with the with the leaf and she said so we won't be able to use that anymore no no no no no no no no we do the opposite you know we have to make them start to accept it you know there's been prohibition for too long so we started a page called destigmatize the leaf and we organised an event in the Brisbane Botanic Gardens where we actually planted five hundred leaves and and they were all printed with different disease states on them and the media attended and after that we found that people were a little bit more accepting you know they weren't so shocked by seeing a cannabis leaf but that took a lot of hard work on a lot of people's parts to change one little thing like that and that was only in once or group that was exposed to that but that's that's had a flow-on effect because the general community in the last six months I just realized the other day the whole feeling has changed you know there's so much more acceptance and this is why in the background I've been trying to draw attention to the fact that I don't believe there is anything as such thing as recreational use as such it's a distinction that the government make so that we are divided I I first started using cannabis in the late 1980s after I had a spinal injury it was a work-related injury and I subsequently needed to have surgery but during that time I was on lots of painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxants and they had me on rohypnol the date-rape drug up to sleep at nighttime because I wasn't sleeping and when I was up taking two of those that night and I still wasn't sleeping I thought not this is no good I can't just keep throwing these down my throat someone had already recommended cannabis which I had been using to help with the pain and the muscle spasming in my back and I knew that sometimes if I smoked too much when I went to sleep so that's what I started to do I used it to go to sleep over night time and I was having a much better pain-free sleep that way so I continued on with that as time went by I realized that it helped with my post-traumatic stress disorder which I had been treated for even if it wasn't diagnosed I was still treated for anxiety issues since 1977 by a variety of heavy-duty psych medications you know from antidepressants to anti-anxiety medications antipsychotics and in my opinion they actually made me worse they they did horrible things to my head I would get so got upset and I couldn't calm down I would get so angry but I wouldn't get angry at other people I would turn the anger inwards and I would want to kill myself and that's what my kids grew up with and that's not good enough you know and in some ways they think to this day that that's me they don't recognize that it was the medications that were doing that to me and you know like that's had a flow-on effect with the in later years I developed an autoimmune disease and it's rare there's only about 5,000 people in this country that suffer from it there's no cure and it's progressive I'll get progressively worse as time goes by all I can hope for is remission many patients have put on on cancer drugs to try and control it I had exhausted all their treatment options I I did a three-day what they called a prostaglandin infusion in hospital and that was supposed to give me like four or five months relief from the pain and the I have circulation issues due to the nerves actually shut off the circulation in my extremities and each time this happens and and there's nerve damage you know like it does tissue damage and I end up with digital ulcers it's it's similar to frostbite in that the the the tissue becomes deprived of oxygen and just starts to break down and any tiny little injury i shopping bag you know coming from home from the shopping i got a little tiny bruise on the side of my finger and i ended up in hospital with that and i thought they were going to have to amputate my finger but there are so many other parts to it that the the autoimmune disease i have is called Raynaud's phenomenon with limited scleroderma and or it's called systemic sclerosis it's also called scleroderma crest variant because I actually have the crest variant of it and crest actually stands for kalsa gnosis Raynaud's esophageal dysphasia the scleroderma component the rest of them the cowl so notice I can get calcium deposits that can let break through the skin they build up in many people I've had a couple I've been very lucky with them the rhinos is a big problem with me with the circulation being cut off regularly because it's not only triggered by cold it's also triggered by anxiety and this whole cannabis faith has just been one anxious time you know then there's the the esophageal dysphasia which meant that if I swallowed solid food my sole focus would just cramp around it as it went down similar to getting food stuck and it's really painful and it got to the stage where I was living on fluids and now I even had trouble getting fluids down sometimes and the discs were edema now that can affect you in so many ways because that's basically that is your connective tissue is being pumped full of collagen so everything is becoming fibrous and stiff I have the organ involvement with the GI issues I now have some inflammation in a lung so I've got lung involvement now as well as that it's a skin condition as well I have lesions from the top of my head down to my ankles that doctors gave me a prescription after prescription for ointments and creams and steroids and nothing worked and that cannabis appointment does you know so why would I not use that when I'm getting success after years of having these these things all over me then there's the the sclera dactyl II with your fingers becomes stiff and I had when I had the the digital ulcer on this finger the finger started to curl and it is still quite stiff and you can't can no longer or grab any skin on some of my fingers where that become so like the pumped full of collagen but that finger had actually started to curl eventually you know like my fingers will all like claw over as as this becomes worse and worse but I read a study that indicated that cannabis had the potential to rewrite damaged DNA and was an autoimmune disease that was very interesting to me and I did some investigating and I asked some of the experts in the field and they suggested that hemp seed will probably be the best thing to to combat that because it works at a cellular level so I started incorporating bulk amounts of camp seed in my diet and my fingers are straight again they're not a hundred percent but they're functional again you know I got to say I was only using these three you know and they're the index fingers were just kind of sitting there useless because they were so stiff and weren't responsive so that's change so I make sure that I have hemp seed in my diet every day in 2012 the construction industry in Queensland went through a really big slump and end our families business was doing quite badly and we couldn't afford to stay in the house that we were staying in and to be honest we didn't even have enough money to move into another house and over the years we've taken our kids camping you know for six weeks at a time and I'd said to my husband I said you know look don't worry about it we'll just put everything in storage go camping for six weeks like we do anyway and during that time we can save up enough money to you know move into another place which is what we did and while we were over there I stuck myself with a fish hook and got this really weird purple infected mark on my finger and it took quite a while to heal up but it wasn't warm like most infections are it was cold it was really cold and and the doctors couldn't work out what it was after a while it went away but I'd been using the same betadine in a bottle on my finger and I happen to use it on on my foot and the next thing I had these purple marks on my foot and for quite a while I was on antibiotics after antibiotics after antibiotics and it wasn't getting any better in fact it was getting worse and I then ended up with it in my heels and the doctors are scratching their head and eventually I I asked to be referred to an infectious diseases doctor because I thought I must have picked up something really nasty from the rotten bait when I got stuck with the fishhook and he put me on a course of antifungal medications and for six months I was fine but we weren't taking into consideration the weather it had also warmed up so with this condition it settles down during the warmer months it's triggered by cold and at the end of the six months I came off the the fungal medications and it reoccurs so they put me back on the antifungal medications but it didn't get better this time but by that time it was awesome that was starting to cool off and it was actually the cold that was triggering it and it was the infectious diseases doctor said now look it's it can't be ineffective said we have to look further than this I'd been seeing lots of different specialists I was seeing a Rheumatologist because I'd already had trouble with bad trouble with arthritis after half having Ross River fever first and then 12 months later I had a tick bite which although I tested negative to Lyme's disease the rheumatologist believes I did have a a Lyme infection and he believes it because my immune system was under assault for so long it became overactive and it started to attack all of my joints hence the the arthritis so he was treating me with a drug called Plaquenil which made me so itchy I just wanted to tear my skin from my body so it was a case of balance seeing whether the pain was bad enough to tolerate the itching or whether the pain had settled down enough for me to say no I can't stand the itching anymore I've got to stop taking these so it was that in itself was was hard to deal with and then I saw I had my rheumatologist that I was already seeing I had a vascular surgeon that I was already seen because I had a slight vascular issue I was seeing a dermatologist for the skin lesions I was seeing an allergist because I have another condition called aquagenic urticaria which basically is if I get wet with water I break out in hives now that can be tap water fresh water salt water even sweat so I was on high doses of antihistamines for those extremely high doses of antihistamines to control and control what because if I had a shower for instance every night I would be scratching for an hour your own tearing skin off there so seeing analogous for that I was also seeing a gastroenterologist for the spasming issues that I was already having I started going around from one specialist to the other at because at that time I was seeing private specialists and it was costing me hundreds of dollars every visit to go and see them so after one after another basically said I don't know it's not my problem you know it's got nothing to do with what I'm treating before I put off going back to the rheumatologist for quite a while and I didn't go you know make a special trip back to see him because of that I went waited until I needed to see him again and I said oh you know like the infectious diseases doctor had said to speak to you about that and he really matter-of-factly said oh yes will you remember in the very beginning when I told you you had that enzyme and you might develop this and I go all yeah begley he's got all you've got it okay he never ever really explained the symptoms that I would be facing I went into it blind and although he he briefly skirted over here things like all you might get a little bit of thick skin around your around your fingers and around your fingernails and you know you might you might suffer from something like frostbite well I've never mended the snow I don't know what frostbite symptoms are you know it's kind of oh okay it must be really sore you know I was not prepared for number one the severity of the of the condition and the pain but also the speed at which it manifested even the rheumatologist commented on the fact that what had room manifested in two years in me usually took two decades in other people so I was kind of like you know like how much worse is this going to get with a progressive disease how much faster and after I had the injury on the finger and I ended up in hospital and they did the prostaglandin infusion and after that instead of getting symptom relief my symptoms actually increased probably 50 fold was after that that I got the the digital ulcer and I had that for eight months by the end of the eight months I was tearing my hair out I was in so much pain 24 hours a day I wasn't sleeping I wasn't eating very much and the painkillers were just doing my head in and then I don't even know how I found the ncua that I kind of like stumbled on to them on Facebook and I read about cannabis oil and I already knew that I was getting symptom relief with my back from smoking while we're over at Stradbroke we couldn't afford for me to go and get my prescription filled for for all of my um my psych medications and I already knew that the cannabis did calm me down during the periods where I was so upset that I couldn't calm down and I became quite self-destructive it was always cannabis that calmed me down enough that that craziness disappeared you know it it straightened me out basically and calmed me down enough so that I could cope again so I already knew that it worked in that way and I thought well I can't afford to get them I did have access to cannabis that I had grown and I thought well I'm just going to smoke cannabis like I did with the rohypnol because I didn't have smoking the cannabis during the day with the rohypnol and using it at night to go to sleep I didn't have any withdrawal symptoms and I knew that they are very addictive and that the withdrawal symptoms to them should have been horrific and I was kind of like ah this isn't it so hard and then when I went back to my GP he even commented that you know he wouldn't leave me at first he wanted to write me out of prescription yeah a repeat prescription I don't need them he's come but I mean you don't need them I said I'd stop taking them a few weeks ago and he's gone out you see people need normally need pharmaceutical intervention to get off them and I've gone well no and I told him how I gotten off and he was gobsmacked he just couldn't believe it and then so I already knew that without realizing it was medicinal that it did good basically so I thought well that's what I'm going to do this time I had no withdrawal symptoms from the psych drugs and as the next few weeks while we're over at the island played out and I came out of that drug fog I realized that I hadn't been there for a long time I'd been really absent both emotionally and in my connection even to my family it's really difficult to explain where it's like but it's um sometimes it was like just watching everything go on and I realized that the drugs had really been playing havoc with me for you know like 30 over 30 years and that's when I started to have really firm belief in its healing properties and I said the next thing I stumbled on the MCU a when I was in great pain and found out about cannabis oil and it's not that difficult to research how to make it all I had to do was go onto YouTube and follow the directions and from the very first dose of cannabis oil that I made there was significant symptom relief as time went by I was able to refine my treatment methods I started using a cannabis coconut can of coconut oil which was kindly donated to me by Jenny Hallam and then I realized I was putting it into capsules and then I realized one day when I ran out of capsules and I just took it off a spoon that I was getting better symptom relief taking it off the spoon because it was coating the esophagus that went down rather than the capsules gave me some relief but they were bypassing the esophagus and the the capsules weren't melting until low actually in the stomach so you weren't getting as great symptom relief so a lot of a lot of cannabis medicine is trial and error everyone is different all of their treatment methods are going to be different even even people with the same condition may need different treatment methods and then I found that I was able to reduce my dose over a period of time so in the end I was like on a maintenance dose but I still had some niggling GI symptoms which I kept bringing to the attention of the gastroenterologist and they kind of like no I don't know what it is like it could be this and it could be that and we'll see what happens next time so this went on for about three or four visits and then the last trauma said look it's becoming more noticeable and listen I will send you for an ultrasound you know if we find anything we'll call you back for a gastroscopy if we don't find anything we'll just call you back to clinic in six months time okay fine fair enough and during that time I was visiting MP you know the state members of parliament in Queens and and we were going to visit the the committee that there was a certain committee of MPs that was was in dealing with cannabis bill we weren't visited like the majority of down my visited some federal politicians about the cannabis bill myself and Gail Hester spoke in Queensland Parliament on the Queensland cannabis bill I don't know what more we can do they're not listening to patients oh I also I had a meeting with the State Health Minister in Queensland an MP named Peter Russo who is from Sunnybank he was organic organizing a community cabinet and we were invited to apply to have a meeting with the Health Minister which we were granted and while we were waiting to see him because we had a specific time to see him we were able to myself and Belinda donor able to have a few minutes with the Queensland Premier and she said that she supported a round table conference between patients and Queensland Health to try and work through this and this was very early in the piece you know 2015 quite middle of the year so not long into the cannabis fight and you know we're really excited by this you know the Premier's supportive you know we've got a meeting with the Health Minister and we've gone over there and it was horrid he said no cannabis patients what do you mean no no the answer's no and he then went on to basically try and bully me he cited a list of charges I could and would be charged with now I can be sitting across the table from me it was it was designed to be intimidating but all that did was make me angry and I thought no you're playing with my health you obeyed playing with my basic human rights here to effective pain relief and it's made me angry no I'm going to fight this and that's what I've been doing ever since a few weeks ago now I had a very innocuous visit from police on completely different matter to cannabis and they happen to find my plants and subsequent to that they started searching and I told them that I had cannabis oil there and they they took the next three months worth of my medicine they took what plants I had left there that I hadn't yet made into medicine they took all of the ointment that I need for the next three months I have now been charged with producing a dangerous drug possession of a dangerous drug possession of utensils and possession of implements to make dangerous drugs cannabis is not a dangerous drug you can die from cannabis no you can't die from the cannabis overdose not the same as the opiates that they had me on where half the time I was so doped up I didn't even know how many I've had that day you know all I felt was pain I need another pill and I was crazy you know I was sobbing or snapping at people and it's not a way you want to live it's not a way you want to live the last Christmas day that I spent on pharmaceutical medications I didn't even get out of bed my family had Christmas outside while I slept in bed because I was unable to even get up out of bed I was so doped up and it's ridiculous absolutely ridiculous this is just another step in the fight you know they've this time instead of coming after somebody who isn't prepared to stand up and isn't in a situation where they can't care anymore I can't care it's as simple as that this is a bad law and it has to be changed to help people like me and there are thousands and thousands of people like me people who need specific strains to be able to get effective symptom relief and those those combinations of strains you're not going to get from the standardized medicine it's going to be a failure in the long run there are going to be some people who are going to get some relief from it but we're talking about effective medicine available now that the patient's know about the problem is the government and the medical profession haven't caught up with what the patients know and it's because we live it you know we're not just learning it from a book we're not just looking at a screen and going oh okay so that's how it works we're living it every single day so we know immediately this works that doesn't work you know this treatment method works that treatment method doesn't work and we tailor it to ourselves my PTSD smoking is the only way I can keep it under control for a lot of years I thought I cast myself as a recreational smoker because that's what society said I was but in hindsight I wasn't drinking which was a good thing for everyone I'm not a very nice person with with alcohol in me and but I drank because the panic attacks and the social anxiety that I would experience and it wouldn't matter whether there was half a dozen people there or 50 people there it wouldn't matter whether I knew them or not as soon as I walked through the door the panic attacks would start I'd start hyperventilating and I wouldn't be able to calm down and I wouldn't have the the confidence to go up and speak to people so I would go off yeah by myself and sit in a corner somewhere and everybody would think oh you know like you know she she's not very young very social and and that's how I felt but I wasn't physically able to do it but with smoking cannabis in what is supposed to be a recreational way it enabled me to be able to do that to be able to to calm down enough that I was able to have a social interaction with people without feeling like I just wanted to run I didn't want to talk to anybody I just wanted to run we need people to keep contacting their state members even if you've contacted them a hundred times keep contacting them contact them every single day contact your federal members tell them these laws do not serve patients they may serve big business they may look fine on paper and theory but in actual practice they don't work and they're not going to work for us so they need to change the law they need to look at it they need to start speaking to the patient groups and finding out what the consumers actually need instead of saying no this is what we're going to give you and then we're going to take it away and we're going to put up blockages they're like taking away category a which we had to fight to get back you know it's like a game of chess they make one move we have to make another and it's ongoing but this time we need people to start standing up going to rallies we need people on the ground you know it's no good the same two dozen people turning up at every single rally we need all of the people the people who are using it medicinally the people who are using it recreationally the people who believe that what we're doing is right they all need to get off their bums and they need to get to these rallies and show that that the Parliament that this is what the public wants because right now it's all being fought from behind keyboards because the majority of the people fighting this fight are sick and they're all not able to work so they're on low incomes and it is easier for them to fight from behind their keyboard but physically and economically than it is to come down to Brisbane for a rally or get to Canberra for another rally you know we need the people in those areas in the general community to come out and say no you know like these people need this and government are just blocking their way which is what they're doing every step of the way the people in the cannabis community are growing every single day because people are learning for themselves and learning through word of mouth not just from patient groups like us and there are so many ill people out there who do need this that they are going to look further what government and police and the judiciary haven't realized yet is that they missed the tipping point with the with the patients a long time ago patients now would rather be illegally healed than legally dead and more and more and more people are going to stand up and say no more they need to start to work with patient groups it's as simple as that they need to start to listen to their consumers and work with us instead of trying to build a framework that we're just going to reject and we're going to keep going and we will defy and enough is enough [Music]"
e5hrnmJNClg,Medicinal Cannabis,2017-06-15T02:08:39Z,"Mr president, earlier today I sought to
recorded my vote in support of letting terminally ill patients access medical
medicinal cannabis.  I explained to the Senate the reasons why I missed the vote
the first time.  The fact that I was missing was due to miscommunication
between my staff. As a result, I missed the vote and it ended in tie.  My
vote was missing then and it shouldn't have been.  As for the reason why my vote was not recorded for the first time around, it was said that I said one thing
to Buzzfeed at the time and another to the chamber today.  All I have to say to
that is that that it must be the first time a boss has covered for a mistake
made by one of her staff.  If that's my sin, so be it.  But for the Turnbull
government to try to use it as a reason not to let terminally ill people access
what their doctors believe will make their dying days more bearable, then, frankly, that is disgraceful. To attempt to use my comments to a BuzzFeed journalist as
a reason to deny dying people a little dignity and humanity I find it quite
disgusting. I'm just relieved that the Turnbull government's efforts
were unsuccessful. I don't come to this issue in the way that the Greens have come to or in the way that Labor have come to it. I do not approach this issue the way that Derryn
Hinch's Justice Party have approached it, or in the way in which One Nation has
approached it either.  I have considered the issue as somebody who is deeply and
personally concerned about the risks of illicit drugs flooding our streets.  Mr.
President, I've made no secret of the fact that my family has had to deal with
the devastating and destructive effects of illicit drugs.
I have faced criticism for my handling of this sensitive issue and I know that
there are many who wish I hadn't handled I had handled it very differently. But I
can only be honest about my experience and how it affects the way I approach
legislation such as this.  It is hard for me to stand up and support making it
easier for people to access a drug that many people argue is a gateway to
harder more dangerous drugs.  It is hard, because I couldn't support a vote that
would put people's lives at risk. I'm sympathetic to those who worry about
there being slippery slope here. I thought about this issue long and
hard, and realized that if I didn't support the disallowance motion I would
be hurting people, not helping them. I do not believe
this disallowance will open the floodgates I reckon that's rubbish! For huge
quantities of medical cannabis entering the country.  I would be more worried about all
the other stuff that is coming in, quite frankly I think that all it will do
is help make the last few months in the lives of some very sick people a little
more bearable for them.  I wish it could go further;
I wish veterans who are suffering from PTSD could accesses medicinal cannabis if their doctors think it would help them.  I wish that children who are suffering from constant epileptic seizures could access medicinal cannabis if their doctors
think it would help them.  I think there are many people who could benefit from
medicinal cannabis, because this is what all the evidence tells us.  I am in
this place to support decent, fair and humane policy that makes a difference in
people's lives. I'm the last person who would vote for a
motion that opens the floodgates. I voted for this motion because it was a right
thing to do. It is not every day that this place gets
a chance to vote on an issue that will dramatically improve people's quality of
life especially towards the end. Today was one of those rare days and
instead of letting the vote go through, the Turnbull government decided to try
and block it with silly distractions like what was said to a journalist a
month ago.  I hope they are left to think about what they are attempting to do.
They are attempting to block a vote to make what's left of the lives of dying
Australians are little less painful.  A little compassion was all that was asked
to be shown in here.  I can understand if this motion made them nervous.  Nobody has more of a reason to be nervous about the possible effects of this bill than me.  I was
able to put my personal experience aside and vote on the substance of the motion, but they were not able to do the same.  With the support of Labor, One Nation, the Greens and Derryn Hinch's Justice Party, I've recorded my position, I've expressed my
view. And as a result, terminally ill Australians will be able to 
access Medicinal Cannabis in hours, not months.  I'm thankful for the
support of my colleagues and I'm grateful for their vote today."

HSujPXoOtIU,Dr Andrew Katelaris - Australia&#39;s Pot Doctor,2017-08-14T01:07:40Z,as far as we're concerned now we're in the middle of rehashing trials they're doing trials with high-priced pharmaceutical cannabis and a very small number of kids and the police are still very active against the compassionate rowers in this country who are supplying cannabis with a proven track record of effectiveness well I suppose I'd best described as a medical practitioner I've had sort of training in both naturopathic and allopathic medical systems and spent 25 years working mostly in the public health system in pathology and clinical medicine and in forensic pathology my involvement with cannabis is a long one it really grew out in 1988 of the need to find a solution to the logging crisis we're having in this country the old-growth eucalyptus possum magnificent forests and beautiful country was being logged and sold as wood shipped to Japan in my research looking at what else we could do the whole universe of industrial hemp opened up the ability to make houses that are fireproof and termite proof paper without chopping down trees insulation material but doesn't give off poisonous gases the list of endo spent plastics basically we can then conceive of a transition from a hydrocarbon nightmare of which we're now in to a carbohydrate future where we can have high tech we can have very very safe paths that don't rust everyone's seen it on the internet you can make hemp plastic cars with ten times the impact resistance of steel so that whole industrial thing inspired me the medical grew after about 10 years of clinical practice I realized that you don't make people well with end owner oxycontin in fact you usually make their problems worse so I started done supplying cannabis extracts and found I could reduce the need of narcotics in these patients dramatically sometimes down to a quarter or even less than their previous those with better pain control so it seemed like a no-brainer 30 years ago we got access to CBD cannabis in Australia thank you CBD crew and we've spread that around the country and we're seeing the results in terms of childhood epilepsy intractable childhood epilepsy we're having some major successes across the board there and we hope to build on that in the near future well I suppose I should clarify what happened I have been arrested recently it was nowhere near as as serious as people might think it's part of a program that we feel essential we have given up on the possibility that we can negotiate with any of the government state or federal in this country and to conduct those negotiations in your faith I think that's no longer considered a possibility they're unmoved by arguments of compassion and we have to look to strategies to move things forward so what we've done over the last 12 months I've been extracting cannabis generally by sonication into oil for the provision of medical cannabis to sick children but instead of throwing out the leftover leaf we kept it so there's 11 kilos of extracted cannabis leaf which we lift in a grow room publicize its location on TV during a television report and had the police arrived so now we're hoping to or expecting to have a trial by jury where we expect to introduce the concept of jury nullification of statute law and are not guilty finding on the basis of medical necessity so we're very comfortable with using the court as a showcase for the power of medical cannabis and in doing so try and move it's rather backward country forward in that regard concerning medical cannabis in Australia unfortunately there's been more said than actually done the main problem is our progress has been [ __ ] by decisions made by the federal government by Malcolm Turnbull this is a way I interpret the situation two years ago we were happy to support the Greens bill that there'd be an independent office of medical cannabis to oversee the cultivation the production and the distribution of medical cannabis independent of the rest of the pharmaceutical industry but Malcolm Turnbull would not support that bill instead the total control of the development of medical cannabis rollout has been placed under the control of the TGA or the Therapeutic Goods Administration now the only role that the TGA seems to fulfill in this country is to keep the prices of pharmaceuticals high for the enrichment of the pharmaceutical industry rather than the care of the population and that's a really serious allegation that must be made against them I consider a rapid rollout of medical cannabis to be essential for the population health that that will bring there is no doubt now and anyone who says the jury's still out or there's no evidence as living in a bubble somewhere but not in the real world in the real world the list of cannabis responsive conditions continues to grow and the intermediate and longer-term effects of benefit are now being seen as several years of supervised administration has been achieved a our view as to where the future will take it is that in Australia we need a three-tier system of supply the first tier which is a basic human right is home growing and I don't mean a highly supervised restrictive regime but 20 plants per person with no questions asked as long as there's no financial transactions and sales of that material the next tier of supply will be compassionate growth people who are already involved in the provision of compassionate cannabis can take on a number of people five ten thousand people with whatever condition they happen to be interested in and take a close and therapeutic interaction at the proxy level there the herb will be subject to test the purity and potency but no other restrictions at the third level of supply if the allopathic doctors feel they can't prescribe anything other than pharmaceutical grade cannabis which costs over ten times the price of herbal cannabis well then they can use that but the patients can decide whether it's worth paying ten times as much for the doctors in effective cannabis their pharmaceutical cannabis or go down to the hemp embassy or some other place and get your nice herbal cannabis cannabis has a safety profile unique in pharmacology there is nothing that approaches the safety of cannabis across the board so it can be safely treated as a self initiated herbal medicine it doesn't need to be pharmaceutical eyes and that benefits the companies that not the patients and that's not what medicine is about [Music] there is a problem at the moment I'm we had been advocates for several children which have been seized by Family and Community Services in New South Wales and child protection services in Queensland on the most spirit of reasons we have documented cases where the department has repeatedly lied and chillingly they're lying knowing that we have the printed evidence to refute that lie so they're so comfortable in their mouth even and in their evildoing that they don't even bother to hide the fact that we're aware of their lives now these children have been seized from he'll basically incommunicado and to compound the problem as far as I'm concerned the department has taken a Supreme Court order out a million a co-defendant all to prohibit us from even speaking the names of the children that that illegally seized at this stage that's where it's up to where we're disputing that in court but it is a sad indictment of the way the legal system in this country is being used to actually suppress the voices of whistleblowers
AlxPzmN_vwE,Dr Teresa Towpick discussing medicinal cannabis in Australia,2017-10-05T14:26:39Z,well I would like to advise him get out of your office get out of your paperwork stop staring at the computer stop staring her with policies procedures regulation get out and talk to his people talk to them look into their eyes if someone presenting with chronic medical condition and there are so many amazing stories and they take cannabis from legal market can you just go there look into their eyes and tell them look I'm sorry but there's no evidence it's not working you know it's not good for you it can call your calls from brain damage or some other problems can you just say that I think the main thing would be compassion and just cutting out this offices stop creating all of these policies procedures although we don't need structure I understand that's how our society operates but on the other hand compassion is just so sick indigent after all we're doing all of them so for us for our patients and you never know when we can become patients ourselves you never know
NSxLDO0HVpc,Can cannabis ease chemotherapy side effects?,2017-02-04T08:40:53Z,in 2014 al-jazeera filmed Daniel Haslam suffering from bowel cancer his medicines made him too sick to eat only one thing relieved his nausea marijuana at the time the only way he could get it was illegally a dealer sent it in the post in part because of pressure from patients like Haslam several state governments in Australia have begun relaxing the rules surrounding the use of medicinal marijuana the New South Wales government is running separate trials on the treatment of childhood epilepsy terminal illnesses and now the severe nausea caused by the chemotherapy used to treat cancer it's a really exciting trial it's actually going to be the largest trial in the world of medical cannabis for this problem of preventing nausea due to chemotherapy and we're using a novel type of cannabis that we really hope will be well tolerated by patients Mathilde Kabbani Dean wants to be on the trial her studies as a fine art student were put on hold when she was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma a rare form of cancer there's one drug that I can't really leave the house for a week because I'm vomiting the whole time and yeah that's pretty cool Madi it's not very pleasant 80 patients are on the trial if they respond well a 250 patients study will be carried out Daniel Haslam died just months after this interview his legacy may be better treatment for others andrew thomas al jazeera sydney
A9n16WAPPdE,Key barrier to medicinal cannabis is educating Australian doctors of the benefits,2017-03-21T01:31:15Z,laws legalizing medicinal cannabis have seen the prices so-called hot stock companies boom but how do you realistically value companies that are yet to turn a profit or in many cases even put seeds in the ground medical marijuana has been given the green light by the government and now it seems by investors to in the past few months it's become legal in Australia to cultivate manufacture and import medicinal cannabis and many people are trying to cash in on the crop that seemed money poor in with I watering results I think there's a lot of irrational exuberance in the market at the moment the most recent headline-grabbing example is a company called stem cell United it was a three million dollar company specializing in Chinese medicine plant extraction then it announced as it hired a man dubbed the king of cannabis as an advisor shares skyrocketed briefly peaking an evaluation of over 200 million dollars a lot of these companies won't have any our revenues or profits as such so a lot of what's driving the share prices is day traders speculators people following social media and people following announcements put out by the companies that tend to exaggerate their potential it's attracting a diverse group of interest we're seeing all sides miners stem cell companies suddenly to say that they're going to be a marijuana stocks and on the back of that they're able to get capital raisings away which are able to fund cash flow for those businesses for the next few years despite moves to simplify regulation it's still a complicated national picture different states have different rules about what cannabis can be used to treat and for the products to be sold doctors need to prescribe it the key barrier we have at this point in time is really educating Australian books about the potential of these products to give them the confidence to actually start prescribing these this is an area that it's almost impossible to apply valuation too which is why I think it's being fairly a rational pricing prefers as ever investors would be wise to do their due diligence or risk their investment going up in smoke Carrington Clark ABC News

cmEjlMdLi5w,Australia: The Truth About Medical Cannabis! (2017),2017-04-11T13:27:12Z,"Oh Joe do you want me to tell you what how it all started is it I'm CST so I got a call one day asking me to do this story on medical marijuana and I thought okay I've been a reporter for 20 plus years I've seen a lot of human tragedy I've seen unfortunately natural disasters I've seen a lot of death and destruction and I've got to admit that my perceptions around marijuana were not great but I went into this story and I never expected it to change my life as profoundly as it did I went to Tamworth and I met a 24 year old boy Gordon Haslam and he was not your typical 24 year old can you take us back to the day of diagnosis you're only 20 was in Sydney for a festival and a friend called me the doctor said he might have bowel cancer because he noticed a bit of blood and I'd noticed a bit of buddy what am i doing colonoscopy had it and then you know the doctors said we found a large barrel Shema we saw the surgeon here and he said look I don't really think there's anything I can do for Dan and it took a long time to sink him chemo is absolutely awful the town that's poison you get points in there disconcerning your heart he would leave the clinic on the Wednesday he would be as sick as a dog he would need four five days he would lose white his condition would just fall away this is no good for a cancer patient Dan wasn't coping with it very well he wasn't coping with chemotherapy they were calling the chemotherapy or a challenge but they were running out of options an option to combat the nausea was then offered to the family the option was marijuana I was just like everybody else just like the general population and and I thought it was you know a demon drug and it had been vilified for so long but I was desperate it by that stage I thought wow great yep let's do it and what grabbed the public's attention was the support of Dan's dead a retired policeman who headed up drug squads during a 35 year career in the force as soon as he was introduced to a cannabis he had a smoke before he went to the clinic he wasn't sick he had his chemo he came we went out that evening we had steak and eggs that evening can't believe it and I was I smoked that's what we're talking about here it was as close to a miracle as I've ever seen he wouldn't eat normally for at least three days during chemotherapy it was just the opposite and we just all sat and looked at each other in stunned disbelief I still get the side effect yeah I still get the officers and the upset belly and but I'm not sick I don't burn my throat I don't lose weight I don't spend days in hospital so it's changed my life [Music] I think the first time I ever tried to smoke when I finally thought I'd give it a K I'm not lying my massage on fire and I just caught my spider I know everything about it just looks so uncool it's because when we came out publicly in the local paper it was like a domino effect really all of a sudden you'd open the paper and hear a bear story about the local mayor supporting you the deputy mayor all of the councillors then the local police superintendent which was huge yeah the first thing I thought was well you know like surely this can't be that simple I thought you know that there's something that you know both Liu and I prosecuted people for for many many years I had no idea that cannabis could be used for medicinal purposes in the way that I've now learned that a Kimbo and hearing about Dan about Dan's story and that's what changed it for me so changed your perception yeah almost overnight no we're not making this up we're not pulling it out of it out of the sky the backs are doing with any identity yeah absolutely it was like this little ripple effect was getting wider and wider and wider and right at the middle of it was Tamworth which was a really conservative you know very straight kind of conservative country town and what it did was quite extraordinary I'd opened up a huge amount of compassion for the issue but it also opened I think the way for a lot of Australians to finally have some courage to tell their story and one by one we started to see that we started to see this huge picture emerging it wasn't just for pain relief and Dan ended up becoming this unbelievable catalyst for the rest of the nation we're not trying to end the ban on recreational drug use we're just trying to get it treated as medicinally we were considered criminals in our own countries for just trying to care and someone I'm calling or all the other cancer patients and carries that have been email me be strong and help I don't like this I don't like the media attention now we just need some other people to get in there and help me along some started with me you know I don't want to feel like a cook for it and I don't want oh the old cookies up it oncology that it just I don't want to break the law but they're suffering on them to be able to go and treat themselves and help themselves and help their families not watch them just die and suffer there was Dan's story to start with but I think that was the turning point it now was Australia's story really and the story literally took on a life of its own [Music] [Music] what's the difference between cannabis and marijuana well marijuana is really a contrived name cannabis is really the botanical name and marijuana was the name used by the Mexicans and was the name that the Americans stuck to it and indeed they even spelled it two ways they spelled it with the American hm with the Spanish J so there have been ambivalent about it but really as a contrived American name the derives from that period the use of marijuana for medical purposes is not a recent phenomenon its origins date back 5,000 years it was first introduced to Western medicine in 1841 when cannabis resin was successfully used by a physician to treat a child's convulsions and for most of the 1930s American pharmaceutical companies sold extracts of cannabis as medicine until it fell under a blanket of drug prohibition law in the 1920s American physicians wrote three million prescriptions a year that contained cannabis in 1937 they were 28 over-the-counter preparations that contain cannabis and kind of was widely used many clean up until about 68 years ago it fell out of favor he became illegal and fell out of the armamentarium of treatments that doctors have available to them how would you describe the difference between recreational cannabis and medicinal cannabis it's actually simpler than people think recreational cannabis is designed to help people get high a whole bunch of different compounds in the plant cannabis the compound that recreational consumers Chase is tetrahydrocannabinol or delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol or THC the plants which are bred for recreation consumption are either hydroponically grown or indeed genetically bred for THC levels above 20% and this st. the weed that your momma smoked this is a very different product the product that we want has a much higher concentration of CBD and a much lower concentration of THC the product is known as cannabidiol [Music] for the parents of children diagnosed with a chronic form of epilepsy known as intractable it's given cannabis a whole new status as the possible treatment alternative dosha first started getting seizure activity when she was about three and from there just began to spiral out of control to the point we were finding her in unconscious and not breathing in bed [Music] the nighttime seizure was probably most important ones because though the most dangerous she wouldn't have a huge tonic-clonic seizure through the day with that tiny clinics when they're full joking the whole body's moving data's were unique that I wish you wouldn't actually get one of those until she'd fall asleep we've done a trip to Melbourne we had seen professors in Neurology in Sydney we have alarms on her bed we have monitors in the house we had done everything possible you know under conventional medications to see your daughter just slowly regressing all the time was the most heartbreaking thing you know to see things that she used to be able to do and she wasn't doing it and she was either getting brain damage from the epilepsy or she was like a zombie for a mum or the only convulsions no if you and I took the equivalent what she was taking we've been up there for a week we needed an answer and we weren't getting an answer from anything else we've tried so when did you find out about medicinal cannabis ah good old doctor Google and looked at America where they've got a thing called Charlotte's Web Charlotte's Web is a strain of cannabis named after Charlotte Figi from Colorado it's rich in CBD the non psychoactive compound cannabis oil reduced Charlotte's seizures dramatically and her story led to medical marijuana legalization across several US states we had a decision to make either we sit back and do nothing in which deja can you to regress or die or we find an answer for ourselves so we just started running on a low dose of recommendation of just a 1 mil 3 times a day and we built that up over a couple of days but within 3 days we started seeing déjà become come alive you know there was just this personality who started soon coming out and doing things that we hadn't seen for years basically [Music] I bet you can [Music] let's get a bunch of yellow shells [Music] why did I pick one up it [Music] to be honest when it started I was horrified probably as a conservative medical practitioner I thought this is really not good for my patients because that's my primary interest is I want to make my patients better and help them to get better did you want to do this yourself you want me to do it yeah okay all right ready set one two three open are you gonna do it quick what is your medicine exactly wow you're being difficult yeah quick okay good girl don't show me hi good girl high five if we had have had medicinal cannabis three to four years ago the amount of brain damage we would have saved a ship from would have been astronomical you know so other people can save their children from that they need to know about it are you encouraged by her results I'm encouraged by the fact that it certainly helps some of the patients and that's what we have to explore which patients it makes a big difference to but the reality is in the children with these very severe epilepsies often nothing works these doctors have given deixa this diagnosis of you know you're either going to continue to regress or die from this and all of a sudden this miraculous turnaround wouldn't they should or shouldn't they want to know why and investigate that further someone needs to take a stance and see these kids and see the difference that it makes to them into the families look if you want to come and study data come and study Dasia I think the euphoria around the panacea is what makes it so difficult to deal with and the fact that none of the data is filtered so that we don't really see in the media the ten children where didn't work as well as the one child where did the media only is showing us about the good news cases to this day we have had no seizure activity at all and that's just opened up so much for us for Dasia you know she she couldn't read or write before she can their read she can write it's opened up her well it's opened up our world and her brothers and sisters as well what's been the biggest difference getting my Father's Day card she actually wrote me a Father's Day card with happy Father's Day honor love you Dasia and just those little things that mean so much that people take for granted and we didn't have that and there we do [Music] in your time as a specialist have you ever seen anything outside the existing paradigm and medication that's given received this amount of attention no I have not seen any area that I've ever worked in have so much media attention and I've been telling my patients it's trial by media and in fact it's changed the whole equation but I don't feel we have real research studies out double-blind placebo randomised controlled trials we need those and then we will have a clear-cut answer [Music] as a physician if medicinal cannabis becomes available in a way that's different to the current model will have to be the implementers the prescribers for cannabis in this situation and that's terribly important we prescribed safely and effectively and that's where the data are so thin or even lacking the problem probably is that there is not a lot of information that's widely available on this one does have to go digging for us and that's not accidental one has to emphasize that any research into cannabis has been effectively blocked for the last hundred years but research in cannabis in the u.s. remains difficult it's still classified as a Schedule one substance in this category it's both illegal under federal US law and considered to have no value as a therapeutic agent clinical investigations are also hampered by the access to actually obtained research grade cannabis from the National Institute of drug abuse which is subject to rigorous approval processes the National Institute of drug abuse has number one wide and number two distorted the science and number three they don't fund science that shows the medicinal benefit of cannabis the good folk at night in the United States have spent a long time producing studies that merely demonstrate the harmful aspects of cannabis even in the context of blocking good research there's still enough evidence for the use of medical cannabis to advocate for it and what people are angry about is this is basically a harmless substance if your kid is having hundreds of seizures a day like with dravet syndrome and you give them a non psychoactive CBD containing extract and they go from hundreds of seizures a day developmentally disabled to one or two a week one or two a month and our government and I mean our governments are preventing Paris from doing that one of the reasons we're in a mess with medicinal cannabis around the world is that it's been so difficult to get the research done it's been difficult to get funds it's been difficult to get ethics approval and then if you got funds and ethics approval to conduct the research it's all met been almost impossible to get cannabis to actually do the research with not just in Australia but in the United States where most of the medical research in the world has carried out and so this has affected the whole world [Music] one place where research has been quietly carried out for decades is Israel and more specifically Jerusalem [Music] here in Jerusalem you'll find some of the most compelling science about the properties of the cannabis plant and it's largely due to the pioneering work of the man who's come to be known as the godfather of medicinal cannabis professor Raphael Michelin because of his findings this ancient medicinal plant has a new life bravissima shulam began studying cannabis at a time when nobody else in the world was in the early 1960s his start was an unconventional one we got some cannabis from the police five kilos of cannabis they were very nice they broke the laws and we broke the laws he turned out that they were not allowed to give us the the hashish and I was not allowed to take it so if this had happened in the States I would have ended in prison but Israeli the small countries I went to the Ministry of Health who are in charge of these things that said I apologize I won't do it again I'll go through you within months his work was noticed by the world famously he discovered the only psychoactive compound in the plant THC he was also the first scientist to discover what would come to be recognized as another significant compound CBD for almost half a century his work was funded by us grants they never interfered with what I was doing I had to apply of course and tell them what I'm doing and why it's important they never interfere they were very very liberal with the research my lab was doing that's how I was able to do research with cannabis for almost 50 years now morphine was isolated from opium about 200 years ago and cocaine was isolated from coca leaves 150 years previously and yet the structure of the active compound or active compounds in cannabis was not known there were a few others that turned out to be very interesting another one was cannabidiol which is a major one and the compound does not causes any side effects the compound does not have psychoactivity completely innocuous compound if you wish the next step was learning how cannabis reacts to the body's own system and the professor and his team found it was through two cannabinoid receptors in other words our body responds directly to the plant research has dubbed these receptors cb1 and cb2 cb1 receptors are expressed mainly in the brain cb2 receptors mainly in the immune system and people will know about cb2 a lot in the next 20-30 years it's sitting there doing not much but if needed it all of a sudden starts a it's producing much larger amounts and it is a protective mechanism our body collective work on the plant has led to the most significant discovery of all an integral part of our body's physiology known as the endocannabinoid system it turns out that this may be extremely important very important in human disease states do you think the majority of people understand this well I hope that the physicians will understand it so why aren't there clinical trials to support this research well it's very complicated the regulations are such that one needs a lot of backing and there is a lot of background knowledge and a cannabinoid field but when needs also a lot of clinical trials clinical trials cost a lot of money and as the pharma companies are not doing that there is nobody to do it [Music] in Israel we had a change many years ago the Ministry of Health about 10 years ago decided we should go slowly ahead it's resulted in Israel conducting the largest human trials in the world where medicinal cannabis is administered to patients legally dr. B hailed or heads the program I gather together all the prominent physician in Israel asked them to do the homework to examine their evidence and then decide together what is the indication that will allow it to be used doctors are not limited by the diagnosis which means they can treat a wide range of diseases from chronic pain syndromes to digestive ailments basically we're allowed it to treat pain which is symptom not a diagnosis or disease second screening symptoms only oh yes basically those are symptoms those symptoms can be in any disease since the medicinal cannabis program was introduced in 2007 more than 20,000 patients have been treated the program even subsidizes soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder now we know the directions one winter how many more will it be I really don't know forty sixty thousand depends upon the research but the tendency is upwards absolutely [Music] across is well a number of licensed farms have been established to grow specialized strains of cannabis targeting specific ailments from Tourette's syndrome to epilepsy and even neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis the first and the largest of these farms has been set up here in Israel's north it's called tikkun olam in Hebrew it means healing the world and I own same Barberton Muhammad Ahmad jimena 10 was a bet in a bunker Jannetty Kola ganeti coach Alana Burton in southpaw the cholera Bhushan Ignacio Mattel meepo tikkun olam is one of eight government approved farms which produced specialized designer strains of the female cannabis plant it's these plants which contain the medicinal properties of cannabis what we need is to check every plant or every year plantation how much of every ingredient is inside Australia's setup is a remarkable contrast its fertile ground for him one of the world's most durable fibers it's legally grown under license for industrial purposes and doesn't contain THC but medicinal cannabis in Australia is largely illegal and the easiest way of obtaining it is through a black-market one of Australia's most controversial cannabis oil producers to the black market is former doctor Andrew cattle heiress the main reason he was deregistered in 2005 was that he refused to stop recommending and supplying cannabis to patients I've been working with medical cannabis for now 25 years I really became involved because of the failure of the hospital based medicine I was working in a hospital of tertiary referral hospital and became very aware of the shortcomings of the allopathic drugs the opiates and the other drugs used in chronic pain how many children would you estimate that you're currently treating I'm treating about 24 children currently and that's only for lack of material I could certainly multiply that by orders of magnitude if we had more material one of Andrews biggest success stories has been data in some of them it's nothing short of dramatic even if only 30 percent and it's probably at least twice that respond in the way we've seen our best responders that's reason enough right it's unequivocal it has become a life changing medication and you speak from firsthand experience solutely [Music] were you ever scared about getting her the oil at first the thought of it I was like anybody is my daughter gonna get high sure Adele turned to medicinal cannabis when she felt she had run out of treatment options for her daughter Abby diagnosed with a rare neurological condition when she was eight months old we got a diagnosis of cdk or five basically the kids that have the condition can usually never walk talk or feed themselves and they have uncontrolled seizures low muscle tone possible scoliosis most of them are legally blind due to an cortical visual impairment and they didn't know what was going to happen with her how long she had to live you know yeah and then on top the seizures that can take her at any moment as well that was the seizure then a small one yeah that's nothing compared to what they have been how does it feel relying essentially on a black-market horrible at any minute I could run out of her cannabis and potentially loser it shouldn't be that way these kids need this it's not it's not something that we want it's something that she needs to leave if she doesn't have it she more than likely died but even for parents who've had success with the oil their single biggest worry remains being forced to access a product they have no way of identifying I have lots of concerns especially this year where it has become more mainstream and it's more in the media that there are a lot more backyard azan jumping on the bandwagon selling people who are desperate you know some type of well whether they getting the riedel or anything else they don't know and I've heard of cases like that you know I mean been sold canola oil this troubles me greatly the unregulated market that we live in and that patients are being sent cannabis oil but nobody knows which compounds are in it how much THC there isn't it how recently it's been tested it should be on the regular market circle regulated so that it's not on the black market because it's when you have things on the black market that you get the quality control issues it's the quality control issues which have led some parents of children with epilepsy to take matters into their own hands and set up grow rooms in their own homes one frustrated parent recently posted this video filmed in his kitchen instructing parents how to make their own cannabis oil [Music] even so growers say there is still many people who rely on them for help now this is a cannabidiol tincture and a cancer patient would use this for controlling metastasizing cancers or also for bone count service is very very effective this is a sativa mark Heinrich is another cannabis oil producer in demand the majority of people he's contacted by a cancer sufferers how many people would you say you've assisted so far hundreds not just cancer patients but people with serious illness but over the last five years probably it would be well over at the house and that's in the last five years that number is rising it is every day I'm a very emotional when I talk about these cancer patients he'll and they're just beautiful people beautiful people what makes you emotional about that I'm able to do something profound for them that doesn't involve money how many people would you estimate contact you would be at least 100 a week and a lot of people have given up two figures once I've contacted once we don't have a supply of again hundreds now that the knowledge of the therapeutic efficacy of cannabis and not only in epilepsy than a range of other conditions has becoming obvious there is a deluge of people seeking help and this is the only practical way they can actually achieve their health this is Taylor he's eight years old he has uncontrolled epilepsy my son Lindsey age 16 has a brain tumor epilepsy and Asperger's we were told that there was nothing more that could be done medically to treat her seizures he has had a massive reduction in his seizures when he's been in the US on this treatment medicinal cannabis holds significant potential for so many step up Australia these kids deserve better but there are some families who've had to face the consequences of using an illegal substance to treat their child [Music] Kassie and rest baton were inspired to speak out about using the cannabis oil to treat their epileptic son after Dan has limit said his story to a national TV audience but shortly after they were raided by police and their entire supply of cannabis oil seized oil they say was dramatically reducing their son Cooper's seizures it took six months before they were cleared thanks to a change of government and a new Victorian premier who issued an exemption on behalf of the government around the country the raids continue what the political masters have to understand is that a month is a long time for someone with intractable epilepsy a year is an eternity and five years as a death sentence remember they die at a rate of 15% a year one in seven children with intractable epilepsy die as a result of that disease this isn't a disease where the clock stands still it marches on and we have to keep up with that there might be some people out there that perhaps a more cautionary approach to to treating children because it is a gray area in terms of the medicine around it what would you say to them it's only a gray area here and if you look overseas to Israel and other places in Europe and in America they've been doing it for and especially has really been doing for a long long time so it's only a gray area here and there's only been a gray area because they make it a gray area as a medication we don't use it as a drug I look at it as another medicine professor Tali Lerman say gay is the head of pediatric neurology at Wolfson Medical Center at Hollen just south of Tel Aviv it's one of four hospitals in Israel involved in medicinal cannabis trials treating childhood epilepsy there's no parent that I haven't been able to convince that would this would be the right step for their child and I have very Orthodox patients so even in the Orthodox world where you can't even talk about you know marijuana they're ready to give it to their children what we explain to the patients and the parents of course is that the only side effect that we see is drowsiness and it's also only in the beginning and after they get used to it it goes away and that it's not psychoactive it doesn't cause hallucinations it doesn't cause them to be high and it has a medical logic why I been abajo does she appear

night the sages yes but in the day is very good every different kind of seizures I've used it and what I found is that you can't predict you can't say it only works on one kind it can work on any kind of epilepsy or not so we're learning as we go it's not a wonder drug it's none of what is called the magic bullet it doesn't treat all epilepsy I don't want parents to think that this is a cure of their child's epilepsy it's not it works but it works like another medication so I would consider it another medication for epilepsy it should be offered early because it has so little side effects - Oprah - ta-da - Patel Calumet a little shell Levada turn elemental machines do you wish that you'd known about the cannabis earlier Canada might smash of elastic load Cola Topher Jamaica Bella cash let me I'm on a default Levi and I hunger mushaf - Simeon ha Joey Doyle atlatl Fatah regular wish any share liking my cannabis using medications sometimes that have really severe side effects that there are drugs that can harm your liver and have caused the plastic anemia and patients have died of it and we're using them we continue using these medications on these intractable patients there's medications that we give that have caused patients to lose their eyesight and we're still using them so why hesitate using a medication that has relatively no side effects [Music] there's a public debate an important debate about medicinal cannabis certainly I'm advised by the experts many patients who try this this is medicinal cannabis now for pain often find the side effects a real problem you know their mental changes etc they find that a problem and that can be a real issue for people I believe certainly there's an attitude that says that this can't be good because if we're dealing with a substance of abuse and that's a real problem in itself in the case of schizophrenia despite what some people say the jury is not out on this there are reputable researchers who say that there is a clear risk of schizophrenia but there are also others who saying that there isn't a risk or that the risk is very small the reality is that cannabis is a very safe preparation if used him in modest dosage according to a UN report Australians along with the United States and New Zealand are the world's greatest users of cannabis per head of population but one thing is for sure as cannabis consumption has been increasing schizophrenia hasn't been increasing the link between schizophrenia and cannabis use is the most contentious part of the medicinal cannabis debate large volumes of research have been dedicated to the issue over the years and one common conclusion is the frequent use of cannabis between the ages of 15 and 25 could lead to psychosis or an unmasking effect aggravating existing schizophrenia particularly on the developing brain of young males but the evidence is largely based on heavy cannabis abuse over a long period which typically involves high levels of THC medicinal cannabis is generally only administered twice a day and contained to a modest dosage compared to the amount used by a recreational user and they can titrate the right dose for them that is they can workout when they've had enough cannabis to relieve their symptoms but not too much to get unwanted side effects what is interesting about a lot of the evidence regarding the harms of recreational cannabis is that some of the more rigorous and intimidating studies which are true and real come from the last 10 years the last 10 years has seen a very well-documented and well accepted rise in the quantities of THC in the cannabis that's being marketed in recreational cannabis and so one has to assume that you know many of the problems that we're seeing particularly with regards to psychosis are associated with the higher THC strains of cannabis which just wouldn't figure in the treatment of medical problems [Music] cannabidiol is an outstanding compound it is present in cannabis it is very active in a whole list of diseases and it should be administered as such at the moment it is not cannabidiol for some strange reason acts against a huge huge number of diseases most drugs do not act in so many diseases most drugs act on something specific so revered is the professor's work the farmers have named their epilepsy strain after him based on years of his research identifying the compounds of the cannabis plant as much an event possibility a Imam is an EFL the files are had as anima today CBD says la no es la cerveza whose CBD in a bar who's a hot THC shamash

the main patients that we treat a chronic pain that have not been responsive to other medication and have been treated for over two years in a pain clinic and the rest are cancer patients and this treatment is not for the cancer itself it's for the palliative care we teach the patients how to use cannabis and then we choose kind of the variety that we believe that gonna help them it's very important to make them know feel guilty because the using cannabis some of them come here to the consulting and said maybe I will become stone and very worried about drugs but then already use opiate every day and still they're very worried from drugs cannabis and you see I'm a nurse and I'm talking about medical cannabis it's alright you're using is exactly like all the medication that you're gonna found already in your life but it's a flower [Music] one of tikkun alarms patience his elder efrati she suffers from a painful condition known as spinal stenosis a compression of the spinal cord two years of conventional pain medication failed to work so specialists referred her to tikkun olam which then prescribed a preparation higher in THC in Elsa's case only a few inhalations are required the pain relieving effects were almost immediate but it was what happened next that took us by surprise so your wife is dancing now you dancing that's a big difference under agitation she's discrete any table to try oh so you want used to like this another doctor read this another doctor how many medicines is this one two three four five six didn't pitch in medication every day every day every day cannabis ten minutes until it's worth during minute 15 minute not she succeed mission he said it's for me God he said its present for guns that's what we believe present [Music] I can still feel heat I can still feel and then the cold I can steal so the pain most of the body most of my body but I'm paralyzed I can't move from the neck get down only a little bit my head you did eeeh Knopf also traveled a similar path with opiates they proved ineffective after a time and came with unwanted side-effects 24/7 I was thinking about definite it was very difficult to handle with it so I went back to the doctors and I told him that the opiates is nuts and I'm doing so well for me what sort of difference has it made in terms of the pain relief that you experienced on the opiates it's very different because when I used to take the opiates it also it numbs the pain motivated but if you take cannabis makes you happy makes you your appetite you want to go out wanna go to a restaurant meet your friends [Music] two different shades English then you changed before I took the pills in this of the cannabis so so for me it's it's like a different world [Music] a symptom of you Didius paralysis is a spiral reflux which results in uncontrolled tremors about a minute after I take and takes about 15 minutes to feel the fall and it back to the full air after 15 minutes I'm relaxed [Music] come pick up my ham you see you get the difference so you're more loose my body I waited five minutes more money will be fully relaxed [Music] and and the staff the difference if I if I don't take this just a little touching me all my body spasm I shake like this when after I take it you can touch my body I can take a shower relax thing you see [Music] when I was in the accident when I was hit by the car they came me the paramedics and ones pain screaming over there and they gave me move him I was very happy for that now I'm happy more that I can take the cannabis that doesn't make any side effects so I thank God they did they improve that here in Israel and they had this common sense it should come to the receptors that are in the brain you have to take it into your mouth to think about your head and to pass it to your head then it works wonderful [Music] cancer patients on chemotherapy Oh in the terminal states mean everything we can do to help them or enjoy the last days or to overcome chemo therapy side effects you know I see how this in fact can help and in Israel you led the way sure did you have to be courageous to do that no just empathic wasn't a difficult decision for you no I'm not the patient I'm sitting in the right place of the table it's not treating cancer but if a cancer patient who cannot eat who cannot sleep get the cannabis he eats better he sleeps better it improves his whole life so it's not treatment of cancer but it is really really helpful to those patients improving quality of life what is your fly and maybe a little more because if it gets a good nourishment and he sleeps good his whole disease maybe it's progressing less there are some stories emerging around the world anecdotal evidence largely that the cannabis oil is helping to cure cancer here we have the story first of all cancer is not one one disease breast cancer in a woman is not like a prostate cancer in a man two completely different diseases both of them have cancer cancer cells cannabidiol has been shown to be active in both cases in mice never there has never been a clinical trial a large-scale clinical trial with either THC or CBD in any cancer disease period nothing the professor has conducted a small scale clinical trial but not in the area of cancer his study focused on alleviating the symptoms of chemotherapy in young patients so the children will crank all the time they were in a bad shape the parents were in a bad shape and we decided we have to do something and we decided we'll be great scientists will do a clinical trial with children that get the material and children they don't get the material after a week the physician comes to me and I can't do it she says I know exactly who is taking it and I'm exactly who is not those that are taking ice although she is not supposed to know who is taking it I can see five children do not vomit and five children do vomit so she started giving all the children in her department THC she gave it four hundred times and we didn't have a single case of vomiting a single case of nausea completely clean and we published that and nothing happened and when did you publish that twenty years ago the moment the doctors are getting open to that the moment the patient ceded it doesn't harm them and they hear from another patients my treatment was so easy because as they use cannabis they're coming to us so they're hearing anecdotal evidence from one another that is happening once in a while that's not happening once in a while all right so it's gone beyond anecdotal yeah it's clinical observation for you it's really a success [Music] what's it like before and after shaking uncontrollably can't it please anima fork spill my soup down me and afterwards it town me down they're not bacon taken to knitting and sewing again so it really has a noticeable improvement figure first each was victim in a car accident which are seven multiple broken bones including affected scale I take full prescription drugs painkillers yes so you were introduced to cannabis tincture what were you hoping to change we leave my need for the medication and at the moment looks like doing this she's doing everything that they said that she wouldn't do from smiling rolling over holding a head for short periods of time you know body weight Barry that's one thing that they said she'd never do without a standing frame and she did it the other day so it's it's really amazing what she's alive she's not just a body anymore [Music] the worst of the worst of this illness is the pain it's like I can talk about it now because I haven't got it right because now I'm only oil but it's like something hitting a little sledgehammer and now I haven't got a mountain tall enough to stand on to scream to the world um it's giving me the next 20 years has there been merit in the anecdotal evidence presented so far that's a good question ultimately we need to know why don't get all evidence is actually helpful and what isn't and we'll only know that by having these further trials and investigations performed there is some evidence that cannabis can as a supplement reduce pain for some people yes there is some evidence along those lines although I'd like more evidence to help us and to guide us we have over a hundred randomized control trials on medicinal cannabis now I find the evidence overwhelming as Laurie does overwhelming that this is an effective drug for many symptoms certain conditions I am at a loss to understand how some senior doctors senior academics can say there's no evidence that it's effective and that it's highly dangerous frankly I think that's nonsense it would be wonderful if the information available was sufficient already but one of the creditors of a doctor is do no harm and at the moment we don't know for certain that the cannabidiol will not harm the child's brain take the epilepsy example smoking the raw plant of cannabis actually makes epilepsy worse and it's a well-documented you know a fact around neurologists around the world but when we start to look at some of the anecdotal evidence they're looking at the parts of the plant but also the different delivery mechanisms such as vaporizing it or oil-based products which is very different to smoke yes we want to know what can be the best answers in terms of epilepsy though I don't think any of the children do smoke at their doing just the oil themselves so there's a nice exactly right but we know that we need to be smarter about how we approach all of this and get the right answers to get the best outcomes [Music] this is in fact a paradigm shift really for medicine in its entirety because what we're asking ya is to be able to advise an advocate for a product in many cases the crude cannabis product which has not been processed at all which really removes a great deal of control out of the medical professionals hands and that's not somewhere that medical professional people like to be generally speaking so as a doctor or you ever get taught about cannabis you get very little the lieu you do get taught about is cannabis as an illicit drug and the harms associated with cannabis use so there isn't any contemporary medical education around any of the potential therapeutic effects of cannabis so do you believe that more doctors need to be educated about medicinal cannabis well have the moment we need to know what the answers are to it before we start to educate because at the moment is a case of it's an illegal product obtained illegally and people don't have the experience with it with great respect to my colleagues in the AMA the AMA is not a an expert body of forensic people or neuropsychologists or addiction specialists there are trade union and they're there to stand up for us but it doesn't represent a an expert opinion if you like it's an opinion and it's an important one and what's frustrating for me as a doctor is that here is preventable misery and suffering endured by people with serious illnesses endured by their loved ones their families and we can't use all the weapons that are potentially at our disposal to relieve misery and suffering what's wrong with us why can't we do this most physicians open-minded I hope and if there are a few data let know about these things and do not do it just for the profit I mean in the u.s. you have sometimes somebody going from place to place and there are 200 people waiting in line yes sir I have pain here is it $200 next one please that's not the way to do things about medical habits we have the habits we are trained to use only medication that were approved that we know every side-effect dosage specially exact a composition of the drug what's happening with the cannabis we don't have good research the develop a new drug needs a lot of money and the drug companies are not ready to invest not a cent and that may well represent a extraordinary conflict of interest if you accept that Big Pharma has the degree of influence on society that big tobacco and big alcohol does this may be the biggest Rubicon that we need to cross we've got so much faith in what we're doing and the people that are supporting us have got faith in us as well so I got an email a couple of days ago about an Australian woman who moved to America because her young boys got a brain tumor and they've ended up on the oil and his tumors halved in size how do you feel when you hear stories like that like a brain tumor but still it's hope yeah what's enough faith for us but since that's enough evidence for us to just give it all we've got yep [Music] Australian momentum on the medicinal cannabis debate began in earnest with Dan Haslam and within weeks of his story airing his mother Lucy was compelled to coordinate the country's first-ever symposium on medicinal cannabis determined to educate families who may find themselves in a similar position she was backed by the state's premier what was it that moved here about their story you could see the eyes he could see the pain and you could see the the difference there was a determination and assuredness that this was making a difference to them to think be and I know that some will have differences of difference of opinion or I will argue that government's not doing enough for not nestling faster and I say they will continue to us cannabis allows individuals to be independent of the medical system which has largely file them for decades and really we have to live in cannabis as an independent medicine as whatever what I want to share with you are the underpinnings for everything else psyche here you know there's a reason that cannabis works and the reason that it is and it's not simply because somebody said it should be there the patients need to apply with the recommendation of a specialist to the Ministry of Health it's usually the changing attitudes that are going on in the US which are not too dissimilar from the changing attitudes that you've seen here in Australia in the last six months it was amazing and it's just so nice when people come up to you and they're sort of not actually words they just hold your hand and look in your eyes and you know and you can see that there's words that want to come out that won't and you know that that person has got a story and they're just saying thank you with their eyes and there was lots of that it's not about you know which side you're on that working together to help each other it's the best thing so thank you [Applause] there's a real sadness around today last night I got a text telling me that Dan Haslam had died and even though we knew the day was coming it didn't make it any easier dan Haslam was an incredible bloke a lot of people get the chance to change the world but not many people take it but he took it we come here today for a celebration of Dan's short life we were overwhelmed all of us the nation was overwhelmed he sought to alleviate the suffering and pain for those who may be enduring what he was enduring is an extraordinary act of selfless courage [Music] so he told his story and he pushed the government and with his mother Lucy really shook this place up they wanted other people to get the benefit of medicinal cannabis without having to break the law we're here to hug you but most importantly we're here they continue that journey with you the journey has a long way to go and will March March very quickly and and as hard as we possibly can so with hundreds of other people today I'm heartbroken that the cancer finally one but not before Dan Haslam's story was told I will miss him every minute of every hour of every day and in his honor I will continue his legacy to reduce the unnecessary suffering of thousands of fellow Australians thank you [Applause] and Dan's legacy is already a rich one inspired by Lucy's drive to stage a national symposium Australian grandparents of a young girl with epilepsy donated a record 33 point seven million dollars to cannabis research this is ultimately a story about love and hope it's a great day for the University of Sydney it's a great day for the people of Australia and the world more generally on behalf of the state and country thank you this act is something that's going to reverberate around the world and beyond research it's Lucy's hope that the shift will also take place in public perception we've all been hoodwinked I think I feel a bit stupid that I had the attitude that I had that it was so bad and yeah it was there was lack of education and probably for if Dan didn't get sick I wouldn't have had the reason to go and to learn I guess I'm on that journey that so many people go through [Music] how much of this is wrapped up in stigma a lot of it and it requires some something outside the general consensus of the medical profession to trigger people to be willing to look at it and to understand it and understand that there are sensible constraints that can be put in place through regulation that makes it safe I think the death of people my generation and older will be very helpful in removing that stigma well I think the way to come overcome any stigma associated with medical cannabis is to have clear information about when it's beneficial in whom it's beneficial and what conditions is going to help unfortunately we are a conservative profession and we do take ourselves sometimes very seriously sometimes overly seriously in a world where fewer and fewer resources are being devoted to looking after patients and our budgets are being constantly cut back it is important that we earn the respect that has been traditionally afforded to us as doctors and stand up for patients across the board including involving issues that may not be overly palatable to our profession looking back at it now if you had a said to me at the start of this year where our journey would be now you guys say no come on you're joking me you know we wouldn't even think about doing that but at the end of the day you go anywhere do anything for your child you go and get an opiate you know and that's legal but it's lethal and you can give that to a child but yet you can't give something that's non psychoactive and it's not reacting in herds it for making her better I think that's ridiculous what's more dangerous giving your child Prentice own that could give could kill her give her a stroke could have paralysis down one side or glaucoma or kidney failure liver failure or medicinal cannabis and we've had no side effects whatsoever to me it's a no-brainer there's an urgency in an immediacy about it there's none contestability about it I think that means it's something that we could and should and must deal with separately and immediately and hopefully with medical cannabis we can see the error of our ways and we can say actually there are some substances which are off benefit to some people in the community if used in the right setting let's stop blanket probation use any wails there there Dasia in the backdrop of all of this you've had your own personal problems to contend with this year yoga diagnosed with cancer and you know I didn't pick a good one to get so I'm just dealing with it the way I'm dealing with it but my priority is my family and I want my sure things are right for them [Music] you [Music] how do you feel knowing that your son's actions are most likely bringing about an enduring legacy I'm very proud of him but it's just there's not a lot of joy there this is a sad battle really [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]"
ipp2TvQZXP0,Greendorphin World News Episode #1 Australia Cannabis News Featuring Ben Oakley,2017-08-13T00:50:28Z,then Oakley suffers from stiff person syndrome the 21 year old relies on cannabis oil to stop painful spasms - in a bit years I've been on the additional cannabis I've only had three spasms he'd had more than 600 the previous two years but it's still too hard to find a doctor who prescribed the medication in the first place we want to make supply available but it has to be legal it means the seriously ill need to turn to black-market supplies as Ben has done with Jenny Hallam I just want a supply to be available to people who need it that's the most important thing to me the government keeps telling us that medicinal cannabis is available and so people are out there trying to get hold of it but they can't because there is no access so to tell you what I did I basically did what I thought I had to do just to help people try and get through until illegal supply was available like thousands of Australian the Oakley's source their cannabis from the black market Adelaide producer Jenny Hallam was helping them to her home was raided in January I knew exactly what they were there for us and of us autumn walking out as soon as I came to the door I said to them that there was cannabis and cannabis oil on the premises that it was used to treat people that were sick and dying and anything that they took that day could result in somebody says I told them that and they still waters the house and they still till the oil and it has resulted in somebody's death following federal changes last year the state government is trying to make it easier for doctors to prescribe the drugs they are going to move to down slowly now the phone was turned around and said you need to wait it could take 78 months I don't have that many many people have died waiting to access medicinal cannabis there are people that were too scared to break the law and so they were waiting for a legal supply but they didn't have time and they've lost their lives in the meantime people that have decided to use it they're doing so in desperation but are being treated like criminals because of them so but what the government doesn't seem to understand is we only get one life we only get one chance for that so major don't seem to get that if I wasn't to Jenny Collins I wouldn't need for mum and dad thought they're going to have to bury me so Jenny came at the right time and the angel she is save my life could only watch between 10 and 20 seconds of the video before I had to turn it off because it reminded me very much of what I had gone through when I first had my plane condition and I was devastated to see what he was going through so I reached out to his father and said that I had something that I thought it might be able to help some miraculous results almost straightaway and he's just been doing fantastic ever since and is continually getting better this is life-saving it changes people's lives to the better I just don't understand why the politics is is letting it down
o49cfi3rY7Q,One of Australia&#39;s Biggest Ex - Marijuana Plantations,2017-09-04T02:46:49Z,[Music] all right guys now this is really interesting I'm I'm about 30 minutes in off the track why up in the hill and absolutely in the middle of nowhere you still this irrigation here all this pipe that's been run down covertly into the the waters below this whole strip here probably maybe 2 K I suppose up the hill this was Australia's biggest covert marijuana plant plantation there's a lookout up there looking out for helicopters and everything and I was old imagine I had some kind of netting that they would pull over this was busted quite a few years ago but 2004 I think it was and my friend who had the estate next door the moment that these guys were put in prison because they were scumbags they bought all their land to purchase all the land from the government there you go the remnants of an old covert marijuana plantation that was the biggest in Australian history it goes way back there there's these barrels and stuff back there like yeah it's basically the last two miles just been like this you've got to give it to them you got to give it to them I mean the ingenuity to get this set up its I've never touched it in my life but I know there's a lot of Advocates for it and a lot against but you know by the boy I have an opinion either way I'll pick a mantle have one voice either that's beer rule you know maybe Juwanna or whatever you want but yeah all the moderation I suppose yeah imagine the poor bastard that to climb up there all right I'll stick up to the top of this paddock if there's no way out I'll turn around and head back because I'm running low on go-go juice well I guys but I wanted to find this place took a long time to get here no I would what our YouTube it's 9:15 a.m. on Thursday the 20th of July the wind still quite high today but the clouds have gone a beautiful day to go roaming beautiful same setup as yesterday taking out the clock 21 cuz that seemed to work well and also us a bit of fun got the Ruger American and we're gonna be heading into the bush again oh my god you see what we see all right guys it's on the track in I saw one Pig I lean right not very big maybe I don't know maybe live for the torso took off in front of me and go a little bit of a chase there on the bike but yeah he wasn't worth anything but this is interesting we are you remember the other day I told you about the hidden marijuana then from 20-30 years ago back over that way well this was the this is an absolutely separate different part of their Bush setup this is the helicopter pad where the guys from Sydney or Brisbane or wherever would fly in a helicopter and we're quite we're quite a ways up I mean you can see the pigs here guys and you can see the valley why down there we're probably at about 620 630 above sea level at the moment and yeah they used to buzz the bird in here pick up the marijuana and then bugger off but down there is the second drug down in processing where they did all the packaging we're gonna go down and have a look at that afterwards more I have the other tyres have turned once run over by criminals now run by soldiers and well now owned by yeah military people and law enforcement people their loss our gain all good this bit of Rhodesian for you there boys the dougie that will come in and pick up the marriage amana

look around here obviously the federal police have been up here 20 years ago when they like busted the guys that used to own this property and all the pipe work they've cut up and they've taken out all the processing gear but makes you wonder doesn't it you know somewhere out in these mountains and in these hills might be stacks of money hidden in barrels or something I don't know something different though I mean these guys the guys the guy that was put in prison for this he got sentenced to 16 years I think in prison I was told and he's out now and apparently he's reformed and you know these these aren't online bloody cocaine and heroin dealers guys he's a and I'm not condoning it by any stretch of the imagination these are marijuana bloody hippie dudes you know yeah apparently you know they were really lovely people the whole community around here they all knew them and didn't have a clue what they were doing because I had bad on this property they had cows and sheep stuff like

W3y4vU9kuUY,"Medical Cannabis Law Reform Rally and March - Brisbane, Australia",2017-11-15T08:27:28Z,[Music] if we want to talk about the one thing that everybody's had the wool thrown over their eyes about that's that's the ability to be able to access cannabis medicine in Australia it's it's a fallacy it's a complete fallacy there is no such thing as the ability to be able to access cannabis medicine there is no cannabis medicine in Australia whatsoever if anyone asks you it's your job to tell them cannabis is not legal to me or my sick and dying [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hi my name's Katrina dragon a lot of you name is Katrina mostly on Facebook so overthought I can't win right here with 19 medical conditions ranging from refractory epilepsy scoliosis hypertonia play jerk athlete played just personally microcephaly communicating car Kepler's chronic lung disease obstructive sleep apnea with hyperventilation hip dysplasia and the list goes on the three years now I've been fighting to try and get a legal cannabis product for my daughter and I'm going around in circles I get promised everything and nothing's happening back in January Jeanette Young said my daughter can sound the medical products what she's on today she told me it's not an amnesty for my daughter can Salma threee legal cannabis products will she put that in writing for me no she won't then we've got palliative care ladies lento Children's Hospital third preferred ik is my daughter oxy codeine oxycottons and own criminal gabapentin and bursitis patches instead of prescribing cannabis to my child now my daughter's meant to be on these opiates until she's 15 years old and so they can remove her his joints dislocate other hip she's had three keep operations and nothing self so the only thing they can do is we made the whole hip joints but they won't do that until she's 15 so they want mean it drove my daughter up on all these opiates what suppressor breathing put her on high-flow oxygen and have her sedated in bed every day because she's 15 instead of me giving my daughter a drop of cannabis which is accessing the community and has a quality of life unfortunately I'm sure most of us here are aware that little silly passed away not long ago and before I invite Steve up to speak as a mark of respect I'd like us just to have a minute's silence in memory of silly access a legal product for surely the hospital refused to do a prescription we just could not do it nobody would do it I think it's being blocked and but they're being intimidated by higher up they denied but what other reason can there be [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] a great joy to see so many courageous caring compassionate people here who have the courage to stand up against this callous true criminal government who are withholding this natural medicine from the people that need it my name is Sammy I'm another two and I am battling some chronic health conditions for most of my life I've been heavily medicated with strong and addictive pharmaceutical drugs and practically housebound I did not see any value in my life I used to wait for the day my illness would get the better of me and our other lovely lady speakers have touched on the point that the government keep you're running around in circles they don't care they know that cannabis cures they know that they are keeping people sick by keeping it illegal but they're doing this on purpose the worst thing that we're seeing is people passing away without access them not being able to access the medicine in their last days is is something quite quite traumatic obviously if they've been put in hospital they've previously been on the medication and then the medical associations and the people in power are there to tell them no they're not allowed to have those last days with the medicine that's been giving the comfort that has for the last few months of their life so that's that's quite terrifying I also try to negotiate the legal application processes through both my specialists and my GPS and file because these Lords are set up for people not to get medicine this has left me with no other option but to grow my own plants and make my own medicine have it stolen by the stormtroopers to keep my symptoms at bay I'm so angry I'm so sick and tired of this [ __ ] the advice to live forced to live through I'm treated like a common criminal and when I say bring it on I'm over it I mean it and I'm gonna fight these charges not just for me but for every other Queensland patient as well I'll be joined by MC UI Memphis and protesters outside Queensland Health we're only serving false appearance on them today [Applause] [Music] um I will promise that one day we will have legalized cannabis medicine and it's people like yourselves that are standing in front of us that we've got to be thankful for these changes just keep fighting please it's it's more important than you would ever believe every day not to let lose sight of what can be a new future for Australia in in in therapy and thank you for coming today [Applause] [Music] [Music]
TVyOGd6A5V4,&#39;RESET&#39; AUSTRALIA&#39;S MEDICINAL CANNABIS LAWS NOW!,2017-09-04T22:35:12Z,oK we've got some exciting news for people who are in favor of medicinal cannabis I want to introduce Richard Hopkins and and he's going to give you a rundown of our meeting that we arranged with Minister for health Greg Hunt just now 10 o'clock tonight we've just finished Richard yeah I'd like to thank the minister hunt for giving reset medical cannabis regulations are you really thorough hearing and we are very confident that some improvements in the regulatory framework will result from it minister hunt proved to be very knowledgeable on the subject and really cared about the subject he's got his work cut out there with the doctors and some of the pharmacy yes marmoset eagles third list interests that are going to make this difficult but he did say I was delighted that I know Richard works very hard and he's done a lot of good research and colleagues of ours in one nation have congratulated him for his work but Greg hunt himself said that it was seriously good submission that Richard made and it was by far the best research document that anyone had put to Greg hunt on cannabis and that he actually stopped in his tracks and said what have you been doing what's your background so I mean Greg hunt was stunned it literally he was stunned and he was most encouraging wasn't he yes it was and I'd like to thank one nation and Senator Roberts for all their work in helping push this through this is a party that is committed to making legal humane medical cannabis happen in Australia and while we're very encouraged Greg hunt did say he's got to do some more work and he's going to use that document that the documents that Richard has given him and he was very complimentary as I said about the report and so now he was very careful not to say that he it was in the bag but he was now got very good material on which to work so all those hanging out from medicinal cannabis stay tuned thank you very much Richard
mnMfXgBhmJo,Introducing The Australian Medicinal Cannabis Observatory - Associate Professor David Caldicott,2017-07-24T01:58:07Z,"last night after a couple of frothing surveil decided to tell me that he wants me to introduce him today using only information I learned about him last night fortunately for him I can't really remember most of that so I'm going to read the blurb that's here dr. David Cole dekat MD dr. Cole Dakota is the author of a brand new Australian training program for authorized prescribers of medicinal cannabis which will present to us today David has worked as a specialist emergency physician for 25 years he's a senior university lecturer an adjunct associate professor a founding member of the Australian medical cannabis Observatory are created to establish the infrastructure and support systems that an emerging medicinal cannabis industry will require David is the author of numerous publications a researcher educator with specialties in novel illicit compounds in the IDI in the IDI stimulation medical education innovation in the emergency department medical response to terrorism and disaster medicine David is a patron benighted in compassion and also sits on the UIC scientific advisory board his close alliance with united compassion is a direct result of a common desire for open science and collaboration in order to enhance outcomes and promote compassionate access to medicinal cannabis for Australian patients he's also got a lovely looking family and is a big fan of Doctor Who we are very privileged and proud to have him on board please welcome dr. David Paul ladies and gentlemen and Friends how the hell are you I'm David and and I'm disappointed that you bottled out there the far more interesting introduction that was waiting firstly I'd like to pay my respects to the traditional custodians of the land here I would like to pay my respects to the custodians of this knowledge who are also in this room they're as important I would like to pay respect to my peers and my mentors I am merely a Padawan in this in the company of great Jedi in this space and I have learned a great deal not only speaking to the doctors here but all sort of the people are trying to advance this cause and I feel very much part of your tribe so much to this shy grand frustration of United in compassion as probably talking about something quite different to what's in the program that's usually what happens they ask me maybe six months in advance and I'm like well I'll give you a title but it'll probably be nothing like that maybe I'll touch on something that's in the program but it'll be other things as well I'm Ella dice and we'll see if this thing works I'm likely to break it but we'll go so I'm going to talk a little bit about what we're up to and how you might want to get involved you already know all that crap I'm just David by the way I should warn you what we're talking about is dangerous it's illegal currently and I you know I think it's very important that you understand that in Australia at the moment we are still breaking the law for doing something that people are doing everywhere else around the world have hilarious if it wasn't so tragic but that's okay because I like the company of dangerous people yeah you're look like you're all in the middle ground of civil society or not you're Lisa I'm waiting to express yourselves because the most dangerous people are clever and they're compelling and they're charismatic and there's not one of you that I've spoken to since I've come here who hasn't had anime amazing story to tell me and I've got misty on several occasions listening so your excellent storytellers and for me it's a family thing we're all dangerous if your friends and you South Wales police have me killed there's another one ready to rise up and take the position we breed them hard in Canberra it's cold I like to see myself more as disruptive than dangerous and when I was growing up in school disruptive was a terrible thing now it's a business thing now it's good to be disruptive I finally been rehabilitated so let's consider ourselves all more disruptive than dangerous so where should we begin this story let's begin in the Alps right at the very beginning obviously my involvement with this bunch of renegades well I guess it starts I come to this from a medical perspective I am NOT an apologist for posh I'm an emergency doctor and I have treated people who got into strife from taking too much of it so do not for a second include me in this sort of strange exclusion group of people who are just trying to make pop medicinal pot legal for recreational purposes now it's not couldn't be further from the truth I'm a doctor and this is about medical cannabis those papers that mr. or dr. Russo was talking about the ones that suggest that cannabis can be dangerous recreationally I wrote them that was me and we did that a decade ago three years before it hit the press it can be dangerous but not in the way that we're talking about I'm not attached nobody would have me no one would pay me to do anything so I have no financial disclosures whatsoever so I'm not in the employee of any pharmaceutical company my beginning is with this loss or with this man and I saw this story and I was moved it truly moved to tears and then I met this woman and then I was terrified terrified to the point of opening my bowels because she is a terrifying lady if I had any thoughts of not getting involved they were removed by the sheer intimidation of yet another oompa loompa realm of medical cannabis I am greatly moved by this family's commitment to this course and it would be churlish of me not to be involved so I thought by what could I do I mean this is not my field in the medicinal sense but there are things that I can do and we thought we'd do something then play to our strengths before that I tell you where we're coming from these this is our soul this is what this means to us just these are the things now that's happened since we got this underway this is now just so commonplace overseas and still we're struggling in this country our tenets in this space are that our approach to medicinal cannabis over the last century has actually been factually scientifically incorrect it's been misrepresented for both philosophical and political gain and no other reason whatsoever that is now demonstrably true we are long overdue for a correction this is important that the debates regarding medicine or cannabis and recreational cannabis are separate and need to be kept separate one taints the other you can have an opinion on both but those debates must be kept separate if success is to be obtained in either there are opponents to a regulated medicinal cannabis market I respect them I disagree with them from both sides of this debate there are people who think that a regulated market of any cannabis should not exist at all and then there are those who think that there should be no regulation we're in the middle we oppose big green and we support people before profits for those of you who don't know thank you big green is just another form of exploitation like big alcohol or big sugar or big tobacco but exploiting cannabis and exploiting the the true suffering of patients and rather than putting the patients first and we will collaborate with anyone in this room who is committed to open science which means that if the science matters more than the profit you're in with us and the bottom line for us is does everything that we do in this space passed the test what do I mean by that I like to call it dance tests but it could be any one of your tests is what we are doing likely to benefit someone who was in Dan's position right now not in ten years time not when the profits are on the table right now and if that isn't the case I'm not interested so it could be any of you any of your kids if it's not good for them find someone else to play with because everyone wins when you actually put the patient first the pharmaceutical industry although they might portray things as such they don't create cures they create customers and this is not part of what I see is the future of this industry there is an attempt at adding value to cannabis which i think is a Ross on the patient and is actually a form of exploitation and we'll talk about this in a little while for those of you who think that's just me being hysterical go and have a read of this book this is a tremendous book by a young man from Ben Goldacre extraordinary UK physician who has just dissembled the pharmaceutical industry in the UK fabulous book you can get it done Kindler online it's well worth a read I have to say also I'm mortified by the manner in which some of my medicinal or medical colleagues are enrolling people in trials not for the purposes working at what's good for them but for the purposes of advancing their academic careers or for the purposes of making money in conjunction with pharmaceutical companies you your people in your not lab rats so I think this is very important that you understand who you're playing with we're going to talk about how you can spot the types of people that you're playing so I'm here to tell you about something you are a little disruptive idea this Australian medicinal cannabis Observatory it began two years ago in it was inevitable it was quite clear the writing was on the wall the medicinal cannabis legislation was going to happen there was no question in our mind took absolutely no preparation whatsoever they might have been preparing it for meteor strike for all I knew there's nothing going on in Australia to get this the background to this up and running and in Canberra which is the lovely place thank you very much despite what everybody says I love it there we're very very well positioned to negotiate and discuss policy with key players from my foreign friends you might think Sydney's the capital of Australia no it's Canberra we have deliberately avoided the clinical trial space it's messy its political it's tarnished with Big Pharma in Australia at the moment and it's not really arguing so we've tried to play to our strengths as I've said so the idea is that we engage with the Australian patients the consumers learn from their experiences and put them at the very forefront of what we want to do we want to create a trusted registry where you can give us your medical information we can look at it and we can see your progress over time but couples to the analysis of what you're actually consuming because I think that's a question in particularly many parents Minds is how do I know what I'm using is safe for my kids I'm going to show you how we intend to do that and finally to produce an independent nonpharmacologic lean on pharmaceutically sponsored education program for our clinician colleagues how many clinicians are in the room right now there there's an australian one put on you girl and so we've got a few but they're grossly outnumbered by our overseas colleagues there should be a lot more and it's our intention to bring this sort of information to a broader clinician base so you've seen the survey the survey is going gangbusters thank you very much it's a horrible survey it's like 40 questions long everybody said nobody would answered the survey and of course they don't know my army of Darkness you guys would answer anything as long as it's you know in your your key area of interest so we've already in the space of a fortnight got over 200 respondents one of the things I and in the interest of open science I'll tell you right now one of the things that we've done is we've used some of the elements from the National head cell survey to work out whether there are people who are answering the survey or crazy people because possible we're talking about an illicit drug and so we've introduced a psychometric test within there it's embedded see if you can find it and you're all normal there are no wackos answering my survey you our middle Australia and this is very useful information for me so if you have an answer this go on answer we want to hear about you this was going to inform our registry as it emerges it's been designed over the last 18 months we launched it actually in nimbin why nimbin well spiritually I think many of you folks have an affinity to nimbin I see many faces here from nimbin is like nimbin goes to the races here at the moment so it was more important to me to bring it to you folk there than it was at any sort of scientific endeavor it's for the consumer it involves the consumer and it is 100 percent not market research we have no market so how can it be market research there are other things out there that want to find more about you so that they can tailor the message so that you'll buy what they're peddling not us we just want to get to know you a bit better we will be doing this again and again and again we want your feedback when you answer the survey if you think I've setup something tell me I'm very very relaxed about being criticized I have three daughters and a wife the survey is there to inform our registry and the registry is where we want to hold your data it's not a big spooky thing it's the same sort of place where the National Household Survey data is held it's held at the Australian data archive hosted at the ANU and I'm advised that the actual security based around that is as good as anything in Australia including the intelligence community there is no way that anybody will have your data it's independent of industry we want to follow you we want to see how you're going we want to tell your stories in a scientific way and it's an opportunity for those people who are committed to the same causes as we are the open science they're not making profit out of your suffering we will share this data with them pro bono because they're on the same page we have recruited the very best analytical expertise in the country this is new to them they are interested they want to engage there's a man in the back there who knows more about this field than anybody in Australia we might play with him as well but the research school of chemistry at the ANU is truly strong and with the help of people who have been doing this for some time we hope to be able to provide a service where we can identify everything that's in everything you can provide us with the blessing of our friends there are new regulator friends my Whovian colleagues we think that we will be in a strong position to submit for a licence so that you can submit to us for the analysis of your products and we can sort the wheat from the chaff [Applause] intriguing to me that you have such expertise particularly clinical expertise in this country and such poor representation from my clinical colleagues and we really get to get me to get to the nub of this we need to get to teaching the teachers and to start educating clinicians so they are less fearful there are a whole bunch of different reasons why people are fearful of this coming from toxicology even recreational cannabis is for me is actually one of the more boring substances that just doesn't hurt as many people as people say it does and even this this medicinal stuff is even safer and yes our clinical colleagues because of the illicit connotations are terrified of getting involved in this space most clinicians are very conservative don't tell anybody too secret but they're very conservative folk I hope but those two that came here from Australia can go back to the College of Physicians and say actually the deals kind of done overseas what's the problem so our plan is to do this very legit very straight up in conjunction with the Registration Authority opera and the colleges the colleges of the physicians there's no point in doing this in an ad-lib way where it can be dismissed or excused as a sort of a factional issue it'll be online there will be a test it'll be updated regularly and current and we are very excited to be discussing with our far more qualified overseas colleagues about opening an Australian chapter of what's going on in America right now we're in negotiations very exciting to have that sort of expertise available to us the education basically consists of two types of modules basic modules and clinical modules the basic modules are broken down you would find it hard to credit but you guys haven't actually evolved that much from the rest of the world despite living on a big island for so many million years so that the whole principles of treatment are very similar here today as they are elsewhere in the world so I don't have to reinvent this [ __ ] it's already out there but what is very interesting of course is that the social history of cannabis in Australia is very different you may think that you're all here because you're the descendants of convicts which is not a bad thing you're dangerous that's to be expected but in fact there's an abundance of evidence to suggest that Joseph Banks was very interested in establishing your country as an outdoors hemp growing industry not a lot of people know that this is the business of hemp is in the fiber of your country I have to take the opportunity to say thank you so much to the people in that I've been living in the National Library of Australia going through the old newspapers and looking at the old documents to set up this course and put it in an Australian context and it won't be much surprise to many of you particularly the more conspiratorial of you that a lot of this has actually been denuded from the internet there you can actually rewrite history on the internet but you can't write rewrite hardcopy and going back to the archives it's fascinating to see how frequently cannabis related products were being used in Australia for everyone everywhere there's a great story of horsemen riding into Melbourne the sort of you know banjo Patterson lost with the raku Buress I don't know if they existed then but they were presumably hysterical equivalent of the cobras and whips demanding that the attempts to ban cannabis containing tinctures be reversed because the only thing they had access to a bush that's no longer available on the Internet in the archives so they're amazing this is clora dine which is used up until very recently well certainly within a century which was an extract containing cannabis in Australia used for everything and the idea is that our first module the social history side thing would be open to you all there's a story to be told and you need to know that story you have the story of your children you need to know the history too because the history has been rewritten there has been revisionism in this space and it does not represent the truth the clinical modules we are deliberately limiting to a narrow group of conditions we have to we have to be able to pitch this to people who are skeptical and who will only accept that which is absolutely concrete so what we're aiming at at the moment is cancer and palliative care severe intractable seizure disorder and refractory pain we have every anticipation that this selection will expand with the support of our colleagues from overseas and with increased buy-in from our colleagues at home there are definitely such things as cannabis use disorders we need there's no drug that has no side effect and there are also issues to do with special groups of users the use of cannabis and pregnancy the use of cannabis in children driving in cannabis these things are the big questions that the Polly's and the legislators want to know about and we need to address those if we're going to advance this course we're in dangerous times here let me just sort of digress this is what I do I apologize in Australia we're on the cusp of something great but we're easily diverted and this is why because of the dollar value of this market for no other reason and I warn you now there's snake oil merchants out there be careful there are people who want to take advantage of you and there are challenges ahead for us and I largely see them as follows in opposition as exploitation impatience and legislation there are three main groups of opponents to this cause those who just don't know it and I put among them sadly tragically my own confession who are grossly unaware of the literature and they're also people who are confused between the difference between recreational and medicinal cannabis let's be quite clear within this group there's also group of people who deliberately confound recreational and medicinal cannabis to try to tar the two with the same brush well that's easy that's the we address that through education that's not a problem for me there are those who have a moral opposition to any sort of illicit drug use they're not prepared to accept that the fact that this drug is illicit it's got nothing to do with the harm that's implicit on society is more of a abstention ism temperance movement that initiated this and that's fine that's fine too there are people who I don't give blood transfusions to because they reject them do I let them determine who should have blood transfusions in the country no no I don't I respect their rights not to be cured that's fine I do not respect their right to determine who else should not be cured there are those involved in companies that make opiates or other analgesics these we put to the sword I don't know if you're familiar with the news outlet called Vice it's not nearly as naughty as it sounds it's tremendous is an independent news network and they did a tremendous expose so it's not me that's telling you this advice but if you look at some of the most vociferous opponents to cannabis medication in America for example you should also quietly look and see who their sponsors are this is compromise this is compromise and I tell you right now this happens in Australia too so look to see when they're giving their speeches when they're giving their papers who's sponsoring them these people receive enormous endowments from the pharmaceutical companies that are directly producing the direct competitors of a cannabis market one other subcategory I've come across in Australia very recently and it's very disappointing but people who are working with companies that would block the use of a botanical product and these include my own colleagues in my profession and in science I have a serious problem with this and there is a war emerging winter is coming why would anybody do that because it competes with the product look at this this one here Sativex I'm sure it's great it's lovely it costs $16,000 a year to prescribe and the London School of Economics I dunno if you've heard of them is kind of like Harvard for economics when they're cost analysis there's absolutely no benefit in providing a pharmaceutical compound which could equally be replicated by a botanically grown one the only benefit in this space is for the pharmaceutical company period so what we're seeing at the moment in Australia because of the money involved its transformation of good scientists into bad of good doctors into bad caveat emptor watch who you're playing with and what you're buying if you want any idea about what's going on as far as the rest of the world is watching one of the things I have to do in emergency medicine is keep my eye on everything everywhere always and and the data that I guess with regards to illicit drugs comes from the diverse set of sources from consumers from dance music magazines and the like this is a graphic novel well which is written our series of cartoons that like an allegorical sort of story the equivalent of a modern-day pilgrims progress for a cannabis and as a series of heroes and their trials and tribulations in dealing with big green it warns us of the shape of things to come it warns us of a character or a series of entities called the prophets before people that's what they look like they're like the bad little child out of Sin City they're sinister and this is who they are they present themselves to you as friends and then their darkness grows and it brings others and it spreads now in the global market for this graphic novel there is one nationality that is represented with its own character this is the rest of the world looking in to Australia that's right it's Australia so the rest of the world is looking at Australia and saying sweet Jesus alive who the hell is in control here because the big companies are taking control so how do we identify this exploitation cui bono Cicero the Roman lawyer and orator used to say who stands to benefit is the purpose to make money who is making that money is it going offshore is there a commitment to open science what are they promising and when do they say they're going to deliver it what conditions do they demand of you are you being asked to sign confidentiality agreements and what sort of conflicts of interest are involved I give these to you to ask anyone who wants your help because your help is invaluable at the moment these are things that we need to be aware of as a tribe this concept of corporate capture and regulatory capture corporate capture is the idea that a few entities will buy into this market to such a degree that there will be no possibility of negotiation this is something very well-known in other fields in in business the consolidation of the market where a few firms dominate everything when that happens as is the case with the alcohol and tobacco industry what you can do is then determine regulation now I have great faith in my regulatory colleague who's with us today he's a Doctor Who fan and there's no way the doctor who would be swayed by this sort of thing he has some ambition to be the next Doctor Who and if he can stay true to the course I can work with him on that plan so what do we do about exploitation what do you do about exploitation it's actually a lot easier than you might think because you hold all the cards you hold everything that everybody wants and if you don't like what's happening you take your ball and you walk away it's that simple researchers industry everybody needs you more than you need them walk away from them we've seen we've seen the way it should be our friends from Israel have shown us what it's like to play together what it's like to be open and share your knowledge that's what we need we do not need to be another brand in Australia I think one of the big things in this community is probably impatience why the [ __ ] are we still here what are we still talking about this choice why isn't happening as the expects expect a ssin of the consumers matched however to the hesitancy largely of my profession and there is going to be a battle here between these two and we need to make sure that we conduct ourselves with a degree of restraint with humor with you know what we all know that we are as a group a group of caring individuals those of you who have small children will know this we need to have courage and be kind some Cinderella but there's no better way of applying this those people who don't believe in us be implacable but be kind because these are people who could help us if we can recruit them to the course there are challenges ahead in legislation you may not be happy with how far it's gone I have I have got mixed emotions by but there's no denying there have been massive bans in fact huge cynics the great shoulders of alcohol and drugs policy people like Alex modak two years ago at a similar gathering that we had in Canberra said this would not occur in the next decade so in fact this is far faster than many of us had ever expected would occur this local farm to farm seal Ark is well underway and I'm sure as and when the Polly's come up with an equally quirky sounding equivalent we might actually develop some way of getting the pharmacy into the patient it may sound quite extraordinary to my overseas colleagues that we are in a position to grow in Australia and we've got these enormous forests which are going nowhere there is no compassionate access scheme in Australia that's crap I'm calling BS tix is not a compassionate access system the mengdan megator sucks its eligibility is incredibly limited it's under justice for Christ's sake not health it has to be under health it's dependent upon police discretion if it was under Lou's discretion that'll be grand but most people know the quantities involved completely confound it reveals the misunderstanding of people between the differences between recreational and medicinal cannabis and there are certain researchers in Australia who are opposed to a real compassionate access scheme because it could interfere with their clinical trials well boo-hoo-hoo I'm terribly sorry that it might there are issues of driving and we need to address those and that's important so look I think I'd been very restrained people who know me will know that's the case so I thought you know I don't want to disappoint my opponents who were scattered to the audience so I thought it was time to be dangerous because I am dangerous this group of people is dangerous and an implacable civilly disobedient way these are dangerous people that you're dealing with here these are the people who I think if I was a politician I'd be nervous about imagine you were having a general election and these people were wandering the streets goodness gracious me you as the group are articulate you're well-informed you are morally justified you have the side of righteousness on your side you represent in fact the majority of the population perhaps not as activist and advocate as you are but the rest of the population walks with you you campaign with wit and satire and it makes people laugh you're a well resourced and you're focused on a single issue you're terrifying there are days I wander and I think maybe you're Irish I want to introduce this concept to you all right so this is for my political friends in any population there is a spectrum of opinions of what we stand for some are complete nutjob ideas I got this metaphor I do occasionally use Twitter and my favorite hashtag at the moment in Australia is our wnj right-wing nut job I'll get to you that almost daily so the way things are usually sort of posed within policy is that most things that are policy only get adopted because they're popular because the result is going to be beneficial to people who are charged with winning what is essentially a beauty contest every three or four years in Australia that policy bracket is very narrow indeed it is a very safe place and at the moment it's largely being determined by what the politicians want to talk about not what the population wants to talk about this this is called Overton's window of political possibility it's a thing and what you see it's it's frequently in political circles it's manipulated so when you saw when Tony Abbott got elected the the first thing he did was issue a manifesto about turning I think Australia into a military state or something much further to the right of where most Australians felt it should be which gave him the opportunity then to drift left and look as if he's being kind and that's that's a political game that all politicians play we're in the middle of an election and these people who are generally speaking unassailable they are so vulnerable right now and it's a little naughty for me to say that because I'm sure that they're scared but I really truly believe that you have to make this a political issue there are those of you who would say no now is not the right time I disagree now is the time to get undertakings now is the time to get promises now is the time to act questions which will go on record and to which people can be held responsible for in the next few years the only reason this has happened only reason we have got as far as we have is because of the pressure of this community there's no politician who is driving this forward you are driving this forward to my political friends the people who are looking a little too casual to be really casual you have options you can either broaden policy to include this issue that's a safe option for you because if you don't Australia is going to get all Canada on your ass and they're going to shift in its entirety to the left so you either include something like this in your policy or you drive voters in a direction you really don't want them to go I don't get to vote so I don't have a dog in this fight but that's the outcome this is the way politics works and I think your politicians need to be reminded of this every now and again so I was going to show you a video but I don't think we have the technology so I better wind up before I get lynched or arrested apparently very easy to get arrested in this town we're living in very interesting times I think in opportune times the times of where we can make a difference there is progress don't be downhearted there is progress being made you would not believe the Furious activity that's going on behind the scenes here we just have a particularly conservative electric electric group of representatives there's a hundred years of dumb down stupid prohibition that needs to be acted against it's going to take at least a decade to work that around to the way that maybe somewhere like Israel or the United States is doing it's a sad indictment with great respect to my American colleagues it's embarrassing that they are ahead of us in this field honestly seriously how did that ever happen the evolving market is naive and it's vulnerable then it needs protection and needs protection from you there is an abundance of profits there are zeros that I don't understand in this markets I'm not interested I've decided to have children not BMWs but nobody has to be mercenary there's plenty to go around both academically and financially we can collaborate like our friends from from the u.s. are collaborating like our friends from Israel are collaborating and not be trying to stick the knife in each other and at all stages this issue demands the patronage of the patient population this is your issue you only do not give it away lightly so if you're interested in what we do come and chat to me I love chatting as you noticed answer our survey please correct our survey if in the next version of the survey you think we haven't addressed something let me know I will put it in I might even call that question your question who knows but let us know what you think of it come and visit us here we now have the with our Australian drugs Observatory have a site where you view come and support us I don't want your money I don't need your money there's plenty money I'm a genius at getting grants I have sideburns and an Irish accent you guys are vulnerable to that sort of [ __ ] but what I do want you to do any donation you give us over $2 it's like a vote and I in Canberra can turn to people and say yeah I see your opinion on this and I'll raise you the 200,000 people who said they like what we're doing to [ __ ] you so come and support us let us help you I've burned all my bridges now today with Pharma anyway so there's no way I can be accused of collaborating with them I hope that I can persuade you that we're on the side of the Angels we don't want to make a buck out of this we want to offer an alternative that is going to be good for the country that I'm bringing my children into bringing them up as Australians I want something a little bit more compassionate than currently exists so if you like what we're doing come and follow us contact me follow me on Twitter and continue being dangerous kudos to you all you"
fB1JEI7rcIo,Medicinal cannabis to be easier and quicker to access,2017-02-08T04:23:40Z,the government is promising medical cannabis will be quicker and easier to access and the policy changes announced today but admits there are only a small number of quality products available the changes mean medicinal cannabis products will no longer require ministerial sign off and responsibility for approvals has been given to the Ministry of Health the associate Health Minister Peter dance is a relatively small list of appropriate cannabis-based product will be compiled to provide clarity on the issue I spoke to mr Dunne and asked what would happen now I'm going to be contacting the medical profession and the pharmaceutical society with advice from the Ministry of Health on a list of products for the not necessary of pharmaceutical grade but which made good manufacturing practice but they might want to consider prescribing for patients who seek a medicinal cannabis based solutions so when you put the two together more information a streamlined process more progress but what practical difference does this make two people who want medical cabinet cannabis well they first we'll need to talk to their GPS I always have done get a prescription from the GP and the specialist and then have that considered and signed off by the Ministry of Health at the moment they then have to come to me on top of that for approval I'm taking that step out of the process so it will make it quicker it will make it better is that going to mean more cases of prescribed I don't know because that really depends on what the decision of a medical practitioner as to whether that's the best treatment available and what is your message to medical practitioners because there's a lot of skepticism and the profession about medical cannabis and I think it's a really important point my message to them is pretty bluntest to be open to consider the facts and the evidence and to make the best and this decision in the interests of your patients I think that some are some just don't want to know and some are prejudiced I think that the the days of not one can I am prejudiced are over this was about really saying let's look at the evidence of the facts and make the best decision you can in the interests of your patients and I'm not telling doctors but they must prescribe cannabis based medical products that be totally irresponsible of me to do that I'm simply saying that they need to consider the options and make the best decisions they feel that are in their patients interests and this include botanical products it well the lists that we will provide will be of products that meet a good manufacturing standard I can't tell you what that Lister's at the stage because I still being compiled but most of the products will be well known to us and I suspect it will be relatively smaller number rozbell from the drug foundation says this isn't groundbreaking it's a small step it's not significant he said the biggest issue is the lack of products and price price right and this was never intended to be a groundbreaking decision this is one step in a series of steps last December for instance I made an equally important announcement which was overlooked which was that patients seeking Santa vics for multiple sclerosis conditions no longer need the approval of the Ministry of help they can get that directly on the prescription of their medical advisor so this was one more step along the way but Ross's point is absolutely correct the issue worldwide as the availability of products of a quality standard it's pretty low there are very few and the issue also is priced on the price front we treat medicines or bust nature the same way as we trick every other medicine so the funding decision is one for pharmac to make based on an application from the manufacturer or supplier it's not an issue that the government gets involved in for obvious reasons mr Dunne how much have you been influenced by campaigns like the renton case like Helen Kelly on this to be perfectly honest not at all I set out right from the beginning to have a clear process in mind that we would work through once we had a sufficient bullet body of expertise and knowledge about these products and their impacts on particular patients then we could start to move in the direction that we have done well I've got node I'm not trying to be disrespectful towards the individual cases or campaigns I've deliberately kept my distance from them because I've been solely concerned that our decisions are based on the evidence and the fact and I've not tried to get involved and if you like some of the the quite traumatic personal circumstances are under individuals I've really focused on what's in the best interests overall and I think the steady progressive way which we've approached this is justified and right and as certainly stacks up well against international practice and just getting back to the issue of sourcing products should New Zealand get into manufacturing these products well the difficulty is that there are a few manufacturers who control the licensing of their products very tightly there's nothing to stop clinical trials taking place in New Zealand for people wishing to trial new products the reality is that that provision has been available for some years no one has shown any interest in undertaking such trials in this country and the reason is quite simple their perception of the market sizes that it's very small and this is in a way typical of all medicines and all medical medical related products there's nothing different in that respect so it's a factor of our size which means we've had to look overseas we need to keep close eye on what's going on in other places like Australia who are just starting the clinical trial process are a little bit behind us like monitoring what's happening in jurisdictions in Europe and elsewhere so we keep our eyes open to that those possibilities but the bottom line is until more products become available there's always going to be a challenge in that respect is this a step towards the criminalization of recreational kano the government's got no interest nor has the leader of the Labour Party in decriminalizing recreational cannabis and to try and bring the two together is is wrong this is a completely separate issue there is some evidence available that cannabis based medicines can be effective in particular situations my focus are simply on progressing that good news for you an election year I mean a big steep this raises your profile I don't think the this was really about electoral timing this was always a time frame I had in mind from the time that the issue first came on the public agenda about two years ago I felt that by about now we would be at a stage where a sufficient body of knowledge and expertise had built up from the Ministry of Health so but it would be appropriate to make this delegation bear in mind that the number of cases that came before me as Minister was about seven only and every single one of those was approved so there's not a despite the noise there's not actually when it comes to the crunch a huge demand historically for these medicines in New Zealand and that brings us back to the supply issue the perception of us pliers is on a big market here so it's always going to be a challenge brush and getting it getting good quality available product sure and just last thing mr. Dunn a you planning to spend and or how do you it's like that's an entirely separate question I've said all along as my intention to do so but that's got nothing to do with today's Spence
0ygtX2nyexo,A doctor&#39;s case for medical marijuana | David Casarett,2017-05-17T22:17:23Z,"I would like to tell you
about the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to me in my years
of working as a palliative care physician. This happened a couple of years ago. I was asked as a consultant
to see a woman in her 70s -- retired English professor
who had pancreatic cancer. I was asked to see her because
she had pain, nausea, vomiting ... When I went to see her,
we talked about those symptoms and in the course of that consultation, she asked me whether I thought
that medical marijuana might help her. I thought back to everything that I had learned in medical school
about medical marijuana, which didn't take very long
because I had learned absolutely nothing. And so I told her that as far as I knew, medical marijuana
had no benefits whatsoever. And she smiled and nodded and reached
into the handbag next to the bed, and pulled out a stack of about a dozen
randomized controlled trials showing that medical
marijuana has benefits for symptoms like nausea
and pain and anxiety. She handed me those articles and said, ""Maybe you should read these
before offering an opinion ... doctor."" (Laughter) So I did. That night I read all of those articles
and found a bunch more. When I came to see her the next morning, I had to admit that it looks like
there is some evidence that marijuana can offer medical benefits and I suggested that if she
really was interested, she should try it. You know what she said? This 73-year-old,
retired English professor? She said, ""I did try it
about six months ago. It was amazing. I've been using it every day since. It's the best drug I've discovered. I don't know why it took me 73 years
to discover this stuff. It's amazing."" (Laughter) That was the moment at which I realized I needed to learn something
about medical marijuana because what I was prepared for
in medical school bore no relationship to reality. So I started reading more articles,
I started talking to researchers, I started talking to doctors, and most importantly,
I started listening to patients. I ended up writing a book
based on those conversations, and that book really revolved
around three surprises -- surprises to me, anyway. One I already alluded to -- that there really are some benefits
to medical marijuana. Those benefits may not be
as huge or as stunning as some of the most avid proponents
of medical marijuana would have us believe, but they are real. Surprise number two: medical marijuana does have some risks. Those risks may not be
as huge and as scary as some of the opponents of medical
marijuana would have us believe, but they are real risks, nonetheless. But it was the third surprise
that was most ... surprising. And that is that a lot
of the patients I talked with who've turned to medical
marijuana for help, weren't turning to medical marijuana
because of its benefits or the balance of risks and benefits, or because they thought
it was a wonder drug, but because it gave them
control over their illness. It let them manage their health in a way that was productive and efficient and effective and comfortable for them. To show you what I mean,
let me tell you about another patient. Robin was in her early 40s when I met her. She looked though
like she was in her late 60s. She had suffered from rheumatoid arthritis
for the last 20 years, her hands were gnarled by arthritis, her spine was crooked, she had to rely
on a wheelchair to get around. She looked weak and frail, and I guess physically she probably was, but emotionally,
cognitively, psychologically, she was among the toughest
people I've ever met. And when I sat down next to her in a medical marijuana dispensary
in Northern California to ask her about why she turned
to medical marijuana, what it did for her and how it helped her, she started out by telling me things that I had heard
from many patients before. It helped with her anxiety; it helped with her pain; when her pain was better,
she slept better. And I'd heard all that before. But then she said something
that I'd never heard before, and that is that it gave her
control over her life and over her health. She could use it when she wanted, in the way that she wanted, at the dose and frequency
that worked for her. And if it didn't work for her,
then she could make changes. Everything was up to her. The most important thing she said was she didn't need
anybody else's permission -- not a clinic appointment,
not a doctor's prescription, not a pharmacist's order. It was all up to her. She was in control. And if that seems like a little thing
for somebody with chronic illness, it's not -- not at all. When we face a chronic serious illness, whether it's rheumatoid arthritis
or lupus or cancer or diabetes, or cirrhosis, we lose control. And note what I said: ""when,"" not ""if."" All of us at some point in our lives
will face a chronic serious illness that causes us to lose control. We'll see our function decline,
some of us will see our cognition decline, we'll be no longer able
to care for ourselves, to do the things that we want to do. Our bodies will betray us, and in that process, we'll lose control. And that's scary. Not just scary -- that's frightening, it's terrifying. When I talk to my patients,
my palliative care patients, many of whom are facing illnesses
that will end their lives, they have a lot of be frightened of -- pain, nausea, vomiting,
constipation, fatigue, their impending mortality. But what scares them
more than anything else is this possibility that at some point, tomorrow or a month from now, they're going to lose
control of their health, of their lives, of their healthcare, and they're going to become
dependent on others, and that's terrifying. So it's no wonder really
that patients like Robin, who I just told you about, who I met in that clinic, turn to medical marijuana to try to claw back
some semblance of control. How do they do it though? How do these medical
marijuana dispensaries -- like the one where I met Robin -- how do they give patients like Robin
back the sort of control that they need? And how do they do it in a way that mainstream
medical hospitals and clinics, at least for Robin, weren't able to? What's their secret? So I decided to find out. I went to a seedy clinic
in Venice Beach in California and got a recommendation that would allow me
to be a medical marijuana patient. I got a letter of recommendation
that would let me buy medical marijuana. I got that recommendation illegally, because I'm not
a resident of California -- I should note that. I should also note, for the record, that I never used that letter
of recommendation to make a purchase, and to all of you DEA agents out there -- (Laughter) love the work that you're doing, keep it up. (Laughter) Even though it didn't let me
make a purchase though, that letter was priceless
because it let me be a patient. It let me experience
what patients like Robin experience when they go to a medical
marijuana dispensary. And what I experienced -- what they experience every day, hundreds of thousands
of people like Robin -- was really amazing. I walked into the clinic, and from the moment that I entered
many of these clinics and dispensaries, I felt like that dispensary, that clinic, was there for me. There were questions
at the outset about who I am, what kind of work I do, what my goals are in looking
for a medical marijuana prescription, or product, what my goals are,
what my preferences are, what my hopes are, how do I think, how do I hope
this might help me, what am I afraid of. These are the sorts of questions that patients like Robin
get asked all the time. These are the sorts of questions
that make me confident that the person I'm talking with
really has my best interests at heart and wants to get to know me. The second thing I learned
in those clinics is the availability of education. Education from the folks
behind the counter, but also education
from folks in the waiting room. People I met were more than happy,
as I was sitting next to them -- people like Robin -- to tell me about who they are,
why they use medical marijuana, what helps them, how it helps them, and to give me advice and suggestions. Those waiting rooms really are
a hive of interaction, advice and support. And third, the folks behind the counter. I was amazed at how willing
those people were to spend sometimes an hour or more
talking me through the nuances of this strain versus that strain, smoking versus vaporizing, edibles versus tinctures -- all, remember, without me
making any purchase whatsoever. Think about the last time
you went to any hospital or clinic and the last time anybody spent an hour
explaining those sorts of things to you. The fact that patients like Robin
are going to these clinics, are going to these dispensaries and getting that sort
of personalized attention and education and service, really should be a wake-up call
to the healthcare system. People like Robin are turning away
from mainstream medicine, turning to medical marijuana dispensaries because those dispensaries
are giving them what they need. If that's a wake-up call
to the medical establishment, it's a wake-up call that many
of my colleagues are either not hearing or not wanting to hear. When I talk to my colleagues,
physicians in particular, about medical marijuana, they say, ""Oh, we need more evidence. We need more research into benefits,
we need more evidence about risks."" And you know what? They're right. They're absolutely right. We do need much more evidence
about the benefits of medical marijuana. We also need to ask the federal government
to reschedule marijuana to Schedule II, or to deschedule it entirely
to make that research possible. We also need more research
into medical marijuana's risks. Medical marijuana's risks -- we know a lot about
the risks of recreational use, we know next to nothing
about the risks of medical marijuana. So we absolutely do need research, but to say that we need research and not that we need
to make any changes now is to miss the point entirely. People like Robin
aren't seeking out medical marijuana because they think it's a wonder drug, or because they think
it's entirely risk-free. They seek it out because the context
in which it's delivered and administered and used, gives them the sort of control
they need over their lives. And that's a wake-up call
we really need to pay attention to. The good news though is that
there are lessons we can learn today from those medical marijuana dispensaries. And those are lessons
we really should learn. These are often small,
mom-and-pop operations run by people with no medical training. And while it's embarrassing to think that many of these clinics
and dispensaries are providing services and support and meeting patients' needs in ways that billion-dollar
healthcare systems aren't -- we should be embarrassed by that -- but we can also learn from that. And there are probably
three lessons at least that we can learn
from those small dispensaries. One: we need to find ways
to give patients more control in small but important ways. How to interact with healthcare providers, when to interact
with healthcare providers, how to use medications
in ways that work for them. In my own practice, I've gotten much more
creative and flexible in supporting my patients
in using drugs safely to manage their symptoms -- with the emphasis on safely. Many of the drugs I prescribe
are drugs like opioids or benzodiazepines which can be dangerous if overused. But here's the point. They can be dangerous if they're overused, but they can also be ineffective
if they're not used in a way that's consistent with
what patients want and need. So that flexibility,
if it's delivered safely, can be extraordinarily valuable
for patients and their families. That's number one. Number two: education. Huge opportunities to learn from some of the tricks
of those medical marijuana dispensaries to provide more education that doesn't require
a lot of physician time necessarily, or any physician time, but opportunities to learn
about what medications we're using and why, prognoses, trajectories of illness, and most importantly, opportunities for patients
to learn from each other. How can we replicate what goes on in those clinic and medical
dispensary waiting rooms? How patients learn from each other,
how people share with each other. And last but not least, putting patients first the way
those medical marijuana dispensaries do, making patients feel
legitimately like what they want, what they need, is why, as healthcare providers, we're here. Asking patients about their hopes,
their fears, their goals and preferences. As a palliative care provider, I ask all my patients what they're
hoping for and what they're afraid of. But here's the thing. Patients shouldn't have to wait
until they're chronically seriously ill, often near the end of life, they shouldn't have to wait
until they're seeing a physician like me before somebody asks them, ""What are you hoping for?"" ""What are you afraid of?"" That should be baked into the way
that healthcare is delivered. We can do this -- we really can. Medical marijuana dispensaries
and clinics all across the country are figuring this out. They're figuring this out in ways that larger, more mainstream
health systems are years behind. But we can learn from them, and we have to learn from them. All we have to do is swallow our pride -- put aside the thought for a minute that because we have
lots of letters after our name, because we're experts, because we're chief medical officers
of a large healthcare system, we know all there is to know
about how to meet patients' needs. We need to swallow our pride. We need to go visit
a few medical marijuana dispensaries. We need to figure out what they're doing. We need to figure out
why so many patients like Robin are leaving our mainstream medical clinics and going to these medical
marijuana dispensaries instead. We need to figure out
what their tricks are, what their tools are, and we need to learn from them. If we do, and I think we can,
and I absolutely think we have to, we can guarantee all of our patients
will have a much better experience. Thank you. (Applause)"

company of people who step outside the law to be able to offer their children some relief from the medical conditions they have that are not being serviced by our so-called medical fraternity I myself have been using cannabis oil for prostate cancer and also melanoma now I'm not sure whether it's just that that's doing it but what I've had these for 14 years I'm still alive still working I was told I had six months if I didn't get chemotherapy or radiation enemy that was 14 years ago I chose not to go down that road and I found out that there's a wealth of material available if you look for it so obviously you people here are thinkers you've come along because you want to hear what's on offer and be able to take home hopefully some hope and also some information that may help you with people you know loved ones you have that have a condition that may benefit from the use of cannabis as well so I'd like to introduce our panel first up and I'll get them to just raise their hands because they're not in the order of my sheath so I'll just get them to raise their hands as they announce their names I've got Carol from she's the CEO of epilepsy action you'll be hearing more from her Linda Malcolm from Tasmania there was something with epilepsy is benefit from so Michelle whitewall also some with epilepsy from Queensland and my gold stupid Michael's got a story to tell I believe him to do that and Michael Landers Michael has a daughter with epilepsy and he just saved me a fight over at school I'm gonna let he tell the story but I'll just say this cannabis and Vegemite sandwiches okay guys from Queensland who is from Afghanistan who suffers from PTSD PTSD the vicar was he last year the husband he's speaking later so he's not on the panel today but you'll be hearing from all these people that you'll be hearing this story and also seeing some of the Magnificent achievements Jenny did I forget Jenny and Jenny I'm sorry please give Kenny a special [Applause] thanks Jenny legging pedal is that your lucky number Jenna okay so he fix this talk amongst yourselves for a second okay okay okay so first up would you put your hands together and welcome Carol island from epilepsy action she's Lucy thanks Tony maybe just a clarification at the beginning I'm probably the one that doesn't step outside the law however I've been told of a very fine line I the MD end and C or the blip C action I have been for 11 years where for most of that 11 years our focus was on epilepsy advice and epilepsy education training in the use of particular and HIPPA Liberty rescue drugs and so on the last two or three years I'm sort of wondering whether on the CEO of the young medicinal cannabis and epilepsy Association which just gives you some idea of how many of our consumers are calling to talk to us about cannabis a couple of couple of disclosures by actual and please don't rule I actually sit on the Australian Council for the use of medicinal cannabis at the federal level I also sit on the steering committee of the New South Wales trials in medicinal cannabis and I'm also on the advisory board of the Lambert and you've run out of Sydney University so by that I demonstrate that I am doing my best to work with the legal and regulatory and research authorities in the field of medicinal cannabis a few years ago when I first heard about cannabis as a treatment option for epilepsy I computed like everybody else that I knew around me our nurses were horrified no we only knew negative things about cannabis not good things about cannabis and just to put this in context with our clients 800,000 of us in Australia will be diagnosed with epilepsy in our lifetime we round about 70 60 to 70 percent of those people will get reasonable decision control with the available antiepileptic medications that doesn't take into account the incredible side effects they might also get but but then we'll get reasonable seizure control quality of life for me was still very a great deal so what changed for for me and and it was interesting I was actually with a group of people here last night and one of them was facilitating a focus session in a sacred circle and asked why are we here so I sat thinking about why am I here given given that I'm usually in a suit and a frog and you know even in meetings and now this year in last year I've been in nimbin what changed for me a couple of years ago is I got to know some of the people using medicinal cannabis there's still clients of ours you know the people with epilepsy they need our they need our support and over those couple of years I've got to know particularly Michele wife Lynne you know we've all got to know each other and I've heard their stories of what's happened with their children in some cases out our children in some cases younger children and I've seen that before and afters I have watched children with who were not mobile not verbal really really not progressive in life and those relentless seizures doing more and more damage to their already compromised brains and if I were a parent in that situation would I try and think possibly point of course and seeing those kids and hearing the stories from these parents I developed a bit of A man-trap you guys have heard me say it a few times and I'm going to say it again loving parents don't lie there is no reason why they would break the law give their children cannabis and then say that it's had a really really good effect until control the seizures as well improve their quality of life sometimes it's not improving the seizures sometimes it's just about quality of life and in virtually every instance you know I've seen that to be the case so I can't be a medicinal cannabis advocate not with the hat I wear with epilepsy action Australia but I'm absolutely convinced that this is a treatment option for our kids and I've taken a personal viewpoint that it doesn't matter what particular course people are taking how they're accessing that cannabis to me personally they need to get it and they need to get it now because their children their loved ones so I will support the you know the regulatory the the medical the research I'll support that and I'm involved in that mobile support these people sitting up here on the stage that need as much help as anyone there in dreadfully difficult circumstances and when I sat and reflected last night as I was asked to do and while I was here I thought about a range and reasons why people are involved in the medicinal cannabis movement and they're all over the country and they're all approaching us and in some cases see in his monetary in some cases it's political you know in some cases I think it's field but I'm singing here because these people need our support and and you know we need to do whatever we can to give relief and help to those that are suffering right now it's not in my view it's not ethical to know that there is something that can order and then withhold it from people so thank you happy to take any questions later but that's why I'm here thank you Tara long whoopsy action you know next up we've got Linda Malcolm who were also here last year and [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's Jeremy he's 26 he's had uncontrolled epilepsy since he was six years old as a result of suspected barley colitis and as you saw I Adam his treatments all failed they all came the serious side effects when we decided to trial cannabis for Germany he was on three anticonvulsants the latest one was called the impact and the neurologist suggested we increase it to target dose white which we did we always did what the neurologist said we faced his dose it was just 200 milligrams twice a day and Jeremy started jumping out of moving vehicles he went insane he was in drug a drug-induced psychosis from an anticonvulsant the neurologist wanted to add a sedative into the knees and we said no look he's being medicated enough we're going to try cannabis and we did the journey is that seizure free but he's quiet you know quality of life is so much better now he's not suffering those toxic events that would give him his any convulsions and he'd start vomiting he'd have blurred vision he couldn't walk straight he kept falling over so what it's meant to be on cannabis is that we've been able to reduce about 95% of his anticonvulsant medications so he's so much healthier so much happier what I really wanted to say once enough I'm really important I think parents should know is please keep engaging your doctors don't make a disconnect with you with your training specialist you need them to help me you need them to follow your child or your loved one so keep the communication open and don't wait don't wait because of your child gets to 26 years old the chances are that you'll never be able to stop their seizures and the damage will be done the damages [Applause] [Music] we'd sing okay but this is a heartfelt situation you've got people we're trying to deal with the condition that their children have and there's a criminal conspiracy out there that is making it almost impossible for people to deal with in the law unfortunately we've got people like Carol they were working within the system and she's bringing her knowledge and understanding into their consciousness so she's bringing that into the conversation because she's been witnessing it and it was just Malcolm I just didn't want to see you sitting there with that something to say now we've got Michelle Whitehall Michelle is from Queensland and she has a son with epilepsy she also was he allows do you um hi everyone we're just gonna play a short video my number today eight seven six I am shy I am 11 I live in Busan I were born healthy in 10 Way 2010 I got sick I have big seizes the doctor said I have epilepsy I have free we're tight I do remember my way up I was in the hospital a lot I have a large chest I wanted to go to school play and have a lot of fun but I will to sit John Pilger made me more 635 pound a day I got a chair wheels and a Jew to my belly my hand always had and I had to wear helmet I have heard a lot lied and a lot of people say my life one day my mom said to my daughter that a plan my help me they laugh and my mom saw sad my mom didn't sleep much because she'd have to keep me safe my mum on TV Allah with me asking for help she didn't one be the God my mom spoke to a lot was pulling people but no one listened but see my friends all our kids like me done every day from here that didn't work my life began in December 2014 my head stopped hurting I woke up I feel so good I can talk I can walk I can eat I can play I can watch I can now leave I am Alive cancer medicine help me stay alive honey Bella make my medicine he care about me he's free now my mom is crazy I am Kai I am 11 I want can be helping me yeah I'm Wendell I am stay on campus 800 days with no seasons - with no season please that's just experience the support Carol provides not only to our family but to let him out and every other family out there we feel listened I'm really grateful for that as the video stated Tony Bauer makes Joe's medicine for free we do not play Jays now he was on 35 tablets a day having up to 500 seizures a day we had 36 mgs on pharmaceutical and there was never any change we've had for ages today on cannabis medicine two of the syndromes have gone and the ages are now clear so my I suppose my point why I'm here is that we we have worked without doctors I have worked hard to educate them prior to administering cannabis during the period of starting and still now you know I'm not an expert on cannabis I'm not a neurologist I'm just a mom who knows their son but to think that I know better than one or the other is wrong you know I find a lot of families hearing stories like jives and even linen mouths and everybody else that's in the media and cannabis is hope and cannabis is a medicine and should be treated like one but when you've got complex children on pharmaceuticals adding cannabis to that can be quite scary and without the research and without the specialists on board and speaking to our ins and connecting to the right people you know it's it can be it can be dangerous like you know in our situation with Pediatrics you simply cannot win your own medications because you choose to do so as a parent if anything goes pear-shaped is actually a criminal offense to do that on top of cannabis and that's where Children's Services etc do get involved so you know parents I can't express enough knowing your pharmaceuticals race so it says no excuse why you can't if you can be on social media and if you've got time to sit in the bar go have a shower or what have you you have two minutes to actually get on the internet and connect or get on the internet and know what your child is actually taking because cannabis alone you know you really don't know without testing what is in that bottle and throwing that on top of pharmaceuticals you're you're stepping outside of the box to save your child's life you need it to go as smoothly as possible thank you single month no my husband actually wears the federal government well it's good to have a man on the inside maybe into something useful one I mean the idea of 500 seizures a day I was shocked at that it was a probably one of our first media interviews either 2012 or 13 what about neurologists agreed to meet with a think it was one of those Sunday night I went back tonight and they actually worked out with eg how often Java surgery and I actually found that out once that meteor actually aired that he was having up to 500 seizures a day and joy was um because of the three rare epilepsy syndromes we were automatically on our own even though we had you know Carol and the organization but a lot of the kids are rare and in our case we already didn't have that another family like I've come across some families in Australia with one or two Ajay syndromes but never three not even around the world yet and I work with a lot of the families overseas and communicating and supporting them but it's scary it really is and just you know you're in the fight for your life and as Lynn said before don't wait like I suggest anyone that has an epilepsy diagnosis research cannabis of research of pharmaceuticals there none and have the conversation with your doctor because doing it solo is scary it's just not okay it's not sensible it's not practical and you don't want to make a child or your son or daughter worse you want to save that life thank you thank you next up we've got Michael Michael has a story to tell and I'll let him do just that thank you I'm gonna stand up because I need to see the images behind me because I'm gonna talk to them okay I'm going to talk about three different things one is my own journey the second one is to the community of nebadon and the third one might be about some knowledge that we may be severely lacking I in May 2014 was diagnosed with a squamous cell carcinoma with top of my forehead here a little red spot and the doctor put little tube in there did a biopsy it came back a squamous cell carcinoma and then a couple of months later they gave me the Voldemort mark there the zero mark in plastic oncology and took it out by the time he did the biopsy it would have been about you know four mil in size when they operated it was about 25 mil but very aggressive after it was cut into for the biopsy so at that time I thought I'd go down that route because I knew that can semen or black souls of evil it had been four years the vets used to have it they can't get any more so I thought well let's cut it out and they cut it out with clear margins I had to go back after six seven weeks I didn't understand why but they said well we want to examine you and see it has any residual effects and I said no it's a very clean word and it's healing up nicely they still insist that I come in which is lucky to some degree I suppose because they palpitated me and found a lump in my lymphatic node in my left of my neck and they started gaining some scans and some poplar sounds and decided that I had cancer in my lymph node they took to Bob's he's did one on the spot and when we went to the lab and then I had to sit down with others and a team of ten oncologists walk around and examined you they looked at your teeth thing stuck tubes in nostrils and and examined everything to see they could see the cancers moved anywhere else and what they don't know some prognosis was so they decided that the best thing for me was to cut me open from my left eye down to my jaw across down negative across my shoulder and take up all the flesh and take out the saliva glands and the lymphatic nodes it cuts through three nerves which means I wouldn't be speaking today I'd have limited use of my left shoulder and the other nay would just give me a general policy around the face and they I said if I do that if I go through that operation what's the procedures it will you'll be impossible for two weeks you'll go home for six weeks while the wounds are healing up they're going to be quite extensive you're gonna look a bit funny because we have tissues gone and then when you're going to come back to hospital and be radiated for six weeks I said if I do all that what's my lifespan they said the average lifespan is five years I said what's the minimum well you know we've had people died two months after the operation so what's the maximum the similar drops off quickly after five years so what do you mean they said well at seven years you've got you know two or three percent is hardly anything so said what you're offering me is death from two months to a is they said yes and we can schedule you in next week now next slide so what I'm gonna go through these slides and I'm gonna warn you they're gonna get worse and they can we can it become very graphic and underneath your seats you might find a wallet bag you might need because I'm told that they're pretty horrific so that's the lump in my left leg they started to grow I decided against all advice including my GP he was a wonderful man that I wouldn't go through the operation the radiation etc because quality of life after operation could be severely bad severely worse than what they imagined because they could have to go back and do more operations or chemo and more radiation so I said they're offering me death I choose life and I've helped that a couple of people before with cancer so I thought arrogant he thought I could take care of this cancer I didn't how aggressive naked head Kansas word so I did everything that people do you know you have wheatgrass you have a highly alkaline diet I was in a far infrared sauna everyday to detox I was eating all the right foods to create alkalinity in my body I was taking all kinds of herbs and supplements I could find out that had evidence-based from around the world you name it I tried it and also knew that with every cancer in people there was an underlying anger that people may not be aware of it but they have a deep-seated anger somewhere so I needed to clean that out as well so I went into a mental discipline to try and be loving to everybody never mind well they may have done him you know at the end I ended up loving Hitler you know just doesn't matter who was mr. heartfelt good thoughts to everybody and when I did that that to me you can see there disappeared overnight almost I had an ultrasound all this is medical records I had an ultrasound a standing ultrasound for my GP to get whatever I wanted to does he wanted to monitor it he was still saying get the operation of it if you can't control so it was out of control was growing and the next day I I got in to the radiologists we've been seeing me regularly for about six months every 3-4 weeks and they looked at it and they said they called another radiologist in and brought up the other slides from previous visits and they said we can't see his scars he had no operation so you've had radiation I said no I've had no radiation nothing he said how'd you fix this I said many with diet they couldn't believe it it's gone except for one little small one that was still there I thought I'll knock that off pretty easily in my arrogance because I've knocked off this bigger one anyway I two months later and things happen in my life that became unpleasant for me and I lost my composure and my happiness and this little formal tumor grew into this one you can see here the next picture and started to open up now in January 2016 I said to my GP I need some stuff that's going to cost me more than I have because I can't work at the moment and that my insurance company tells me there's a small insurance and my super company tells me it's a small amount of super if two doctors scientist our terminal my oncologist that the hospital already set us to my doctor said yes I'll sign that because I know what you're going to get my stock is expensive it must really will help you so here's my signature go see your oncologist so I did and they said they had to look at the foreman they went away for ten months and came back and said you know what we're not gonna sign this I said why just asking for your prognosis in 2014 instead I had six to twelve months to live if I did nothing I've done nothing it's now January 2016 I should already be dead why can't you sign it he said well if we sign this we believe we're going to you know encourage you to seek alternative useless natural therapies and or internet protocols that are absolute not going to work and you're gonna come back to us it's gotta be worse and we're not gonna sign it we think it's immoral to sign up because it's just gonna get Wilson we've contributed it to your demise I said okay so I drove home I rang my GP he was outraged he said come over straight away I came over he then rang up my oncologist who he knows because the kids got the same kindergarten and he said it doesn't matter and they're expletives by my own doctor who is normally very count other doctors it doesn't even matter what Michael uses the money for whether it's for Hooper's of cares it's his money just stick by your prognosis so he beat them down and they said game to come in tomorrow we'll have a look at it again so I went in again and the first time around I had nine oncologists do rounds and examine me this time there were ten and I had to go through the four hour process an e/m they said they can cure me I said well you tell me they years ago cure me wonderful what do you me to do true I'm gonna cut you open from here to here here here here we're gonna be possible for two weeks rainy ain't gonna be a homely gonna be radiated and this time it might be more radiation required I said cure said well the average is five years and we consider five years to be a cure I said what at six years well you know the story you know you you might not make five years so it said a cure to me means I'm not gonna get the same cancer again for the rest of my life oh no no no no no no no no just that you know you might have a few more years so well that's not a cure same story so I said well regardless can you sign this paper to give me a chance because I need some money to get some things that will help me they're all science-based they're all you know nothing airy-fairy and they refused my GP didn't give up he got me on to another specialist who didn't refer me to another hospital and a team of oncologists but this time a professor on the senior people in Queensland at this hospital had written a letter to my GP to letters and went to myself saying that I was engineering my disease so I can get into my super money he said that they would not sign saying I was gonna die even though I'm gonna die he made 22 points of inaccuracy he got my I wish I was as young as he said and he made mistake after mistake he slandered me we said this apparently intelligent gentleman has been CEO of a number of companies as doing the most stupid things using you know in unproven in protocols and and you as a doctor morally a must for being legally going to be in trouble for signing this document you know it was a whole lot of things threatening my doctor and myself and it does a lot more unpleasant than I said he sent a follow-up letter saying the same things because I had to be referred to another bunch of oncologists as to get a second opinion so this would be the third time I'm going through the process at a different Hospital these people were much more professional they were much more sympathetic they want to decide the documents but in Queensland everything that's written about you comes up on the screen and they didn't want to cross this particular professor they said you know he's written this in our community be very bad for us to go against what he said so we're not gonna sign it either so I was sort of stuck and my GP didn't give up at this stage the whole was getting bigger and bigger and yeah and I don't if you can see that they don't want to see it that's probably and he got me onto palliative care and then doctor immediately signed the paperwork saying I wasn't gonna he said the danger do you know what the danger is I said yes that it's gonna eat in my prata dietary and I'm gonna bleed out and die he said as long as you know that I said yes I understand that so I couldn't with all the things I tried halt the progression and it's really frustrating in May 2016 I was lying in bed in the morning I felt a cool comfortable dampness around my neck was of a bandages on there and I touched this blood coming away from there and I went into the bathroom and pulled the bandage off and my throat router is bleeding now so I clamped it down got into emergency and they looked at me looked at this whole maybe another picture because the whole I think it's this size hole that they looked at yeah and they could see into there they could see the artery had been into being been eaten by the cancer and it just deteriorated they got an ENT emergency surgeon to look at me as well and they said if we operate we'll cut the tree or clavicle here but we've got nothing to stitch up to there's nothing I can do with this artery you know if there's it's it's just the cancers right through it and if we operate you're going to bleed out on the table just you won't know what happened you'll just miss pretty I said if I do nothing they said well you've got a few minutes to a few hours to tell your friends and family because any moment now that's just going to burst there's nothing we can do don't laugh don't cough don't move because it's just going to pour out and we'll just put you in a room and they put me in a room with it but a catheter am i right out - give me the needle because when it starts to bleed out they said this is so like easing the anxiety of death so it's like a no death needle and they put me on morphine 520 milligrams of morphine for my weight 540 milligrams is lethal so 520 because they knew I was going to die any minute they weren't too worried about this one it made me comfortable so not to be blamed so I didn't died that night I didn't die the next day and after three days I thought I've had this axe hanging over me I know what people feel like on death row because they're waiting for the distance I'm waiting for the axe to fall and it didn't fall I had a very good palliative senior nurse that because they put a bandage on my on that wound there it wasn't it not adhesive bandage they didn't think they need to use that he's put something on the artery just to stop it unfortunately of course it clots there and you cannot pull it away that there are all these bandages on top and there's bandage underneath they had to try and remove so this poor minutes every day was reducing the size of the shaking hands but she knew she pulled it wrong in and displayed out but after two weeks she got the last piece off great relief to everybody they patched me up every day and after a month I was out of hospital and a friend of mine who's a well-known personality in northern New South Wales there's a new guy I won't mention his name said to me come down stay at my place the energy is fantastic all the organic food he said if you're gonna die die here or you never live here and he had all the black towels ready as when you bleed out the towels the blood towels are the best thing yeah so it doesn't show up as much so he also research he's a scientist and a doctor and a lot of medicine but almost and he researched where you could find the best CBD which is kind of an oil and the best THC and he found a supplier and moment and acquired that and started putting that into me so I started taking drops out at the tongue morning after dinner night so something happened next to this world kept growing and you can see the purple inflammation let's spread down to my chest now I have also seen four other doctors over 32 doctors including the one from a woollen bar that was visiting every ten day and had these wonderful nurses coming out to the house every day to change my bandages that wound every now I had to go to the shower before they came out and tried rinse it which is agony and then they try and clean it which is acne and the morphine of course makes you nauseas constipated and all other kinds of things that makes you pretty dopey and depressed but I noticed this purple area after two months of taking the oils the purple area there underneath the word which had spread down to my chest and stopped spreading and started to recede I started coming back towards the wound and I said to the nurse and the doctor I'm healing they said Michael nobody's ever come back from a fun getting to me like this nobody it's just we were hanging up around the house kitty litter and stockings to absorb the smell of this thing and having to live with it was a pain and luckily the CBD and THC allowed me to sleep at night because otherwise I wouldn't be sleeping so this is the world as big as at God and the inflammation was receding to the wound the wound looks a lot cleaner thank goodness to this nurse and so it took up a large area when it did this doctor came at wrigley said okay this is a huge wound you know it's not that close up naturally or if it does of the huge scarring you won't be able to move your neck so what we want to do is take a piece idea but do and do a skin graft because it's just too big to heal up and I said no he said why not I said well when it heals up and somebody cuddles me they'll be kissing my butt I said that to him as a joke - trying overcome the logic because his logic was this is not going to him properly and I had a feeling it would next one so amazingly enough that wound started to hyper granulate you can see the red areas there so the top left decided to close up and all those red cells there then the bottom right and then the top right and then the bottom left it all started to close up and it closed up from that wood you saw before - nothing in one month which they said that's the top right hand corner in one month I then the doctor organized for me to have blood work a scan and an MRI in case that had gone to my brain they're always very surprised they hadn't gone meza sized the rest of my body which is what they were expecting and it didn't happen so scan became clear the blood work came clear the MRI came clear and sorry well that's the sequence of events I suppose from that idly from that face to that face did that to that little rule down the bottom and so one lift with everything that was it okay so the one right there top right there when it closed up I had that work done and it was all clear except I was sitting in a pretty isolated place and I couldn't drive could hardly walk 20 meters without a wooden stick but I wanted to get back to the Steve had to go back to work and I needed to be amongst family and friends I moved back to Brisbane and what my campaign is now is while I was in UK last year I saw on the news the picture of a baby that had was bright red and crying was a couple of months old it was born with cancer and they were radiating that child almost every day it was an agony and I thought how primitive is this absolutely primitive you know if you use I started researching heavily into CBD and THC and discovered what a lot of doctors don't know is that we have a second endo system endocannabinoid system in our body our body is designed for him it's designed to take hemp seed hemp oil CC biddies there are receptors if I had called CB once in our body CB twos they're all there waiting to have this as a food substance which used to be a long time ago medicinal septums a long time ago and so for certain conditions you need both CBD and THC because this synergistic for some you only need C beneath the Sun THC so now I am campaigning and talking to politicians talking to the media told the doctors and I will be talking back to the oncologists that weren't supportive and their letters are very damning that they sent me in fact it's against the law what they did I want a meeting with them I want them to introduce CBD at least with their keen therapy because it reduces the amount of illness from from the chemotherapy and try to open up their minds if they don't give me that meeting I'll just have the letter of the solicitors and they'll force a meeting and because the hospital be up for a fortune that they don't I'm not interested in suing the hospital I'm interested in getting this stuff into everybody's medical cabinet CB needs so house yes TAC it take to me drop something off your face did you do the right amount of drops you'll work it off your face and you know so anybody wants to get off their face that they can go anywhere down the road and get some popular smoker so what the hell why not give the CBD and the THC to the people who need it without making them criminals so it's an international law that says international law says everybody's allowed to take the medication of their choosing a metal what it is that's international law a lot of countries don't accept it Australian out Judah Lucy and her husband have got Lucy Haslam has not got dad's law in place federally but they FBI I'm going to check out whether you're using cannabis or marijuana it's down to the states so one state I can take what I want completely legally another state partially another state okay of course a CT for my own use I can do it as well in other states you're a criminal which is ridiculous because you want to save your life of yourself your family or friends so from my own experience now I'm taking too long I'm going towards the end like I was really close to the Welbeck so the idea is that I wanted to think the residents of nimbin because this community have kept the plants growing regardless of what's being done to what's been flooded for so many decades and without nimbin I don't think we'd be even where we are now today with CBD and THC so the community limit in some ways that saved my life and I thank you for that well they regardless of who using it for part of a middle-school purpose you've kept it going and thinking thank you [Applause] Michael whether we've been back to those doctors that were diagnosing him and telling him that there was nothing for him except radiation it's amazing how other wise intelligent men and women can turn their back on something that's in front of them and I remember saying to professor Thompson in Sydney when I showed him a photograph of a woman who had a lump on her breast and she was told that she had to buy the surgeon she had to take a breast off and he said you can't be too careful we better take both breasts off these bastards get paid by the chop and she decided not to go she had two weeks before she was due to go in she heard about black salvo Kenema soul she put that on this spot on this lump on her breast underneath the skin you could see the red tracers where the black self had actually gone out and found the satellite cells doc there's a good idea they just cut around at my hope they get it this went down and found the satellite cells brought them back in it killed the Chairman ten days later it came off in the pad with the big slight pink crater and a breast two months later that was a slight discoloration of the skin well I showed a photograph of this one to Professor Thompson at the melanoma unit in Sydney he struts around there like a god I shared a deer mice it doesn't even pick your scientific curiosity that there's something out there can save women's breasts from the knife and his reply was only grabbing and slipping and it's not just yeah and we're up against that because the arrogance of the profession that says it's the only one I think we're seeing that it's not the only one we're seeing there are other ways to deal with it and what they don't want you to do is take responsible responsibility for your own health or the health of your children we've seen here what happens when you do when you mean you've explored all the opportunities in the medical fashion I've had something similar that fungating Jim I had a huge one on my leg and I said oh well that's not gonna get any better at least level we can radiate a little chemotherapy and I said that came home of a way and the radiation Bob came back with some heavies and I said well what are you going to give me another couple of months with a thing like that then palliative care Irishman said well I told him he said they'd be enough to see you soon is that you should look he bought radiation boxer so I either been in the radiation lasted became I lost about 20 minutes radiation came that had to come back with some heavy cellent said oh god over to go down there he said well they had to come up and try and flog their wares it's locked their wares because they've got him they got to try and sell and dumped it on us and I wasn't having any of it that's years ago and recently I've been back with a we need to get a what they call Keith Trudeau for melanomas it was the great drug formula so I'm getting slightly off off the program here but it's the similarities are terrifying when you're up against and for oncologists sitting there well they said I've got the extreme side effects which included collapsed adrenals would throw they reduced the thyroid activity and I said whatever happened to first do no harm that's supposedly what doctors have as their credo first you know how I said you guys may be the smartest guys in the room but you play a very limited game yeah but hey mo therapy and radiation for 35 years there's a little depth South Africa with a bowtie stuppa chemotherapy is virtually useless listen yeah but that doesn't stop the ambassador's perpetrating among all in summary making them as Krugers Rookwood they want to get out of the game what do you think about that he said well I think it's unfortunate we have to do that I said I think it's fracking unconscionable they just put the hitch down before them when I said I see so that's what you're up against when you take on the system but these brave men and women have done that and found a way through the process by finding in their in their hearts the faith that there's something else out there other than what's been on offer I'll stop my rambling and we'll go on now with Michael no we're gonna have Rebecca next up [Applause] a partner of a veteran who deployed to Afghanistan in 2010 and upon return was diagnosed with conversion disorder major depression disorder and post-traumatic stress in the last six to eight months there's been a lot of talk about in the media about veterans and suicide and the one-size-fits-all approach of pharmaceuticals but there's not a great deal of talk about the ripple on family and partners and they caregivers and that's a caregiver I'm often asked the question who cares for the caregiver I don't think that the question is who I think it's watched and I think the answer is cannabis and for me on the days when I have a lot of expectation that I as a carer and as a partner then I'm going to wake up every day coming from a place of love and patience and that doesn't always happen when you have so many other things going on it's so much fear and so much anger and I so I use cannabis to help me get through the day into to come from a place of a lot of patience for my partner so that he can better manage himself I certainly don't just stand for cannabis similar to the one-size-fits-all approach with pharmaceuticals cannabis is not the only thing and so I show you a short video of some of the other things that we've found that have really given Michael and myself a much better quality of life which is priceless [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music] we're Michael's first augmented PTSD it probably wasn't so much of a surprise because I was returned early which I really from Afghanistan with what I needed to control in terms of the actual like what postman stresses little was and all the symptoms behind it and the dramatic effect that had on our lives I had no concept of that in any way shape or form so when I first got back from Afghanistan a lot of my condition was actually physically manifested so I suffered full-body involuntary twitches and then over time as I did it more work with the psychologists the twitches reduced and I was more suffering from the psychological side of PTSD I'd have mood swings aggressive outbursts suicidal tendencies I became an alcoholic and I was prescribed number of medications I withdrew from not just my friends about my family as well the turning point for me was when I really started to notice that the doctors so-called gold standard treatment was making Michaels condition far worse why not almost databases the treatment I was receiving I also gained a lot of weight the medications that I was put put on turn me into a zombie I was barely out of bed by sort of two o'clock in the afternoon and then I just start drinking because I wanted to feel something over the top of this I'm deep feeling which again the alcohol also made me gain weight and really cause tension in the relationship the gold standard treatment I thought was a crap it was not working it made everything in our lives so much more difficult so I decided that I needed to turn to I need to just do things myself I needed to tell myself that I had this and I was able to help Michael and myself and save our relationship the first thing I really turned to was diet and we changed and changed all about eating habits he lost 30 kilos in a space of maybe that three-month attrition and cannabis or medicinal cannabis were the first two things that we started with and that's when I quit all my alcohol and also a lot of my psycho medications and during which time the cannabis actually gave me some form of relief from the withdrawal symptoms of those addictive substances so flirtation with the next modality that we added once we got michael Shank he was solved the very first time which was really interesting because prior to that he was almost Anton saying I'm not paying anyone to lying about tub of water and so to get me in a tank and to see really the transformation in his face after one hour it was incredible you know it was like how much you see me smile for five years no it was he was the old Michael maybe this looked so happy and healthy one errand of thing so in 2013 Michael went on version Shrek in South Australia it's a p2p rehabilitation program designed for veteran run by bit Michael along with eleven other guys a range of culprits when to remove a needle in a week out there the tools the heat of back from the mental tools the people back are amazing does he return - trophy Shrek he said to me I need to get back to so Michael having already been involved with a fundraiser beautiful just like that he was going to take the rain with him race me to the trophy track the very first year who raised $5,000 second year he raised about 12 and a half half a bottle and this year he has enough happy not to attend total Shrek as a world war he's going back to pass his knowledge on to other guys and to me is the most special thing not only thinking about myself because together we have done that I knew all the things that was helping Michael I was seeing the benefits that would help him Michael those other modalities and obviously it helped me to matically had Michael even decide to go nope I don't want to go with your treatment and I'm happy with taking my pills on the same bed every day and drinking a bottle of scotch every night we would not have lasted I'm so grateful so grateful that he trusted me that he wanted to learn early wanted to change he wanted to take control of his wife you don't want to be depressed you certainly didn't really dwell on the pain that he you have experienced or the pain of losing a friend and he certainly didn't want to make losing a friend in vain you know it's like not living his own life to the youth to his potential and he has so much potential having acara has has been massively vital in terms of me coming to where I am now Beck is probably the person that's actually saved my life there we go flotation exercise nutrition everything you use that with another natural modality that resonates with you that you get benefit from it will change your life Thank You Megan to me Ellie would likely said we are you the concept is studying this friend now good thank you next up we've got Michael Lambert now Michael was here also last year and Michael they showed me the beautiful photo of his daughter I don't know whether we have that here to show me I've got it in here mother's okay thanks for coming today I'm a father of an epileptic daughter is five and a half years old and her name's Caitlin and she's been on medical cabinets now for two and a half years and she's doing extremely well on medical cannabis and we've never been helped by the the New South Wales government as much as we've asked for help they've never ever helped us so we helped ourselves and very glad we did as if we'd waited and had more and more seizures that's more and more brain damage but what we first started using was just straight old extract from overseas just regular hip extract we bought it on the Internet it came through we gave it to and it made a massive difference straightaway to her to her quality of life of her seizures and then we've improved on that over time we've added now to the extract we've also added homegrown hash so we could spare regular cannabis and we dry sift it and we also give it THC every day our THC a as well as THC everyday so we just give her to him extracts basically - cannabis extracts one of them Sam one of those regular cannabis and just to give you an idea we're talking about an amount of medicine that would fit on fit on your thumbnail it's a very small amount of medicine let me give their every day twice a day and we can actually make it ourselves at a very low cost so that's what I've been doing I'll be trying to help myself try to avoid illegally importing it and so I illegally grow it and well I've been prosecuted for that and that's great and I've been prosecuted for that and this year I went to my local police and said well you know my daughter's doing epilepsy I'm growing cannabis this year I told the inspector that because I thought I'd better tell them one of the bosses briefs and he has no problem with me grow cannabis he just said if anyone complains we'll come and arrest you okay nobody nobody's complained so that's great so they knew this year that we were growing cannabis and I just had stated the obvious it's attempted murder if you if you come to our house because now they've the recipe once they know of the full case details about catastrophic epilepsy and they know that if they come again they can't play the Nuremberg defense which is I was just following orders that's not a defense they have to consider your medical condition and make the decisions then because they have the choice not to arrest you so all I'm saying to all the families out there is if you want to help yourself do it grow it don't wait for the government to help you because they never will break the law grow it and it may be if you can't grow it yourself find someone who can grow up for you and just take action to protect yourself and your family now you've recently heard that a great countless fast track to medical cannabis into Australia and I found it on the website and I clicked on the links they were trying to hide it from me but I found it two days after they released it and I reckon braggart told him what a great guy he was actually got straight through went straight through to his office can't believe it someone answered hi Ben how you going thanks for medical cannabis it's only a hundred and forty dollars a day that is just that just tell grant how much I appreciate him getting in this cannabis that we can't afford the only other problem is it's not the medicine we using it's just a single CBD product and we're using a whole hip extract and hash so one great managed to deliver around about 1% of the medical cannabis that people might need at an incredibly high price when I say incredibly high 25 ml bottle is eight hundred and seventy five dollars I'm not getting it that's true eight hundred and seventy five dollars from tilray it's a hundred and forty dollars a day for her dose and that is five to ten times more than just illegally aboard from overseas anyway so it's an absolute joke and you can make your own medicine raw cannabis is very good for you and even cooked and smoked and all the rest there's a whole range of medicines out there and Jenny Jenny is all cooked versions of Medicine where I'm using all raw versions of the medicine but it's all medicine and just find the one that works for you so I just want to say my beautiful five and a half year old daughter who has catastrophic epilepsy well guess what it's nothing wrong with that she's at school she's learning a hell of a lot now she might take Vegemite cannabis but who wouldn't you look illegally well darling why are you having a seizure why have you stopped going a hospital by 90% since you've been on dangerous medical cannabis I mean our doctors will not write us a script we've got a script once for a schedule for you won't write it again because they they did they got it wrong they won't buy us a schedule eight script so all cannabis for us as my daughter you said you're nine illegal and we've got no problems with that we'll keep backing the law to save our daughter's life so thanks [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you Michael and now that leads to Wigan you get it where do you get it Jenny Helen is a compassionate supplier I'll let you tell the story if I can speak now after everybody else thank you very much I don't usually cry in public I like don't like to show you weakness in front of this government but unfortunately you guys all got me thank you very much thank you for letting me be here I think the message I'm trying to get across today is don't wait which is the same thing that everybody else is saying don't wait it doesn't matter that it's illegal you're saving somebody's life it doesn't matter what you're treating whether it be cancer or epilepsy MS PTSD or whatever it is don't wait because our lives are important and they're sacred and we don't get a second chance once they go on they are gone and I've seen too many people die very recently and also at the time that I've been doing this so I'll just recap for those of you who don't know me my name is Jenny Hallam I've been in the news quite a bit recently I think I think everyone's getting a bit sick of seeing my face I know I am but unfortunately we have to use whatever media we can and try and push this through because education is the key to this we need to educate all of the public I mean we have a great cannabis community that knows a lot but unfortunately that isn't going to get it done we need every single person in Australia knowing about the endocannabinoid system and how it works we want it to be just second nature we don't want it to be something that people go above what the N don't want and it goes what and it does what we want people to go on you know kind of a noise system here whatever you know that's that's what we want let's go to be our own so it means educating everybody my story started when I was 20 years old I was enrolled in a car accident I've actually had five over the years I'm not too bad driver then none of them were my fault Oh be read to twice while stationary here on the side hit from the front and I've also had a 40-foot pine tree drop on top of my car while I was driving along which has left me with a serious pain condition body-wide pain condition and nerve damage so my resting pain level is probably about a six out of ten I'm on an average day so I was on morphine for probably about 15 years and oxycontin and the usual crap injections of pethidine and then just recently lyrica that wonderful drug there okay anyway so I was getting sicker and sicker I got to an 238 kilos my doctor said you're gonna die your organs are about to shut down there's nothing we can do the stress and the pain everything just swore away at your body and just left nothing left nothing behind so you can't eat you can't sleep you're nauseous all the time if you do you vomit you just feel horrific just horrible and a lot of people don't realize that pain can do that just paying alone can kill you and those drugs can kill you as well the morphine does horrific things to you you know people think it's helping them they think it's helping the pain but actually it damages your pain receptors and causes more pain after time a lot of people don't realize that morphine they sort of you know a lot of people are scared to go off the morphine but please get off of it it's a dangerous horrific drug my side effects were really bad they could never actually give me more than 30 milligrams twice a day of slow release because any more than that and I would rip my skin off literally rip my skin off because the itching was just so bad and I would try and control it during the day by taking my mind off of and I would just rock constantly just to try and stop from ripping my skin off basically and but at night you couldn't and in my sleep I would scratch and I would wake up and I would people eating all over with it just because you couldn't stop and but that was the only thing that was working the morphine was the only thing that helped with Peyman and then some friends came over it was like to the point where like that was it I was gonna die we didn't know what else to do and so friends came over and just said hey have a smoke in this it'll make you feel better and that was just smoking cannabis at the time and I thought okay well well nothing else is working minds people to go and I'd smoke till I was younger so you it was okay I wasn't gonna kill me so I thought well you know don't nothing worse to lose now so I just had a smoker cannabis at the time and instantly I felt better instantly well I could not believe how quickly it worked instantly the nauseous the the nauseous feelings went away and I ate a meal for the first time that day a full meal and actually kept it down and that night I slept and they left some behind because they said I said you know you want some more later and I left some behind and so that no I had a little bit more and had a sleep in the next morning why she wasn't it was probably later the next day that I had a little bit more and and I got better well I started to get better I started to put on weight again and I've got better and better and I got a job and I started working the doctor said well you're never gonna work again yeah [ __ ] so I got a job and I started working and I proved them wrong and that was just smoking cannabis at the time and then I found out about the whole oil thing and I found out through the amazing absolutely amazing Tony Mayer it was probably about 10 or 15 years ago and I saw an article about him and I thought wow this guy is amazing well I didn't realize you could do that and I contacted him and he spoke to me over email and this was right at the beginning and I think he had time to spent to be with him and he spoke to me about it he said look I can't help you personally but make it yourself it's easy and what okay no worries and it took me a while to do it taught me a look into one to do it but but eventually I did and some other mates sort of gave me some help and suggested a few things and and so within five months I went off all my father's pharmaceutical medication medications so the lyrica was gone the morphine was gone and the oxycontin was gone and I was just using cannabis oil and I actually got down to actually just using cannabis oil about every second day I wasn't even using it every day so and I went off my antidepressants as well and I got better and better and I just thought this is amazing and I put on a good amount of weight and I was healthy and I was happy and and everyone started noticing and they started saying well what are you doing and I say well I'm using cannabis oil I'm like oh but isn't that illegal and say yeah but I'm alive only because I wouldn't have been if I hadn't think I would have been dead so I'd rather be illegally alive rather than legally dead so and they also went on hey yeah that that's true yeah it's smart too so anyway so so then other people would say well can I have some I know I had like crap please I'll go I had a fair bit so I said yeah right so gave it to a friend and then another friend and another friend and then they all got better and then their mate said hey what are you doing and then they would say the same thing to them and so word of mouth spread and it sort of got a little bit out of control so we'll get back to the story of January this year I was probably helping about a hundred and twenty people at the time and police came to my home and they walked to the door and they said we've got a warrant to search the house and I said okay then but before you come in I need to let you know that there is cannabis and cannabis oil on the premises and if you take anything today when Mason is being used to help people that are sick and dying and anything you take today could result in somebody's death and they said okay then and they walked in the house and they took that kind of a soil and they talked the cannabis and it did result in somebody's death a week ago one of my close friends actually died and that was her oil that was supposed to go to her that day and it was probably a delay of about 3 to 4 weeks before I forget more to her and that was just too much and and she didn't make it but she did have a peaceful death a beautiful death which she wouldn't have had on more thing and so I'm grateful for that but it wasn't good enough and so I blame those police that day and what they're doing is illegal what they're doing is criminal by taking away medicine that's healing people when doctors sends you home and they tell you that there's nothing else that's gonna work for you you're going to die so go home and spend time and your family get your things in order you know spending time quality time right Oh quality time on their drugs on morphine means just so spaced out off their faces that they don't but don't they can't interact with you you know they just lie there vegetables in the bed you know they don't have quality of life before they die quality of life for people that are dying with cannabis oil means they lie there they're happy they're healthy they're not healthy but they're there as healthy as they can be in that situation they can react with their families and they can spend time with their families and actually extends their lives even if we can't get rid of the cancers it can extend their lives and that time is precious it give some time to spend with their families to talk to their families to organize them you know organize their affairs and we need to give them some quality of life at the end there so it doesn't matter what we're trying to do it whether it be trying to help ever let's see whether it be trying to save somebody with cancer whether it be trying to give them just palliative care at the end cannabis oil works we know that and we have to fight for it you know but there's a lot of people that are hiding you know that are using cannabis and they're finding oh sorry hiding and we've got to stop doing that we've got to stop being embarrassed you know we have this spirits that I call you wearing using cannabis or you know we're stoners we're stupid you know and there's how we get treated we're stoners we're stupid we're not stupid there is a lot of really highly intelligent people that use and support cannabis highly intelligent extremely smart you know compassionate wonderful people they use cannabis and a lot of them are hiding because they're scared of what other people are going to say they scare they're going to lose their jobs or this fear that their family or their friends are gonna say oh no you're just a STONER and we've got to stop this you know we've got to stop this why is it okay for people to get high from alcohol but it's not okay for people to get high from cannabis what is the difference why is it okay that we're allowed to smoke cigarettes that all basically they do is poison their bodies and that's okay the government allows that but they won't allow us to have a plant that is saving our lives there is something really wrong with this and we have to stop accepting it and say oh yeah that's what the lore is [ __ ] oh [ __ ] it's not good enough and unless everybody starts standing up and fighting for it we're never going to get it we're going to get this pharmaceutical crap version that they're trying to push down our throats and I'm sorry but that it's not acceptable we need whole plant medicine and we need homegrown we need access to homegrown because that's the only way that the average person is going to be able to afford it like Michael was saying the tilray product is expensive the product that's just come in from Canada many can I think this one is the one that Sam just come in 3w a Steve P one of the people that I've been helping he spoke to me the other day now this is going to cost him because the bottles that he would use are three hundred and sixty-five dollars for an 80 ml bottle and he would go through an 80 ml bottle in four days okay so how is the average person going to afford that it's not going to be on the PBS they've told us that not no PBS right the government isn't going to cover it so they're they're going to give it to us but no they're not going to help us with it you know if this carrot that they keep dangling in front of us this you know medicinal cannabis is available it's not available stop believing it all right until it's in your hand and you're using it and you're better from it and it's a good product it's not available so we have to fight until that moment so all these people up here that have come out and told their stories this is what we need we need more people like you to have more advice to do that we need more people out there that are hiding it to come forward and say yes we're using it and we're not going to be scared anymore you know in Queensland this whole thing saying the children under 25 should not use THC that is absolutely ridiculous that means children will die children won't sue Lee people die children like Katrina Mosley's daughter Caitlin will die this whole idea of THC being bad I am so sick of this yes you can get high from THC but if you can you can also use THC responsibly and not have any psychoactive effects from it whatsoever if you use a low responsible you can still use THC and not have any effects whatsoever I need to get this across to people this miss misconception that you know that THC is bad and that you will get stoned from it it's not true okay so please let's get this across THC is something that is really important it's really important CBD has its place THC has its place as well but just because you use it does not mean you're going to get stoned so we need to educate we need to get the right information out there we need to stop this [ __ ] this stigma that's there we need to basically get this done in the only way we're going to get it done is for every single person to get up and start fighting for it stop leaving it to all these you know individual families that have put their lives at risk because they have you know all these people that have stood up in the media you know they're basically a massive target now so don'ts don't let these people do it all let's everybody stand up let's everybody do it together he's together we're unstoppable absolutely [Applause] following over there and just to get it indication for you people out there for what you've seen here today is anyone out there prepared to stand up for cannabis oh just a few of you a few more [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you because that's what it's going to take it's going to take you taking the fear out of the situation and supporting people like this who are living with the benefits of cannabis oil and as I said earlier it's a criminal conspiracy that's not allowing it to be legally available I heard that Norfolk Island has been suspended to Australia it was a sovereign country now it's part of Australia I heard there's a consortium of the lawyers doctors who are police probably all and politicians all included who are growing huge sways of cannabis on Norfolk Island so that when it does become legal they'll be part of the big pharma conspiracy now that's only hearsay but a sense that makes a lot of sense to me based on the skullduggery simplicity that goes on where anything that's beneficial to the community is not owned by big pharma so please help me thank these people let me read their names first of all it's Leonard Malkin they son from Tasmania we've got Michael next door to them Michael stupid then with I've got Michelle next door then we've got Carol and then we've got Michael and then we've got to extend the Jenny ante and then last but not least we've got Rebecca would you please [Applause] we've got a couple of Raving mics down there I'm sure some of you will have questions for our panel just before we do that sometimes they're often forgotten but Stewart over there on the desk wolf aziz security pen show and Bob are on camera so please give them a hand - okay questions from the audience I say that wrong questions from the yeah we had one just heard this for the first time spent ten years of these team or but my feeling is that okay clearly there's something jointly wrong in the legal system that the management system of the whole planet to have such a beneficial thing illegal and I'm just I guess wanting to ask if there is a feeling amongst the people here that there are various other things their financial system for his other aspects the education system that all totally wrong and must be fixed that we have to stand up and fix ourselves we'll take that as a comment thanks for that but we want to and you're right we all need to be part of that change but where we're dealing with cannabis Hall today and would be good if we could just stick to that but thanks for you stable comment anyone else hey hey guys I just got a question of what you guys think because of your personal experiences when it comes to celebrities in pop culture and Australian media that do smoke weed they'd say it on their you know their podcasts or their they say to their friends or you can see them backstage doing these things whether they're bands comedians media personalities that don't tell anyone that they smoke weed for fear of you know a conviction which might be you know 100 although I know something silly like that do you think maybe they should listen to your stories and and I don't know get involved become some sort of because even if a celebrity did get done for some sort of whale or smoking kind of deal it would be high-profile and I that's something that I've been saying for a long time it's time celebrities started to stand up minute because they have a huge following like a fan base that follows them and so we need them to stand up because then their fans will follow you can see over in America when Jennifer Aniston came out and supported it a massive amount of people then because you can support it with cannabis you know because they see the everyday person you know or they're you know the person that they sort of idolize so but yeah I think when we have people like Malcolm Turnbull you know and his wife we shares with farmers pharmaceutical companies that's where a lot of the problem is coming from that's where you know a lot of the blocks are coming from you know we really need to find out who's got money where but yes we need celebrities to support it we need them to stand up and start saying that you know that they use it and that they agree with it and then we'll get a little bit more public support as well and that would help would you everyday uses like ourselves to like tweet them and kind of get them on air so I'd let them know as fans of whoever you like whether yeah you know if you don't stars you know tweet and get on social media and start saying come on supporter we want to hear you talk about it and you know whatever but I mean I know quite a few salaries personally that I know use it that I know supported that have supported me personally and message me privately but will not say anything that's really and it's really frustrating and I'm really annoyed with them and I do let them know how annoyed I didn't rip them so yeah it's something we need hi I'm uh I'm a registered nurse that are not a registered and enrolled nurse tanana Victoria and I've been a nurse here for quite some time and I've just seen a lot of really bad cases of say a mess lots of Parkinson's at the moment I'm working in aged care and a lot of people on Thailand Tigra tall really heavy heavy seizure medications things like that and just a little while ago I saw a video it was called driving with Captain something rather he was it he's the next police captain and it showed that the use of cannabis oil and he had really horribly I don't know if anybody knows like when people have Parkinson's the horrible shakes can't talk lots of different things affecting their own their nervous system and uh yeah I watched this video and I found it pretty hard to believe like within five minutes after taking a couple of drops of the cannabis oil he was talking walking asking the people that they wanted a cup of tea he was insane it was I couldn't believe it really and I just like for any of you who know anything about it to elaborate on Parkinson's my sister looks after a lot of people with dementia and they have a lot of problems including Parkinson's so she has a full business looking after elderly Australians she says whatever you do don't go to a nursing home but um she's finding that keeping them at home the elderly parents at home and using cannabis oil every day is just good for them and I think it's so it's a very big area that elderly Australia should be taking cannabis oil every day even before they get so ill that the family might consider putting them into but yeah we're living longer now endocannabinoid system is not being looked after for longer and longer we're getting more and more damage to our health so if you've got an old earliest alien that you love like my mum and dad they take cannabis oil every day my sisters do the whole family takes it every day really but the older you get I'm 45 now it's time to take cannabis every day and there's a message from a sponsor thanks Mike and just going to the MS thing we know cannabis works for a lot of them neurological diseases and the autoimmune diseases just basically cuz I know what I want to get into the technical side of it and I'd like to explain it I don't know what a lot of the technical side if I don't know just as a layman sort of basic stuff basically cannabis oil helps to stop the swelling so it reduces our swelling on the brain it reduces the swelling in the body and that's why it works for a lot of the epilepsies and that's what I find with all over the kids I'm helping with the epilepsy as well it's not only does it stops the seizures seizures but it brings the children back it wakes them up so it brings their personalities back it makes them able to function again it makes them able to go to school again you know to interact with their families and one of the most common things are comments that I get from family of kids these kids with epilepsy is thank you for giving me my child back I've had drawings from little kids saying thank you for giving me my little brother back you know this is what it does it doesn't just stop the seizures it reduces the swelling it brings the children back and so that's what it does with a lot of these neurological diseases I think it just reduces the swelling on the brain and just basically you know helps but it doesn't stop shaking Parkinson's you know helps Parkinson's helps MS stiff person syndrome identically you know things that basically doctors have said before that nothing else works and they give them these horrific drugs that don't do anything okay thank you okay we have only good time for one more question young lady down the front here is there a microphone in the vicinity unfortunately we have to make this the last question but the panel will be around and I'm sure they'll be only too happy to answer your questions personally after this thank you really do change lives as you all know and one of the comments was that to get people more people to share their lived experiences to help you know raise awareness and all of the issues but what platform because I can see that some of you have gone directly to the media and others have produced you know films to share this lived experiences but is there a platform where anyone that's sitting here that's wanting to be participate and agrees that sharing their story is is vital well how can they do it where should they go should they go to the Wounded Warrior website or whose wish where the good place for them to start to share their stories might suggest you write to your local politicians the Minister for Health just spend a couple of hours writing letters they like letters and emails they can brush the letters are something physical they have to look at it comes through your local police anyone you can think of and so that wouldn't be my take on it just send letters out because you must lift the consciousness around this issue and at the moment the drug companies have got control of the consciousness pun intended facilities which are the media so it has to come from you the individuals and know that you've seen this you're informed so now that you're informed you can get active you can do it in whatever way you choose to tell your friends but get those levers out there anyone else and I think everything you've said is absolutely right do all of the above do all of the above but a couple couple of points I want to make and responding to the gentlemen up the back you know a lot of people here believe that cannabis should be available to everyone and I'm not going to argue with that there is a problem with mixing up the messages between that access and medicinal cannabis I mean the government actually does believe that the medicinal cannabis movement is just a way to try and legalize marijuana so it's a difficult one but we've got to be aware of that I do think that while we can all do individual things there's got to be some way of rewriting some way of uniting I'm not sure what that way is yeah maybe some of the people here can have some discussion about it they needs to be a forum and it also needs to have some incredible people on it I mean I said I walk a fine line but you need more people like me that actually come from those federal government committees and and so on more people like me that can be the interface because you know sometimes I go to meetings and people you know they're just so far removed from these from the reality here that we've got to work on that epilepsy action and a very newly formed medicinal cannabis Council are about to launch a podcast series on medicinal cannabis and we'll be launching it in June June July I'm gonna think about whether or not we can get some sort of a forum or shared space where people can share as well thank you Joe use your imagination folks you know you've been can I just ask for a show of hands if you've been affected by what you've seen here today okay well then once you're informed there is a responsibility associated with that it's not going to cost you to accost them but they need to be a constant with the truth the reality of what you've seen here today because it's not getting out through other forms of media so please take that responsibility and work with it it's been a again another informative and heartfelt session for me I think you've all enjoyed it too all those have put it together Michael baldest and all those warriors who've been fighting for years to get cannabis oil available for those who need it a big hand to them and yourselves on the panel Thanks [Applause] there's a quick comment just before we close for any information any testimonials about medical cannabis and also it's common knowledge now that in hospices pretty much I know in yourself well that they're using medical cannabis for people to have an easier transitional can I ask you just hollered from those of you with mobile phones that have got a nice section would you like to get your mobile phones yeah for those of you who might want to take that down to give you access to that that medical cannabis users Association Australians online you'll find them inside this face yeah say thank you very much everybody"

BlCvYPJSFA0,Peter Dunne to back first reading of medicinal cannabis bill,2017-07-05T05:55:21Z,the minister responsible for drag reform will give his initial support to a member's bill legalizing medicinal cannabis now just last month Peter Dunne criticized green MP Julian gentes bill saying it was unworkable now well is our political reporter Mae hearin Peter Dunne is sometimes coy about which way he votes but today he was put on the spot and a drug symposium when a political panel was asked to put their hands up if they supported the medicinal cannabis bill in June the associate Health Minister told TV 3 is the nation he had major reservations about the bill saying it was unworkable and changed the whole ballgame in an unintended way but today Mr Dan seed had been talking to Julie and Jinta and he will vote in support of the bill at its first reading there are a lot of things in the bill that would need to be changed before to proceed further but I think it's a useful discussion to have and to see where the Select Committee get so the members bill would make it legal for people suffering from a terminal illness or debilitating condition to use cannabis or cannabis products with the support of a GP it also allows doctors to permit qualifying patients to grow and possess cannabis at the drug symposium and Parliament impedes from the act Green Marti and Labour Party's said they would all support the bill but national MP Chris Bishop says his party hasn't made its mind up yet it's one of those issues where we do want to have a good discussion about it as a caucus we may decide to have it as a conscience vote we're in peas can vote individually we may also decide to have it as a party vote where the National Party takes a party position so we haven't had that process based discussion we also haven't had the substantive discussion the greens co-leader Metiria Turei wants the legalization to go further than medicinal cannabis New Zealanders adults should be free to grow their pot to consume they could pot and to share it with their friends it is effectively making legal now what people do now every day the Maori Party co-leader Marama Fox sees the policing of drugs as inconsistent I could not get a police officer to come to the school where I found out one young man was selling drugs at the school they didn't even talk to him like what are you going to do and monomyth Locke says this and can assistance II often hurts Maori and Pacific communities as shown by the high representation in prison the system is inherently racist and every time you say that people get very upset with those words but it is and we have to address it and so I don't think the law perpetuates it per se as the implementation in the policing and the general attitude and our nation Peter dances the key to drug law changes as making sure the public is on board there's a general recognition when we've made progress we've got a long way to go and I think the Christian is not so much a radical nature of change but just how you actually move forward and take people with you and you don't end up creating a backlash or moves that on the face of it might make sense and it's suddenly when they happen people say oh my god what was all that about and there was one thing that everyone on the panel agreed on the current prohibition of drugs isn't working in some kind of law reform is needed from Parliament for checkpoint may hereand
eiPbfcZl9xQ,Growing Medical Marijuana,2017-06-22T22:10:40Z,tell me a little bit about what happens in this room in about your job sure my name is Chris Brandi berry I'm currently a vegetation manager here at Surrey and where we are right now is the mother group all the plants you see here are mothers all females we keep lights on 24 hours a day seven days a week and that keeps them in a vegetative Lee growing stage no flowers so you know by keeping the mothers healthy we then will take cuttings from these mother plants and root them in an easy poner aeroponics machine you know where they get warm roots and then eventually move into containers and keep going into larger containers until their deal was tall enough and you know a nice of enough shape to then go ahead and move into flower so these actually produce the what people end up kind of using is the product absolutely everything is a female and so the cuttings that we take off these female plants are genetically identical to the mothers they were cut from so we know that when they go in flower they're gonna produce the flower buds which is you know where the medicine is and no pollen no male plants and how delicate are these plants in terms of how closely gave too much for them how close they get too much with the lights and so forth oh sure I mean we do hand watering every single day to meet the individual plants needs on a daily basis and you know a lot of a lot of time goes into you know making sure every plant is as healthy as it can be if there are any issues issues are addressed immediately and you know the goal is to you know keep the plants healthy straight through until they go to flower and then we have you know maximize yields of the flower room

tGg7fh0TAVM,Australia&#39;s Canna Nanna&#39;s,2017-08-16T02:49:38Z,[Music] belinda and i and gail hester had to visit melbourne for an event and on the way there we collected karen from newcastle and she joined the crew and on that first long trip which went for about 11 hours girl uh it was funny it was very yes we did we did we had a very good time anyway karen contacted granny for grass in the united states and i'll let you explain yeah yeah so i contacted the grannies for grass and um they love the work that we're doing here in australia and asked us to be the australian ambassadors for granny sugar yeah which was which was a a huge honor yeah because they're an enormous uh lobby group in the united states and that's what we hope to be here in australia this is why we're starting these stores and going around and trying to educate people not only about the benefits of healthy eating because it was only like 1900 when they discovered scurvy that um they realized that people people were were dying and the mortality rate was up because of malnutrition and we're heading in that same direction now with the um you know going away from organic and fresh foods and and going into sugars and just killers basically yeah there are so many diverse reasons why we came together like this and we are from so many different areas that we cover a huge demographic because we're in it for so many different reasons you know like karen believed that we all need to eat much better than we have been taught to in recent years um but i have my own reasons to be in it gail hester who's of unfortunately not here today yes we're door girl gail began the mcua um after the death of her own daughter sarah was 21 years old and developed bowel cancer the hospital explained that you know they would be able to give her some relief and apparently she died as far from relief as she could possibly get a long painful yeah long painful death yeah exactly thousands of others yeah australians every day and then when gail met a man named craig goodwin who had actually cured himself of bowel cancer she felt urged to start the mcua so that no other families had to go through what she went through losing sarah and not know that there were options available um so that that's the reason why gail started the mcua and um why we all got together basically the government's proposed idea of medicinal cannabis is a very long drawn out process there's still years to wait for the majority of the people it is restricted to isolated cannabis or synthetic synthetic cannabis we are the cannonettas are going for end of prohibition for whole plant cannabis yeah um grow home we need to be able to have home grown yes we do and why should it be and and federally you know why should one person have pain relief in queensland and not in new south wales exactly why should a child be seizure free in queensland and not in new south wales you know and the worst thing about prohibition the worst thing about childhood epilepsy is knowing that the the most successful treatment on the planet to even reverse intractable epilepsy and to stop intractable epilepsy which is non-treatable before now which whole plant is whole plant cannabis the parents could grow it for free in their own backyard children with epilepsy and adults with epilepsy some of them do need specific strains just like people with other diseases need specific strains in order to control their their conditions and you're not going to be able to do that with a standardized medicine so that for all of those people it's going to be a failure in the meantime we need to end prohibition can and nana say no to prohibition we believe that is a basic fundamental human right to eat the plant that was gifted to us from creation withholding this food source from our people is a crime against humanity withholding withholding cannabis at all is a crime against humanity you know they're just they're arresting more and more and more people um i know of at least half a dozen people who are presently just going through bean league courthouse aside from myself and who are all patients now this is becoming ridiculous or illegally healing exactly we're all illegally healing ourselves where mainstream medicine failed let's not forget and they want to punish us for it they want to imprison some people for helping us and it's just it's not right that's ridiculous what you guys are doing actually providing a service that the government hasn't been able to do and you know it's a wonderful wonderful thing and i believe that needs to be celebrated people that have been um out there putting their own lives on the line as you guys have and hundreds of others in this country need to be celebrated not yes criminalized not arrested no not taken or not not be put before a judge no we have we have a job to do it's as simple as that you know like i was put in this position by no director yeah no direct action by myself every step of the way in this has been remarkable yes it has been remarkable and it has been amazing and it has been so surprising it's been a trip hasn't it yes and i've met the most amazing amazing people including youtube yeah bottom line humanitarian food isn't it yes exactly and and you know like before prohibition not only was it a food and a basic food food source for us but it was for all of our animals as well so we were gaining cannabinoids not just through what we ate but in what they ate because you know the chickens were eating hemp seeds and it was you know we were getting higher cannabinoid levels in our eggs and in our meat and in our milk you know all of those were taken away when when prohibition came in so you know like are we fourth generation endocannabinoid deficient and is this going to be the next scurvy yeah you know is this going to be the one where they look you know by the time millions of people die of malnutrition including children exactly um and and and and say oh we got it wrong again you know as they did with cholesterol and uh hosts of others it always seems like too late doesn't it we are an experiment too i mean why remove the most valuable plant on the planet when we know that actually color exists within our own bodies because those two existences gains their money it is all about money every person that that that uses cannabis successfully as a lost customer to big farmers exactly and not just that you know like cannabis can be used to make fuel it can be used to make houses it can be used to make plastic and can be used to make so many things that we can eliminate all of these poisonous chemicals and and whatnot from society and it's sustainable you know like paper for instance it takes how many years to grow enough pulp to make paper and apparently you can do that in like a tenth of the time yeah with um ten times faster yeah yeah it's biodegradable exactly plastic biodegradable um so it's not just about food it's about the entire acceptance of hemp and cannabis whether it be industrially medically or recreationally because let's face it you know we all need recreation to be healthy frowned upon because that is our choice as opposed to things like prescription drugs or alcohol i had to roll a cigarette for a friend a few weeks ago and i was holding it she said i want to take a photo you used to smoke don't be such a you know worse i want to take a photo of you with a cigarette and um it looked like a joint and i and i and i've got the photo and i shared it on facebook and i thought if this was tobacco commercially made tobacco that kills thousands of people every year it would be acceptable for me to be sitting here with this in my hand but if it's a joint i would be classed as a hippie stoner and it's hypocrisy so the urgency is um come on nanas come on pops do your own research learn about the endocannabinoid system learn about the importance of this plant being in your life and in your family's life because your children your future generations are relying on it and take responsibility for your own health and for the health of your family and for the health of your children you know like if you are relying on mainstream medicine to be your saviour their days are over and the longer we go the more we are going to see that that pharmaceutical companies have overrun our medical schools and our whole medical industry and we're just customers we are customers to them they don't want healthy people no so we want an end to prohibition aren't we ladies yes your health is your biggest asset and it's up to you to choose it and you have the choice if you have any symptoms of disease start to eliminate the toxins you're putting in and on your body follow us on facebook at canon and then we have a canon nana's event on the second and the third of september at tugan at the community chugging community center at tugan on nikon remote cooling at a road and it starts at

and evidence behind us and we just want this to finish we need all of the women of ours to start speaking out yeah please mothers grandmothers we and we need the whole community to come together you know whether you whether you are a medical user whether you believe you are a recreational user or whether you're both we all need to come together now and start to support one another against them instead of allowing them to divide us we don't underestimate you know our intelligence we do believe that there's a bit of a way to go um and that there's still a lot of hard work to be done you know getting communities together and on board around prohibition being the most important thing so it's about education people power and ken and are saying no to prohibition yeah he knows a prohibition our health is our biggest asset and it is easier to prevent to prevent disease and treat it yeah yeah we don't want synthetic we don't want any rate of cannabis we're not whole plant cancer and we want in our backyard we want in the tree choice yeah so thank you all for listening thank you we look forward to um and affordable second of september at turgan the weekend after in newcastle and we look forward to affordable access to whole plant cannabis for you and for all australians and for us now [Music] you
84fXagAkcRQ,HPMQ - Medical Marijuana in Hospice and Palliative Care,2017-05-02T14:56:43Z,[Music] [Music] the presentation is on medical marijuana specifically on developing institutional guidelines for how to use it so medical marijuana is currently legal in 23 States and this continues to evolve with more legislation in other states and this typically in most states means that a provider typically a physician can certify a patient not prescribe but certify which is akin to making a recommendation to the patient that they might benefit from the use of marijuana for a certain qualifying condition and an associated debilitating symptom this means that the patient can obtain certification and typically obtain some variation of a medical marijuana product from a dispensary to use for a condition cancer or ALS or multiple sclerosis and often for symptoms such as pain or spasticity or nausea so the scientific evidence behind the use of marijuana for medical to treat various medical conditions is not very robust and that due to many limitations specifically the legal status of marijuana it remains federally illegal a 2015 systematic review in jama by whiting and others found that there is moderate quality evidence to support the use of marijuana to treat chronic pain particularly neuropathic pain and low low quality evidence to support its use to treat nausea and anorexia so in developing institutional guidelines around the use of medical marijuana it's important to work with your institutional leadership and other stakeholders and also seek support from your general counsel to navigate the details of your own state specific laws to produce a guideline that can be institutionally supported and broadly distributed for four-year institution you [Music] [Music]
tV_fdeveZow,Prof. Raphael Mechoulam - Medical Cannabis &amp; Cancer,2017-04-25T11:40:40Z,now you asked about cancer yeah here it's a I don't find the right word it's a sad situation thousands of patients are using medical cannabis against their cancer and some of them reported it was very well whatever that means there hasn't been a single clinical trial we cannot be noise against any cancer now that's I don't understand I mean it's being used yeah people say that it's effective they're like total evidence but in a clinical trials so people use medical cannabis against cancer without knowing what to do with it do we need a lot of THC do we need a lot of cannabidiol we have done work with one in one of the hospitals as well scare with some of my neighbors that work on cannabis most definitely both THC and CBD and many of the other as I said 200 compounds that are closely related to cannabis act on cancer cells and so so we're working now in mice but there is a difference you mean humans are not mice until it's done in humans we are not there now why put have government's or whoever bodies that do work done anything in cancer they say it's okay for cancer but does it mean it's okay I mean I don't know what it is people want results yes and we don't have any results in humans any explanation for that the answer is we have no explanation why there have been no clinical trials now governments don't usually initiate clinical trials that's true but this is a very special case companies don't do it and we have anecdotal evidence that it so there should be the there should be somebody with somebody maybe our Ministry of Health yeah doing the clinical track how's the impression that the government to certain extent this is good for all governments you can be scared to grasp when Apple separating the illegal use and illegal use know maybe it's political lobbying probably don't they don't understand it so they we are trying now there is a initial clinical trial starting in at Hadassah there are a few initial clinical trial starting in Tel Aviv who found a donor who is going to support a work in in Tel Aviv and glioma and we found we can whatever Roma and there's some other brain tumors and maybe we're going to work on a brain tumor in another hospital but it should not be done in it that a small way it should be done on a major way mean ok spend let's somebody should spend so many millions to find out whether the anecdotal evidence is correct and whether one should use for this type of cancer a certain mixture or one of the compound for another type of cancer another mixture or another pure compound this we should know it we should have known about that 10 years ago maybe we need to get the politicians to watch live doctors and especially the Cinch of you and you never know what could happen after that completely right [Music] you
VqeECOIP99k,"Josh Waldron speaking at the Medical Cannabis Law Reform Rally and March   Brisbane, Australia",2017-11-15T08:38:44Z,eighteen months from stage 40 melanoma with the help of cannabis but also with the help with treatment I bring in Germany I'd like to say that it was the drugs here in Australia that cured me but it wasn't so I went over to my son and you can give you his take on what's going on at the moment everybody's probably got their own story I've got mine I'm not going to share up and I'm going to share some particulars that are probably going to make you want to fight a little bit more for what we honestly deserve and really it's about equality for everybody the worst thing that we're seeing is people passing away without access them not being able to access the medicine in their last days is is something quite quite traumatic obviously if they've been put in hospital that previously been on the medication and then the medical associations and the people empowered are there to tell them no they're not allowed to have those last days with the medicine that's been giving the comfort that has for the last few months of their life so that's that's quite terrifying for for someone to actually face but if we want to talk about the one thing that everybody's had the wool thrown out of their eyes about that's that's the ability to be able to access cannabis medicine in Australia it's it's a fallacy it's a complete fallacy there is no such thing as the ability to be able to access cannabis medicine there is no cannabis medicine in Australia whatsoever if anyone asks you it's your job to tell them cannabis is not legal to me or my sick and dying family that's the that that's it in a package what we want to do and what we could continue to do is do it is is become together in unity we I've seen own I was the person that held the 2014 March in this very place I promised so many people that I've seen pass away in their fight for cannabis medicine with whether it be cancer particular cell disorders even people with heart disorders that we're trying knuckles bleeding to be able to get this this life-saving medicine and they never did they passed away I can't count on the fingers of my body and toes how many people I've seen pass but they tried and yeah I want to thank them for that being back here you know 2014 when I was lost and I will promise that one day we will have legalized cannabis medicine and it's people like yourselves that are standing in front of us that we've got to be thankful for these changes just keep fighting please it's it's more important than you would ever believe every day not to let lose sight of what can be a new future for Australia in in in therapy and thank you for coming today [Applause] you
TUNpCmpApXw,Medicinal Cannabis in Queensland September 2017 Legal Pathways,2017-09-22T05:44:10Z,"g'day I'm Karen haddock Pauline Hanson's one nation candidate for Columbo and the upcoming Queensland state elections here in Australia now when I talk to you today about medicinal cannabis medicinal cannabis might paint a strange picture in your mind and if that's a case well then that's okay but it really doesn't need to what I'm talking about medicinal cannabis I'm talking about things like cannabis oil liquid capsules and vaporized type sprays I'm not talking about smoking and I'm not talking about using a product to get high what we're talking about is actual medicine that can help to treat the body to calm it down from conditions a whole range of conditions that's ever-increasing and ones that are based on pain and they have inflammation things like that is a factor so there's a lot of benefits of medicinal cannabis now it's pretty new in Australia it's only been around about twelve months that we had federal legislation approved medicine medicinal cannabis here in Australia and that federal legislation allows us to cultivate and manufacture now in turns it's been up to the various state governments as to what they want to do in terms of actual supply and distribution so here in Queensland we decided to make a legal pathway now a legal pathway means that if you're suffering from one of the approved conditions on Queensland Health list you can have it it sounds pretty good but if you're not on the list you can't have it so what instead has happened is a little bit of an underground movement has formed where people are self manufacturing and self medicating now these people would much prefer not to spend their time having to do that but to being able to access a legal affordable medicine but it's just not always a case so what can you get medicinal cannabis for well currently in Queensland you can get medicinal cannabis if you're a sufferer of multiple sclerosis if you have epilepsy if you are suffering from chemotherapy induced vomiting and nausea or if you are in palliative care in the final stages of a terminal disease something like cancer or AIDS anything else not approved tough luck can't have it black market or do without you can however there's one exception to it you can in some instances also get approval for pain management but that requires your doctor to do all the coordinating and to lobby for your case individually now top of all that not only do they have to do their own research to get approval to Queensland Health for you individually but they have to also have proven that they've given you everything else first so all the other medications have to have been tried first and found to be unresponsive now that could mean quite a little bit of pharmaceutical product being used by you quite a lot of opiate based medicines possibly used by you and you know if you don't want to feel like a zombie tough luck all right so it's not the be-all and end-all currently our legal pathway is excluding a lot of people who are pretty needy so we still have the situation out there where we've got some mums and dads and other caring people self manufacturing and medicating now these people are getting a lot of grief if they have to go and take their chances in a public hospital and they're found to have been doing that well they're breaking the law they could be arrested they could have their children taken from them it's pretty stressful but what would you do if you can't jump through the hoops to get the medicine and you know it's going to help because the research is now proving it very very effective so we've talked about what medicinal cannabis is it's not going to get you high it's specially made and it's not smoked so it's not going to get that high factor instead what it's going to do is to help you with your pain it's going to relieve your inflammation and it's going to be very successful for a whole range of conditions ever increasing research is just finding more and more applications for medicinal cannabis and a lot of people out there who use the Internet who do their own research because they care are probably aware of how this could be helping them and yet they can't get access to it we need to help these people we need to cut the red tape and we need to get the conditions that can better for them onto the approved list quickly far quicker than is currently happening we also need to make sure that any products we do get are affordable to people it's not much good if nobody can buy it presently we don't have our own manufacture base here in Australia so we're importing it and one recent example I heard recently was a spray type product that costs around $1,500 a bottle and a bottle is expected to last for maybe a month I don't know about you but I certainly couldn't afford that kind of money $1,500 every month Wow on the good side I heard that when Australian manufacturing is online and we can make our own products we should be able to make an equivalent for around about three hundred and fifty dollars a bottle big saving around about 70% pretty exciting stuff clearly you can see we need to get the industry up and going yesterday so the two big things access affordability we need to get people more access to this stuff that can help them for a range of issues not just the fall currently listed research is providing great findings in areas of you name it physical and even mental health conditions things like at Alzheimer's are getting positive responses things like post-traumatic stress disorder positive responses cerebral palsy fantastic responses the range of conditions that we are finding is just growing continually while researchers is being conducted and the state of research here in Australia is actually pretty exciting our universities here in Australia are very very busy doing research rapidly finding exciting things that can benefit our community we need to make sure that those findings are reflected in to availability for people if we don't we're just being cruel one nation knows we need to start putting people before politics we need to limit that red tape so that you can get your quality controlled affordable product now [Music]"

fwgl05KWUNY,Hindrances in Legalizing Medicinal Cannabis,2017-09-18T01:53:58Z,you're listening to health professional radio my name is wayne buckler and joining me today is dr. stuart washer dr. wash is the executive director of listed medical cannabis research companies elder therapeutics he joins us today to talk about medicinal cannabis 101 Stuart welcome to the program thanks Wayne yes medical or medicinal cannabis I think it's all the same to change them but no thanks for having me Wayne it's it's an interesting time in the cannabis field as as you and the sisters would realize we've got legalization of medicinal cannabis now in Australia hmm and which is exciting but of course none of the doctors have been trying to medical school on what you know cannabis medical uses they've only been given cannabis as a nasty thing that they should tell the patients to stop taking say so we're really hitting the ground running trying to do the proper clinical trials and trained doctors out there and get them comfortable with cannabis now it's it's interesting for me at least in the media industry when I take this story which is got cannabis in its title and try and publish it on social media a number of the social media channels will reject it because it's about an illegal drug even even though it's been legalized there's still that significant stigma about it isn't there absolutely with a weird thing there Wayne is actually in the United States they've been using it for over five years medically mmm California and other states but it's still illegal at federal government level in the United States so Australia and Canada are two of the first countries to legalize that federal government level I'd say a big step forward I recently interviewed an accountancy firm in a state in the u.s. that legalized the sale of cannabis and the reason that she was being interviewed the interesting thing was that the shop the business can't open a bank account because that's under federal law and it's illegal under federal law but they can sell cannabis in the state that's legal so she has this role where people bring her in basically a suitcase full of money which she so as to bank on their behalf and pay bills on their behalf because even though it's a legitimate business in that state because of the federal law they can't at the base camp absolute it's absolutely crazy one what we're seeing is you know the United States has led the way really at state level but federal government level I think Australia's far better so what we really need now is the doctors to get on site and learn a little bit about this because of course it's alright for doctor to say look I've done my research on medical cannabis and decided that this is not for you for whatever medical reason that seemed perfectly legitimate but it's not legitimate for a doctor to say look I don't know anything about it so this is not for you so we're really saying to doctors that they have to now learn about this the endocannabinoids systems an old receptor system that sits in the human body and right back to every vertebrate and even sea sponges have an endocannabinoid system so it's an inherent system in the body where there is actually cannabinoids that exist in the human body that bind these receptors and these are just plant based cannabinoids from the cannabis plants which happen to bind those same receptors and do all the good things now to be clear in Australia we're not talking about anyone selling a plastic bag full of green leafy material okay I'm sure that'll always go on but know that it's not the stuff we're looking at for the medical users will be well validated oils and either administered as an oil under the tongue or a gel capsule for pain chronic pain or vaporization of that oil as well but never you know cannabis dried flower that people will be smoked and that'll never be for medical use supplamine that'll stay well within the recreational market and quite a different variety we use here as well we use quite different strains on our creational market and still do you envisage this thing capsules that are available to pharmacists is that is that the path that will go down absolutely yep it'll always require a doctor's script yep and initially from an authorized prescriber or FAS special access scheme be because it's not a registered medicine but then you'll just go down to the pharmacy and fill your script I will open up the safe and where they store the opiate drugs schedule eight drugs this cannabis medicine we stored alongside and the the education of GPS is I guess going to be an ongoing process and and really will rely on GPS wanting to be educated as much as anything I suspect look very much so I know in the problem is the Australian Medical Association that's come out at certain levels and just said I we don't want to hear about this and you know this is dangerous which I don't find acceptable as a scientists and clinicians that really are out there they're trying to look at alternatives for patients the opiates for pain control work in some cases but in other cases they give severe side effects and even death as you'd realize in Europe you know in respiratory failure and they don't work very well for neuropathic pain you know and some of these other nerve base paints so really the cannabis cannabis medicines seem to work very well alongside the opiates and you can use the lower dose of opiates or remove the open completely now Stewart I've been doing my very limited research here and just having a look at some of the conditions that that seem to have been well treated overseas I wonder if you could comment on things like autism and epilepsy and insomnia yeah look things migrated for Zelda therapeutics what we're looking at is areas which aren't clinically validated you know so there's evidence out there in insomnia and eczema and autism that cannabis medicines helped from Canada and Chile and the United States but really more clinical trials in it and that's exactly what solders are doing so in the insomnia side we're really looking for you know something that can give people a good night's sleep and they wake up feeling refreshed so that they've had their proper REM sleep and slow-wave sleep so we're doing a clinical trial here in Australia and one in Chile where we'll be measuring people with a brainwave monitoring when they're on the medicinal cannabis and it'll be a placebo controlled trial up as well you know so they won't to have a placebo effect you know we'll look at that and control the trial properly and in the eczema side it's a topical we're looking at it's got a good anti-inflammatory basis and eczema as you know is a big big problem out there I'm so we'll be doing that trial very soon in Chile as well I'm an autism trial we're looking at in a chile as well where autism has been treated very well with you know this violence and severe anxiety that autistic children get um has been treated with this and it doesn't drug them out they're not high or anything they're actually had a much lower cannabis level than that but it really calms them down and and makes them quite a lot and interactive so they can learn and and develop properly there are interesting examples and I guess there is no quick way to do clinical trials how long do you expect before you'd see results from that so what we'll be doing will be some those clinical trials later this year November December hopefully and it'll take about six months to run those trials they're not big trials they'll have you know tens of patients not hundreds of patients like this more pays to trial and then probably another three months to analyse so we'd expect results before the end of next calendar year that'll let doctors start writing scripts out for those products because under the authorized prescriber model you just have to show clinical evidence of use yes and and there will be some patients for whom that will be life changing I suspect Stewart it's being a pleasure having you with us so once again Stewart it certainly sounds promising in twelve months is not too long to wait for people who have heard you today and are interested in getting in touch with you or you know for that matter who are clinicians and how looking for further evidence is there a website where they can reach out yeah absolutely one so it's triple w dot Zelda therapeutics as one word.com and my email address and phone numbers on the disorder announcements as well on the ASAC please feel free to kind of help me anytime that anyone's interested so that's Selda therapeutics is Z or Z if you're an American Z eld a therapeutics and you can find all the details in those places if you've missed

m6LpzyAb2mE,Q5 - What Does The Future Hold for Medical Cannabis in Australia?,2017-09-06T06:00:25Z,[Music] Australia has been lagging behind in terms of other countries in giving access in license for my use of medical cannabis however there is a lot of anecdotal evidence right here in Australia and overseas as well on use of medical cannabis for you know various disorders including chronic pain cancer and so on now overseas they have been given permission to legally use cannabis for a number of years now and because of that regulated use now there is a lot of evidence for example in countries like Canada for use of medical cannabis to treat various conditions now that evidence is emerging overseas but soon when we do research in Australia we will be collecting evidence here and then you know medical cannabis will become much more acceptable in Australia

RsY8Ik0mDWk,Insight:  Drug deals and medical marijuana - Part II,2017-01-25T09:12:35Z,[Music] welcome back in a moment we'll examine research into the medical uses of marijuana but first here are some other stories to keep an eye on the British Supreme Court has ruled that Prime Minister Theresa May must seek approval from Parliament before the country's formal exit from the EU begins the decision was not expected to hinder the government's deadline to trigger article 50 by the end of March birth rates in China have risen to their highest level in 16 years the increase follows a relaxation the country's strict one-child policy last year of more than 17 million births almost fifty percent had an older sibling and Bernie Ecclestone's 40-year reign as the Formula One CEO has come to an end us giant Liberty Media has finalized its eight billion dollar takeover of the sport 86 year old ecclestone is widely recognized as being instrumental in transforming the sport into a billion-dollar business well back now to our discussion about the legalization of cannabis while very few countries have made it legal for personal use on any large-scale many more now allow it for medical purposes the first country to legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes was Canada back in 2001 since then it's grown to more than 25 countries around the world from North America to Australia cannabis extracts are used to treat chronic pain nausea insomnia and movement disorders associated with diseases such as cancer and Parkinson's the main active ingredient is known as THC it leads to an increase in the brain chemical dopamine and helps with pain relief researchers are looking at another component called CBD to see if it can help treat epilepsy scientists are now conducting clinical trials with marijuana to treat other diseases including hiv/aids as well as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease or to discuss that further I'm joined in the studio by Elias org who is the science and health reporter at the International Business Times and still with it is henry fisher from the policy director and editor at fault first thank you for being with us now this medical research is fascinating in that it's inconclusive there are as many advocates as there are detractors how do we as citizens pick our way through it well it's complicated i mean as you say they are studies that point out that it's positive but I think we can look at large review for example two years ago JAMA which is a really good medical journal looked at a lot of studies that have been published and found conclusive evidence for chronic pain for spasticity so muscle problem in multiple sclerosis and then also sir evidence that was interesting for vomiting and nausea in Kenya therapy so they are for some conditions more robust evidence for others and for these condition for every patient or does it depend on the patient as whether it works or not well no for no not for every patient I mean conditions vary from one patient to another so obviously the effects of marijuana will change from one patient to another but when you know when you have that many patients that can be helped I think it's worth looking at it from a medical point of view again and have they done much research or has there been enough funding for research into any side effects okay we see the the pain relief for you see the increased movement that might be achievable but what about anything else that might be going on at the same time clearly there needs to be more research into the side effects what we can say is when we look at very such that has been done the side effects for these patients are minimal so it's only a small number of patients that will have side effects and that can include a range so it's a for example there's been trials for epilepsy you've mentioned epilepsy in children and four children were very hard to treat epilepsy the drug is helpful but for a number of them they are a number of side effects such as sleepiness such as fatigue such as gastrin guest row and intestinal problems yes so as always and we've just had the conversation about how we shouldn't go to children so maybe the medical specialists and out how to make an exceptional argument aren't they to say actually in this particular use it may have benefits that outweigh yeah and when we're talking about canvas in a medical context then then it's we're talking about a completely different thing to adult recreational use because it's being used as a medicine so in that respect you then talking about it you're talking about it being used for a completely different purpose in this case essentially the the thing that people look for in recreational use the high is in this case an unwanted side effect what you're actually looking for is is the medical use that the medical advantages and it's here where I mean we also got to consider that for these conditions they don't exist in a vacuum so they're also these patients are also potentially being prescribed other drugs that may or may not work that may or may not have severe side effects I mean when you look at chemotherapy for example so one of the clearest indications of where cannabis can be incredibly useful is with nausea and chemotherapy so same thing there you're talking about candidates being used to combat one of the severus side effects from one of the most unpleasant drugs that you can be given yeah as someone suffering from cancer but the corollary to that is in even ameliorating the effects of the cancer drugs you may be doing further harm or do you think the medical science is now convinced that in applying that at the moment to chemotherapy patients for instance they're not doing them any further harm I think the evidence very much heavily weights on the side of the fact that the help that you're giving these patients and that's without ways anyways any negative messages yeah because it under these medical conditions the drugs are administered as a doctor would to a patient it's not simply a matter of getting out of it I think especially when you talk about cancer it outweighs the problems that cancer patients have you know it so they are a number of risks to people that are against usually say you know there's a risk of psychosis or risk of schizophrenia the just of cognitive decline but when you look at cancer patients this are all theoretical risk when you're in pain when you have vomiting nausea the drug helps you know and this Rick these risks are secondary I you mentioned the psychosis in the schizophrenia linkage and that I know has been applied to the recreational use conversation we're having earlier but if that's going to be a consequence of medician medicinal applications we should be concerned about that can we who is it the problem is learning doctors proceed to present papers on both sides of the argument who we're supposed to believe the relative risks of schizophrenia in this case it's far far smaller than the relative risks of the actual condition this person is suffering from so that's your view or do you think that so that and backed up by medical evidence that's the view of the literature that reactor berries I mean just to take another example if you look at neuropathic pain chronic pain so these patients would all turn I'll it alternatively be given huge amounts of prescription opiates which can obviously they have significant side effects they can lead to addiction themselves and and can be far more debilitating than cannabis which which promotes established is it's addictive qualities while potentially there are much dramatically less than the opiate grouped yeah medicines yeah and far more manageable as well okay how do we find our way through deciding then whether to get medicine and where do we get medical uses going because then we seem to be in a chaotic state that around the world various doctors are advocating various applications how do we reach consensus do you think man I think we need more clinical trials but ones we have now are interesting but we need bigger clinical trials we need more patients we need more conditions to be tested so that that's a given now when we look at very positive individual cases when we look at trials I think it's fair to say that for some people it can help and then the problem with medical marijuana is I think it's really on the case by case basis so it's a conversation that you have to have between the patient and the doctor you have to look at the symptoms of a person whether other drugs that you've tried I haven't helped and decide really honor on an individual basis as we have heard Henry getting actually the funding for clinical trials and so and when the legislation around this whole area is unclear or itself a bit of a mess is a problem this is this is one of the biggest challenges and I think this is actually one of the areas of policy which needs to change most urgently because what we're doing in by restricting research into cannabis by leaving cannabis in schedule 1 is you're simply just restricting medical research and that's not good for anyone okay we'll have to leave the conversation and come back and revisit this liars or ugh and Henry Fisher thank you both very much indeed thank you we end with our insight bike this is a little something that we feel you should know and we're talking about researchers at harvard university in the united states and their latest development a potential life-saving robotic sleeve that will provide much-needed support to those people who are suffering from heart failure now this is still in the early stages of development but two sets of silicon will be placed onto the organ surgically as the device expands and contracts it's expected to replicate the action of healthy heart muscle when inflated with pressurized air it can help boost the amount of blood being pumped to the heart the landmark development in heart treatment is likely to transform the lives of millions of patients around the world and that's all from me for now I'm Martin Stanford that was inside [Music] [Music]
JaNiHlnwTuk,Perth Panel Q &amp; A on Medical #Cannabis - when &amp; how can we access it?,2017-09-14T20:09:50Z,[Applause] to the image man what condition what are you as a similar-looking radius oh I need to be switched on I need to be able to think straight and talk straight and so for me cannabis was a last resort as I understood cannabis it mean I was going to be in a position where I couldn't speak properly absolutely which I most didn't know because I didn't know the facts I've got to the point where the pain that I was experiencing in my extremities was just beyond anything I can deal with I've got to the point where I couldn't walk properly I got to the point where I couldn't speak properly and find my words as someone who speaks for a living that becomes very difficult there was a whole bunch of conditions that had gotten to the point where I thought if he gets any worse I'm just gonna be a basket case and it's all downhill from there I just need to become a recluse opponent so at that point I made the decision that I was willing to try anything and stuff the law as far as I was concerned I was like prescribing to myself and therefore I didn't think that you know it was pretty awesome they thought I'd give it a shot using the black market stuff and I won't talk about where it came from or the quality of it or anything else all I can say is that it worked for me it worked well but I was not confident about the source of it was not confident about the cause or the the efficacy the potency or anything else it was just no consistency and that was why when I first discovered the medicinal chemist was being mooted in Australia I decided to jump on there as quickly as I could put whatever effort I could behind it and you can imagine as well for someone who's in the public eye it's quite a dangerous thing to do because you're drawing attention to yourself friend but when I hear stories like these stories it puts lying into insignificance and that's when I realized that as I said before as far as I'm concerned compassionate use of this substance goes well beyond any desire to eliminate when I access oh absolutely it's yeah it's forever I'm gonna keep playing on and on and on it's not on the PBS yet this is sorry I'm just gonna I'm gonna steal the mic just for five seconds at this point in time I am taking thousands of dollars worth of medication each month which is multiple sclerosis medication if I can stop taking some of that stuff and start taking this I'm gonna say of dollars a month and that's just me [Music] the government see that yes I think maybe that is one of the most anticipated yes PMS or forms of epilepsy for some instances of chronic brain and particularly for chemotherapy induced nausea in people with terminal cancer before ones that essentially at the moment I had been actually route probably others I've had one patient is up for PTSD which I'm going to take the follow up on I'll put a brother from the Defense Force I think most of these patients according to the AMA W a few months ago [Music] what are you guys doing described as some carelessness justice at the moment people who are doing it don't want to get inundated and you can understand why the AMA has nationally about 30% of doctors and members of the AMA in this state's a little bit more than that they go to speak for all doctors and his comments in what I say they weren't right because there wasn't evidence that's his view of the world it's about self serving you there are a number of reasons why people might not be prescribing including difficulty of doing it concerns about that all the points I suppose on that slide about issues it's multifactorial the seminars that we actually do so so we are we are doing it it's just yeah there's a growing there is a growing number this is a small amount that some of the the biggest barrier I believe is the government paperwork and it's a statement of what the doctors want to prescribe [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah yeah I mean it's so the technical challenge with any drug around the technical challenge wrong with any drug that's been adjusted like that so it's horribly you think about the breath test model right and saying it's a point oh five but there's a curve that kind of defines what your blood alcohol is and it's all around your impairment there's very little data out there that can be used to build a model like that for this type of product and so the challenge you're going to have we have and we're talking to law enforcement about this is like having how do we deal with this my advice on this might not necessarily run is we definitely do not want to complicate this process that we're doing here we trying to fix that yet and so I believe it will take a similar approach to the rest of them so if I pictures or whatever it is you don't drive when you win you're under the influence of these drugs and that would be the standard I believe and then we work from there can I dress the more practical part of your question and someone in the same position as you I risk arrest for THC on what is a very dodgy test as you will understand the South Australian Parliament had legislation put through just in the past week that will allow police to not follow through if the person stopped for the traffic THC test is a declared and registered medical cannabis user some progress but for you and me and while we were going through two emails to Roger cook when was stating why can't I get access to doctors in Western Australia can give me this and what and the other one was what are they doing to increase the doctors prescribe - my doctor told me that they could become a prescriber but I did mention in both emails to him that I was importing my canvas or through Australia Post and it was unfortunately I don't know what is the coincidence or not three weeks later there was an ad on the television show you posted them on it and they caught 85 different passwords of drugs coming through the post in the Western Australia yeah so I felt given that I will stop you [Applause] [Laughter] too many strong painkillers and I can't see so I should he thinks that I've caught up with me and he said you just have I'll go back to that problem at the picked up one of the pointer coat prescribers 'but why some other medications he medications and even include some the opiates authorized that authorized drugs or schedule a drugs need to be initiated by a specialist that specialist can then nominate a GP as a co prescriber so you can't go DGP say that i have a script if you've been to the specialist who city s you can be approved for this then they can nominate the GP to the adieu continuation scripts you onething constantly going back to the specialist pieces will have to be our last question because it's getting very close to closing time what we are finding these specialist especially neurologists and playing specialists there's a really long waiting times and in a lot of cases dot doctors or two-piece will drive this process patients that are chronically you'll see their their GP s-- okay weekly basis and then we'll place to monitor afterwards so what if you coming through they drugged me they getting sonic jig things have a list of specialists and destruction of a simple I've been named as you mentioned before as well and also it bakes produces those produces can only get production to enemies its [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause]
cjgcy9icVSA,"Smoking Joe speaking at the Medical Cannabis Law Reform Rally and March - Brisbane, Australia",2017-11-15T08:52:44Z,and what's your name this is smoking Joe you do know we have at least several car loads over there so we need to talk but it's enough okay he's smoking go telling you his story it gives me great joy to see so many courageous caring compassionate people here who have the courage to stand up against this callous criminal governments who are withholding this natural medicine from the people that need it can you make some noise if you know that cannabis cures cancer can you make some noise if you know that marijuana is the miracle medicine that manages a myriad of maladies but the government wants to keep it illegal or if they say it's legal if they say it's decriminalized they're lying to you they don't want to give the children who need access to this oil the access to it you can't get this legally anywhere you can't go to a doctor anywhere and get a prescription all we want is the right to peacefully use a plant that grows out of the ground but you know what happens anytime peaceful people get together to stand up for their rights a whole bunch of people with guns turn up but we are not afraid because we are in the right we know we're doing the right thing we're standing up for the innocent especially the children who cannot fight for themselves so many different diseases can be cured can be managed can be mitigated can be alleviated by cannabis Alzheimer's dementia cancer diabetes fibromyalgia lupus I could go on and on and on all day and I don't want to go on to them but dr. Deb and our other lovely lady speakers have touched on the point that we go keep your running around in circles they don't care they know that cannabis cures they know that they are keeping people sick by keeping it illegal but they're doing this on purpose so I don't say we need a new government I say we don't need any government to tell us what to do the government has no right to tax control or regulate cannabis the government has no right to tax control or regulate anyone or anything and I say this to the faces of the pot-bellied pencil-necked propaganda pushing police puppets in our presence thank you so much keep fighting because we have the power of love on our side the power of peace will prevail the power of truth will triumph and the power of love will lead us to victory thank you [Applause] you
4r6y-IFHy3M,"Green Crush with Alan Park - Rhys Cohen Interview - Director, Cannabis Consulting Australia",2017-12-06T01:06:01Z,"yes we can hear you now okay great fantastic Rhys Cohen from Australia it's already it's already Sunday morning or something for you how far apart are we in time fantastic okay Risa let me tell you something you you were a young boy at some point you never heard of cannabis and eventually you found out about it tell us about how that happened oh gee I guess my my indoctrination into cannabis was pretty similar through high school as most young Australians would have come across it it's pretty common over here I mentioned it be to be similar to to how things happen in Canada but you know beyond beyond um sort of social experience my sort of real curiosity be a cannabis came when I was a young undergrad student and I was really keen to find out that yes how the social coordination happens between illicit cultivation and illicit consumption and you know how price movements affect that I'm obviously a huge nerd as you can tell and I saw I ended up doing my honours thesis on the legalization of cannabis in America in 2015 that's sort of when I really got to grips with the issue and where did you have that thesis in which school was it alright that was the department of political economy at the University of Sydney okay yeah which is my alma mater and what was the reaction to that paper from your futures and your instructors yeah well I mean I I happened to be lucky to be to be studying in an incredibly left-wing and open-minded department which was handy but people were skeptical you know I got a few chuckles got a few laughs but I'm not quite at a stage where I can say who's laughing now but you know maybe next year so you had to weather the storm have a little bit of criticism as many as almost three years ago yeah it's been a while a little bit of criticism I mean I've been quite lucky in that I've been I've had the support of my family through my involvement with the with medical cannabis in Australia and I think I think it's starting to be taking a lot more seriously now when it first started I mean a good a good sort of litmus test is how taxi drivers react to to your job and so what you do I find that's like generally a good barometer of like our society's going with a certainty what do they say when was a taxi drivers video well you know couple years ago was oh really so like you're a dealer and and nowadays it's more like oh yeah I heard about that you know that's the kids who have the epilepsy right so you know we're getting minute piece by piece once the cab drivers figure it out that's everybody knows it that's it yeah yeah yeah okay so tell us about can ten the medicinal can't this and you're gonna have to go slowly because a lot of people in America and Canada not that we're stupid but we just don't have these kinds of things not to my knowledge anyway this sounds like a very hands-on progressive situations of can tennis two ends cantonment medicinal cannabis Leadership Program what is that who set it up and what do you do and what are its goals yeah well so the Canton so Canton is a company it's originally from Israel Canton Australia is a subsidiary of that and it's a medicinal cannabis company focused on education and training so the medicinal cannabis Leadership Program was the first ever full-scale cannabis education program in Australia that that we put on last September down in Melbourne and it was a four-day seminar series essentially so we had 16 different speakers across talking you know talking across everything from plant botany and cultivation through to chemistry medical science regulation and law and sort of everything in between the science that you've been able to overturn in this effort yes has any of this and I'm thinking you know it's positive signs obviously has any of that contributed do you know in any kind of way to government parsing over that has the government checked that stuff out before they've laid out their new rules and regs but they are doing so now oh yeah so the Australian Government is set itself up basically set up this medical cannabis system in Australia and the premise was that you know we would treat cannabis like any other medicine and we would just listen to the science and if the science said that this is an appropriate medicine then you know it would be made available to those people they quickly realized that actually we don't know a whole lot about cannabis still as far as medical use goes at least not in the ways in which you know we understand other drugs you know medicines and so they have embarked upon a real great program scientific enquiry so there's real large-scale clinical trials happening in Australia at the moment hundreds of millions of dollars worth of medical scientific research going on you know unfortunately a lot of that is is attempting to find out things that are already known in the community like you know hey guess what cannabis helps manage chronic pain you know that's no news to you know to any of us as I'm assuming sure but we've never really like asked that question in a way that would satisfy sort of medical practitioners it but it is considered a medicine hmm and so Julie yeah do you tax it we tax it in the same way that we would tax any other medicine so there aren't any special cannabis specific taxes or anything like that what do you think about this in Canada here we have a tax in Ontario there's there's large profits they've and I'm sure this will spread like wildfire with these pigs at the trough but the taxing at a dollar a gram they're gonna sell it at about a dollar ten dollars or twelve or thirteen dollars a gram or whatever it is and then they're gonna attack one of the one of those dollars is tax so that's four hundred and fifty four dollars a pound tax do you think you have anything like that going on or if you men to clear that hurdle well you know unfortunately Alan if that was all we had to pay we would be very very lucky well what else is know what else you paying well I mean so the the kinds of cannabis medicines that we have available at the moment I mean a patient access in Australia is very restricted still but the products the products that we have available might cost someone ten to thirty thousand dollars a year to maintain a prescription for I'm sorry can you repeat yourself I think you just said it's gonna cost a patient thirty thousand dollars a year to to access yeah that's right yeah how is that well these are highly manufactured and imported pharmaceutical grade cannabis products we're talking like Sativex level pharmaceutical formats essentially is there going to be some kind of funding structure or no public medicine to take the burden off someone spending a two or three thousand dollars a month to get through right yeah well it's it's funny I mean Australia is actually we've got a really really good health system usually and normally medicines don't cost people an arm and a leg in Australia the problem with cannabis is that it it's technically these are unregistered in inverted commas unregistered medicines like you know they're things that we haven't spent ten years doing clinical trials on you know the government hasn't said yes this definitely works but x y&z they're kind of experimental at our training them and babes in the woods with a flashlight exactly we have no idea what's going on is what the government's saying and so normally for a registered medicine for like you know panadol you know some you know antibiotics you can have them on the what's called a pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which is when the government directly subsidizes the costs of particular medicines but you can't do that with cannabis medicines yeah because they hadn't been registered and that's about maybe five to ten years away from happening so in the meantime yeah you're stuck with dirty years sometimes there are some states in Australia that have decided to subsidize these medicines on their own so not relying on the federal government's system that you know some putting their hand in their own back pocket but of course the the only states that are that are prepared to do that are the ones with the most draconian patient access laws because the last thing they want to do is in they're ending up you know spending 30 grand per patient times you know 20,000 patients it reached a huge cost for them so yeah it's a real catch-22 it is I think we should establish a floating island nation called drakonia and just spend all of these idiots over there to regulate themselves to death don't you just go I think you just described Australia actually so oh come on hey I wanted to about Australia I wanted to get into this now now I'm I don't know if you know this or not and it's okay if you don't but Australia has a lot of different let's Kate let's call them natural hazards compared to Canada different ones out of the outback I'm sure you've got all kinds of spiders and weird bugs and reptiles nobody's even heard of or seen and cannabis is very one of the criticisms of it is oh it doesn't work for everything but it does work well for so many things have you had any knowledge or experience on something like a you know some kind of a nasty snake bite venom application or does it have any kind of indication on that front from some of your more funky animals over there oh yeah that's a really interesting question let me think so you're full of horrible things that want to kill you in painful ways that's kind of odd thing luckily anyone's died of snake I'm in Australia since the 80s because if you live in a country full of poisonous things that want to kill you the first thing you do is invest in lots of anti-venom research however one of the leading causes are national cancer and Australia's melanoma cancer because we had really strong Sun we've got a thin I was only a down here and yeah Australians suffering like at extraordinary rates you look like you might be those main sufferers no offense yeah yeah right like I clearly should not be in Australia yeah you look like a fairy Irish guy who never sees Sun at all actually is a big issue over here and one of the research projects that's currently underway at the University of Canberra is researching and you know how we might be able to use cannabis to treat melanoma cancers so I guess in that way cannabis is being explored as as part of a treatment for you know some of the unique Australian conditions maybe not the plants and animals but definitely the the natural environment you know it's fascinating to go down some of these roads in a man with a clear conscience and trying to apply it because you know it's so good for so many different things unlike a lot of medications it's like a one medication that specifically for heart disease and another one is for whatever but that would be pretty cool to find out that we've got another inroad there so tell us about this program who gets into this program where they are able to learn historical cultural legal regulatory commercial all of the aspects in the chemical and agricultural sorry gosh agricultural and chemical aspects is this a school or do people apply for this yeah well it's uh so it's a it's a private enterprise so anyone's you know encouraged to to get in touch in to enroll and to participate I mean it's not it's not an incredibly cheap experience but it is a valuable one and the people that we've had come through so far found a lot of value in it we ran it in partnership with Deakin Co which is like the one of the arms of corporate training arm Deakin University which is a university down in Melbourne so it's it's designed in the same way as an undergrad sort of seminar series might run but it's not an accredited university course yet that's something that's being worked on at the moment okay and how long does it take to complete the course also thieve the one we ran in September was was four it's four days yeah yeah four full days and then a couple of additional events in and around it and then you've got graduates how many people graduated this time did everyone pass oh yeah well it's um we we don't have tests or assessments um but but we had 30 people come through and graduate and yeah 30 happy campers so it was quite an experience you know we had 30 participants and we had 16 facilitators over 4 days so that's incredible that's a great ratio yeah that's the right ratio to have I think I mean I've had some experience teaching teaching undergrads myself and I tell you what you know if you have class sizes that are getting up to where they are now becomes impossible to have a real sort of conversation so keeping it nice and intimate is what we aim for and that's that's a great idea so I'd like to come down there and do it but it's gonna be too far too tight right away so this was your first wave in September that's right that's right yeah yeah and how often are you going to try to do this throughout the course of the years at a once-a-year thing or every few months so we're looking to run another one around March this time in Sydney it's early days I mean the we're trying to grow sort of as the industry's growing at the same time it's it's all very new over here still you know we only had cannabis medical cannabis legalized in February 2016 so you know it really hasn't been that far down the track yet right tell me about you know these practical tools that they learn all of these students these 16 folks and and they are that's gonna help them build different things like commercial projects you say scientific projects so give me an example of one of those like what's a commercial project for example from the ground up like it this is something dreamed up out of nowhere or how would someone take this knowledge and bring it to to the field of you know this this usage yeah okay good question well I mean starting you know an LP in Australia is no small task it's probably a lot a lot harder and more financially costly than in Canada at the moment and one of the things that I mean so I do commercial consulting as well as mine in Bob we've can't end so I speak with a lot of people who who are looking to start plant touching businesses in some way shape or form and the real challenges they have mean besides you know access to capital is is just we're speaking to the right people at the right time and networking so knowing you know who to call on if you need a lawyer knowing you know who to call on if you need to source plant genetics knowing what story if you need sauce plant genetics so like she said it's pretty pretty heavy you know it's just the speed of sourcing plant genetics okay great yeah that makes it yeah and just putting people in making sure that you have a network of people that you can draw on for expertise so we had a few people come through the program who are at the early stages of building their own plant touching companies there are plenty of people from the horticulture and and hydroponic equipment sort of side of things some chemists a GP a few pharmacists a nurse you know so it was quite a diverse group of people and as you know I mean you know people get involved with cannabis for for a whole number of different reasons sure so yeah the idea was to have something that could provide a good a good base level of knowledge to everyone you know for them to go go forward and and do you know do what they want with that knowledge you know whatever that might mean to them well I sure it's always been a goal of mine to get to your your country and I'd love to get down there some time but but since I don't know much about it how do you feel about here in Canada and I guess in the States and all over from where I've read there are a lot of doctors and MDS and nurses as you say on board with this they're they're actively trying to get it going and trying it at different applications and and then there are other doctors who just absolutely refute no that's all nonsense none of that works it's all [ __ ] like my first guy that that you know basically showed me the door to this planet on the way out and I decided he was wrong there's a lot of adopters and they're coming out of the same schools I mean you have to you have to learn how to be a doctor can you understand why it is that some of them are so on board with this and others tell you it's nothing more than you know the wives tale yeah it's funny I think most doctors would start out with with not much knowledge of cannabis because like you say it's not something that's really taught in India in the course of them being trained as a doctor most good doctors are are open-minded about most things and our humble to some extent and are prepared to learn from their patients as well as from from other areas and I think in my experience the difference between a doctor that's that's interested in in exploring cannabis and a doctor that isn't is whether or not they've had a patient who's come to them and shown them you know in the flesh that the cannabis can work you know so I've spoken to doctors who who say you know hey I didn't really think much about cannabis but then one of my patients came in and you know normally their pain is that you know seven out of ten most days and they find it difficult to walk but today you know they walked in and and they were happy and smiling and they said yeah hey guess what like you know I've got some black-market cannabis oil and it's it's changed my life you know and they get to see that in reality I think that's been a real key that's the hands-on thing right that's the hands-on thing because you know what I've got hands on and I got out of this by using it and I used to get really upset and angry of people because of because of another medication I was on and and because because I was so frustrated that people wouldn't believe me while I was telling the truth so in the early days if you countered me I might have been a little more salty than I oughta have been but then I realized later on this is so amazing what's happened to me as I've turned the corner and gotten out of trouble of death wise and been able to maintain and you know recapture a life on this planet I couldn't believe it so I mean I don't blame people anymore I broaden my perspectives as well keeping on using this stuff rod in my perspective you can't expect people to understand this so fully until such as yourself you got your hands right into some educational creative aspect or someone like myself like I really don't expect people to understand it until they've actually you know you don't know what it's like to ride a horse until you have you know what I mean yeah you can now decide it'll tell you as long as you want but it's so great that you're doing this are you aware of um I guess you're aware of Route dr. Raphael masher Lama of Israel yes oh do share some of those who Kenny can you tell me oh we're trying to get a hold of this guy I mean he's been doing this stuff since since I was in diapers and yeah I'm sure he has much to do with any kind of advancement from this I always think of him coming from Israel and you say you're connected in that way so tell us about some of your experiences with him or what he thinks or where you guys are what are you talking about let's see your emails you know well but I've been in occasional contact our colleagues back in Israel work closely with with Professor McCollum in developing some of the educational materials and you know he's he's a bit of an elder statesman over there so you know he's sort of person who will open up big conferences and and be a keynote speaker at various events but I think I think he's in the process is all good academics should be okay so he was the guy that identified THC is a component back in sixty two or three or something and so that's right what's his position personally speaking or from whatever you can glean on on this as a powerful you know medicine like a cancer fighter or another autoimmune disease and a lot of things that trouble folks yeah well I think I think mushy lumps as he says greatest contributions have been the most foundational you know scientific discoveries about here at the endocannabinoids system and to AG and an and of my PhD and that was incredibly groundbreaking stuff that really sets set the scene for the kind of research that's going on at the moment in Israel and around the world so one of his protégées is an academic called dedi maori who's the Hebrew University of Jerusalem I believe I could be wrong could be earther at the Technion but he's another Israeli researcher who is sort of I guess taking on the in the process of taking on Michelle's role as the you know global Israeli scientists and we were lucky enough to have daddy deliver a talk as part of the content program he did it remotely from Israel where he sort of explained his current research which is focused at the moment on cancer and anti-cancer effects of cannabinoids and what's his mom again this doctor yeah David Mei r-e and I are okay in summary yeah because the reason I ask is as enamored as I am with dr. Masur Lama as so happy as I am that he is there and has been doing this work let's get serious he's almost a hundred years old he's he's done a lot of stuff yep he's definitely getting getting up there so we need to we need to make sure he effectively passes the baton of whatever it is he this is a valuable human being and I would hate to see him you know his works to sort of fall by the wayside simply because it wasn't here anymore and you never hear about him in Canada they never they never look him up in the States or England or Ireland when they're looking at the science of it they'll just say well these police officers believe something and they told the politicians who also believe something and they never go to the hard data from people such as this and that's incredible with the political support Canada gives Israel as well so I'm just trying to get past that conundrum yeah yeah well you know I think I think professor mussalam is on the scientific advisory board have been of a Canadian MP so if you wanted to track him down you might do well to do it through that Avenue but I mean what's really exciting about about what's happened in Australia at least since February 2016 is you know between the philanthropists and the government we we've put you know maybe close to 50 million dollars into cannabis medical cannabis research just in the last couple of years and got research programs happening it may be you know half a dozen or a dozen universities across the country now and what that's doing is giving a lot of Australian scientists some real hands-on experience researching cannabis and I think you know that combined with the efforts still coming out of Israel combined with you know the kinds of amazing stuff we see coming out of North America I mean it's it's a bit different because I think you know especially in the States right like you can basically do whatever you want as far as you know scientific research goes so long as you're happy to to have it sort of under the under the the the shadow of federal prohibition you know but in Australia and in Canada and other places you can sort of do it in the light of day which is a bit a bit nicer yeah well they just do they just made a big deal about dronabinol which is a synthetic cannabis something or other I don't really know what it is yes yeah synthetic THC no I don't know if I trust that or not have you got any information on that over there were you guys with that because they've they've got this synthetic version that obviously isn't as well tested as this other thing that's been kicking around for 5,000 years but they're telling us that it's now gonna be a schedule 2 drug because it will be helpful to people and it won't be as which is to me I don't know if it's disingenuous or not I can't say that I haven't researched it but have you have you got any insight on that fake one yeah well I mean it's it's pretty obscene isn't it that you would say you know dronabinol which is a synthetic version of Delta 9 THC has medical benefits but cannabis which contains Delta 9 THC has no medical it's insured Romania won I mean yeah not that we needed more examples of the ridiculous hypocrisy of us drug policy by you know here's another one right yeah what's what's really interesting about dronabinol and and marinol and like the other single chemical synthetic cannabis medicines is that they fit really really neatly into the existing framework of like how how people do pharmaceutical medicine you know they're single chemical single target they're well known chemically speaking you know you don't have to worry about the entourage effect or you know minor cannabinoids or you know these other things right so they're really attractive to people who are who are most comfortable doing traditional pharmaceutical R&D you know so I just care how comfortable those people are there exactly right yeah I'm with you the thing is that it's actually according to all the evidence that we have at the moment people don't like using synthetic cannabis products or even single single cannabinoid cannabis products you know you take th an isolated THC to manage nausea versus a whole plant extract which includes THC to manage your nausea and so far it seems that patients really don't like the single chemical versions yeah it feels terrible right and you end up usually according to the evidence we have at the moment getting a much better therapeutic outcome with the whole plant products so even though yeah it's easier to do you know traditional pharmaceutical R&D on a single chemical you know you know marinol or whatever dronabinol people don't want it you know it could be this it could be the convulsions or it might be the heart attacks you know that kind of thing that might be a problem there there are yeah it just really messes me up when I'm trying to get past something I take a government-approved item that's gonna bring me down and when when this other stuff is so healthful unavailable so what you take on other countries in the world who's at the forefront I mean Portugal they don't have any laws against it so that's at the forefront we also don't consult them too much when we make laws in Canada but what about Spain and various other countries if you got a read on some of their uh their ways and means regarding this turning point yeah it's interesting I think I think it really depends on on what you desire in in cannabis regulations because I mean clearly you know places like California have excellent patient access like you know anyone you know more soon you know anyone can walk into a store and get cannabis if they want so you know you don't have that Barrett and it's reasonably affordable you know and you don't have that barrier we're great but you know as you know you know in California you know your quality regulations might not be there yet you know as far as you know the specific product labeling there was a report came out recently about the mislabelling of CBD products in North America it seems pretty awful you know so in you know what you gain impatient access you tend to lose out in regulated quality standardized products if you know what I mean so Portugal's super interesting because yeah their drug policy has been really effective not just across cannabis but all drugs right in reducing you know overdose deaths reducing crime and we've actually had quite a few Australian politicians go and visit Portugal to look at to look at their drug policies and they've come back to Australia even some very conservative politicians and said hey I know it's crazy but like we've seen it and it works you know let's have a think about it ok ok stop stop stop I'm afraid that we might actually have some government people in Canada listening and I hate them to get oh IBS going or something with all your backs coming out it's amazing because these people here here it is from 2015 in a US News & World Report that during March of 2015 many young men came to the hospital acting extremely violent and confused they tested positive for what seemed to be cannabis but the the dosages were much higher than anticipated because these kinds of dronabinol and synthetics are higher than that and and they had used the synthetic marijuana there were a hundred and sixty synthetic pot people synthetic pot users a hundred and sixty sent to hospitals in April of 2015 in New York and yeah yeah this is on US News and World Report Alabama public health officials shared that nearly a hundred people had been hospitalized for problems linked to synthetic marijuana just between March and April just in 2015 I don't have any update on that but I'm k2 spice Green Giant this kind of thing bought at certain places cheaply but it's it's it's you know coming from Chinese and Pacific Rim countries and commercial chemistry labs and I really don't understand how how folks can you know put this into the mainstream while they demonize what's obviously natural comas synthetic marijuana products that cause people so much harm like youdescribe usually they don't even have any cannabinoids in like usually they are completely chemically not at all related to cannabis but even in the news they're still called synthetic marijuana yeah because that's how they're marketed to people and they're also marketed on the news I've seen reports before where someone's had an issue and they just come down heavy all another this is a bad time for marijuana look at they're trying to legalize marijuana this is terrible and then you you know at the bottom of the stories like Anna was dronabinol anyway they don't tell me it was the actual bud you know itself yeah you know what's funny is that is that in New Zealand they created a law like to to avoid some of these problems because the problem one of the problems here is that you know you ban you ban a chemical entity and then some clever guy in a lab comes up with a new chemical entity you know that that becomes k2 and it takes six months before that new chemical entity gets banned and you sort of had this lag effect in New Zealand they put a law in place that said okay well we'll slow down and everybody you can't sell any any new chemical entity until we've approved it they sort of reversed it so that sort of put us instead of chasing it afterwards exactly yeah they were like okay blanket prohibition on everything that we haven't said yes to yet if you want to sell it you got to come through us first and we got to test it and make sure it's not you know something awful it's gonna harm people you know which works well for the for the stuff you can buy in stores legally but of course does nothing to effect the black market yeah so give us just before you go give us a few more places that you figure are leading the way I know you've expressed the excitement about Canada's political turn you're I'm a little less enthusiastic than you are but I understand we have geographical a difference of awareness but what what would you say are the top five countries that are the most scientifically ahead of it the most progressive the most law friendly to the user partaker mehta de midi Sunol or otherwise yeah okay well I guess I guess Germany would probably be getting off there I mean it's exciting to see such a huge country especially in you know in Europe take such a huge step towards cannabis legalization I don't know how well it's working at the moment but I but I wish them the very best and I know there's lots of Canadian companies getting involved they're helping them get set up I'm excited that New Zealand is going to probably legalize I don't use cannabis within the next say four or five years what kind of kind of it I don't use recreational okay sure yeah so they had a new prime minister recently and she said that within three years she's gonna hold a referendum on legalizing recreational cannabis that's pretty cool in terms of science yeah Israel is definitely still up there for sure what's been interesting is seeing so many of research collaborations between Australian companies and Chilean and South American growth South American companies okay now yeah that's great Chilean yes so there's one of our big companies over here called oz can they have a partnership with the day of foundation which is a group in Chile and together they're actually cultivating and they're running clinical trials in Chile and you know eventually that's gonna sit in a bleed into the rest of South America there's been some talk recently about Brazil you know moving towards a domestic cultivation which would be pretty huge cuz you know have resilience there are yeah and the geography I mean it's huge you could grow anywhere there there you know you wouldn't have to worry about winter anyplace down there it's basically main for it yeah yeah we're especially you know towards the the west you know near the mountains but I'm really curious to find out more about Mexico's move towards medical cannabis just to me I think globally speaking the real the real tipping point is gonna be when the u.s. makes a move towards legalizing medical or or I don't use cannabis I think that's gonna be huge you know point in our history right are you being attacked by a jumbo jet right now what's going on yeah yes sorry I which has an airport in the city around so okay no problem just checking I wasn't on a district we have Mexico in the south of medical you got Canada in the north without use and medical you got you know all the west coast I think I think that'll finally put enough pressure on on the US federal government to actually do something and when that happens that's when when the global transformation will be I believe oh goodness so we're sitting here waiting for the u.s. to do the right thing and we are you familiar at all with this man by the name of Jeff Sessions I may have come across him once or twice yeah he's the he's Trump's he's the guy that under Trump that wants to shut all of us down somehow that's right yeah yeah well good luck to ya try putting that genie back in the bottle yeah I don't think I hope you could come back on the show sometime Reese it's been a pleasure speaking with you I sure do appreciate the time difference we entertain the notion of pre-recording this because but so glad you're able to get up at 6:00 in the morning oh man I hope you still have a good rest of your day tomorrow while I'm finishing up the yesterday today great many people alibagh happily do it for you so thanks for having me on the show it's been awesome thanks Rhys and once again give us the name of your organization give us them to give us some details on where folks can find you if they're interested in perhaps going there and participating or at least keeping tabs on your developments that are so important to this burgeoning new industry of awareness and thanks a lot yes you can you can check it out at CAA n10 Comden au or you can find me on LinkedIn is probably the easiest place to find me get in touch say hi always happy to have a chat I read you loud and clear alright Rhys well thanks very much and we will get in touch with you again I'm looking forward to seeing how your program of that just went by in September develops and I it brings me a lot of comfort to understand and remember that while I'm in here slinging the muck against these monsters that not everybody's a monster there's a lot of intelligent well appointed researched folks it also shoots down the notion that you know anybody involved in cannabis has nothing to contribute this anxiety this is another myth of theirs that's easily blown up by speaking to a gentleman such as yourself so thanks for presenting yourself for us and we really appreciated your a green crush too kind thanks very much all right take care that's Rhys Coen no longer with us online but with us in spirit and memory and we will definitely be touching down with with his with his program again and trying to understand what's going on there with this fantastic healthful substance but in the meantime before we get back to what I'd like to do next a different little segment that we're going to do or talked about it last week how all of this gets into play in the first place and when I mean that I'm talking about how in Canada specifically and you should listen if it's in the States because these folks were involved in your history as well the Bronfman gang we're going to"

X0yxrrKgEKc,World-first study uses medicinal cannabis to treat insomnia,2018-04-30T04:44:44Z,"This trial is looking at the effects of
medicinal cannabis on the treatment of insomnia. Insomnia is really prevalent in
the population it's the most common sleep disorder insomnia is a difficulty
in getting to sleep or staying asleep or waking up too early and it has an impact
on people's daily functioning or quality of life we know from anecdotal evidence
and also from evidence in other trials for example looking at the use of
cannabis on in treating certain pain conditions that it potentially has side
effects which are sedating so we believe that it may be useful in people who have
difficulty sleeping it's going to be taken under the tongue and it's an oil
formulation and people it's point five of a mill and people will take it
nightly about one hour before they are wanting to go to sleep the trial is a
randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial so
what that means is that we'll be looking at their sleep over baseline two week
period and then they will have the placebo all the active medication for
two weeks and then cross over and have the opposite for two weeks and they
won't be told which is which and us as the investigators won't know either
until the very end when we unwind the trials there are a lot of people who
suffer from insomnia and I mean this is these are the people that are telling us
as well I think there's a lot of people that live with it without seeking help."

to Brisbane unlike Darwin I got uber so I've been a fan for 30 years and most the time I've never seen canvases of Medicine I've seen it as a dangerous recreational highly addictive drug I don't believe that at the moment but the last three years I've been looking at the medical benefits of cannabis and particularly our chronic pain to some patients you may offer a treatment option may not be first-line defense but for some patients it can certainly provide some good benefits and there are a few conditions that available in Australia for medical cannabis but over time I believe price will drop and some of those conditions might be broadened but my journey is from a cannabis sceptic to quite an advocate and as coming from a sceptic point of view I feel that I can educate health professionals that this actually is a treatment option for so many patients financially involved with these companies awesome I've run a retail pharmacy in Western Australia and I was the first quarter of legal medicinal cannabis into Australia and I imported some Canadian product which and what we're talking about tonight but the biggest disclaimer I want to give is I'm not a cannabis user I've never used cannabis medically recreationally spiritually or otherwise and have poison choices beer because it makes my jokes funnier and gives me flawless dance moves also like to think so and some of that hard data I'm going to be presenting tonight compares alcohol versus cannabis Candice fares too gaily not give up drinking anytime soon so it came as great surprise to me that cannabis was widely used in Australia and worldwide pharmacies circa 1930s and it's used for some of the same things we're rediscovering now like childhood epilepsy pain conditions cancer pain and recognize the company names and they have evolved and war from these little companies to what's now Big Pharma who've made their start something cannabis multi-billion dollar companies they no longer sell cannabis but one day they may again so what happened cannabis was banned largely on the basis of the unscientific movie somehow presumes to be talking about later on but there was no scientific basis which they ban cannabis this movie reefer madness proclaimed cannabis turn yearses bond and sex-crazed at the time the American Medical Association spoke out against herb and a lot of health professionals said no me useless is a treatment option by they're overruled by some bureaucrats who wanted to regulate the medicine and the same company same government Department wanting to regulate the cannabis had previously ran the alcohol prohibition in America and they precess if there's not a problem if cannabis both once they've done their their themselves out of a job when they legalized alcohol in 1934 in u.s. it was a different story so they went off to cannabis so the cannabis plant is quite complex and some of our other presenters to be talking about it so I'm speaking the devil but in turn the two main pharmaceutical component which I'll be talking about in a bit more detail tonight that achieve the effect THC is a bit that may get you high and CBD which has got good medicinal benefits without psychotropic effects so there are I think at last count 143 different cannabinoids within the plant there's wax as chlorophyll Zand terpenes but most pharmaceutical products currently contain these two ingredients on the label so THC and CBD but I want to make a display about that in future there may be other cannabinoids listed on the labels so what is THC and CBD THC first up he provides a stimulation to nausea stimulation of appetite and helps nausea in patients this is this is good emotions that require an appetite has the old story that canvas gives you the munchies well the medical terms that can prove to be useful it also acts as a muscle relaxant MS patients and in terms of pain you not only treats the pain but helps a few other associated conditions as well it may cause drowsiness but that may be put benefit particularly in patients without need to get a good night's sleep CBD on the other hand is non psychoactive which is quite fun to know because a lot of the cannabis we did some formulas have got only CV days so just say that canvas gives you high is not exactly true then my patients might be getting such low doses or a CBD only product that Seema needs but a number of properties that they still moment some of the main ones oh it's an anti-anxiety effect and to convulsive they're using it to good effect in epileptic patients but particularly with drug-resistant epilepsy antispasmodic and will help in in pain and mild anti-inflammatory now adverse effects most of these are reversible once he stopped doing cannabis and the idea is people have adverse effects then you lower the dose or withdraw it entirely so most of these are pretty minor the dry mouth right my eyes if there is any psychotropic effects that is seen as a side effect not a knowledge treatment idea form as medicine short-term memory impairment is the big one the elephant in the room is psychotropic effects I'll talk a little bit more about that later so contraindications the main one is patients that have issues of psychosis particularly schizophrenia also other contraindications patients you wouldn't necessarily give cannabis to pregnant or breastfeeding mothers or people with our renal so the Australian government are concerned of addiction so anyone else with any addiction history such as alcohol or drugs this four main drug interactions with cannabis none of them are serious in the case of blood thinners you may need to do regular eye on ours with warfarin and it doesn't mean stopping warfarin or blood thinners you might have to check the levels more chemist has also metabolized by cytochrome p450 so anything else which has been tab alized by this pathway should be used with caution anything that lowers the blood pressure or causes drowsiness once again it doesn't mean reducing way that medication you've made just need to look at reducing the dose somewhat we had one patient on a 20 milligram blood pressure tablet they reduce it down to 10 milligram when they started cannabis so the psychotropic effects the big elephant in the room the object of treating patients is to get help rather than high so the golden rule is to type start low and go slow and titrate the dose up words you may find it useful to give a nighttime dye so if there is slight drowsiness the patient won't get a good night's sleep and wake up with healthy appetite when using it on on children less than 18 particularly air drops isn't epilepsy it is a lot more dangerous for kids to have epilepsy and potential seizures throughout the night than to use cannabis so see there's a lesser of two evils cannabis and driving has been a lot of talk about this and to a certain extent the Australian laws haven't caught up with what's happening as far as patients being able to use cannabis legal medically there's a there's a train of thought that while canvas might appear in someone's bloodstream that may not necessarily be impaired so I've seen some data that shows impairment from cannabis opiates alcohol is one of the worst and even having extra people in the car or talking on a mobile phone it's not seen as ideal so the golden rule is if you're impaired with cannabis not to drive now cannabis differently as far as testing and it varies from state to state for me out there the golden rule of thumb is if you're impaired not to drive for 68 hours later or if you are taking cannabis a lot of the medical professionals may ask the patients to sign a waiver making sure a patient has a cure or a wife already of driving around so I first really became interested in cannabis when I saw some overdose statistics from America what they call the opioid epidemic and almost 20,000 people died in 2013 from pharmaceutical opioids and as a health professional i felt quite responsible i thought you know that it's unacceptable that this many people are dying especially when almost 0 people who died from cannabis we put an australian dollar and show that a similar story alcohol killed 779 people from alcohol advice mr. a 2012 577 from pharmaceutical lifeguards and canada deaths was zero in 2012 in Australia in terms of acute lethal toxin see how this work that sounds complicated but the figure on the left is the figure how many dice is required to achieve an effect and the figure on the right is how many of those doses will overdose and kill you heroin being the most dangerous someone to seek you look at how these works here's four beers - might get you drunk 40 beers might kill you and right down the bottom on coffee drinkers here stephanie's one to fifty Canada's one to Brighton in 20,000 and it turns out you have to eat something like a ton of the stuff so I always thought canvas was highly addictive and it turns out it's very low on the scale it's less far less addictive than a lot of other drugs heroin once again is the most highly addictive drug in this scale followed by it's close cousin methadone and alcohol and nicotine are quite addictive drugs they're both twice as a so I'll talk briefly about the endocannabinoid system how many people have actually heard of the endocannabinoid system what years could the growing number of people caring about so the endocannabinoid system is a homeostatic system that was discovered mid 90s why health professionals never heard about it it's a regulatory system a service system within our body that controls things like appetite mean system function and pain and it was discovered by an Israeli scientists and a few other scientists that the body produces natural cannabis like chemicals that are responsible for these things so cannabis mimics leave these chemicals and there's a number of receptors that chemists works on in the body cb1 which is mainly found in the brain and cb2 which is found throughout the body including the vital organs in the skin and it's important to note there's no cape canaveral receptors in the brain stem which controls breathing and respiration and cardiac function and that's why have such large amounts of cannabis and not potentially overdose on it which is important in palliative care patients where you might need to increase the dose as they're paying score gets higher and higher and higher terms of pharmacokinetics I want to point out is the between smoking cannabis which is in the red and the blue which is oral dose cannabis I believe it smoking cannabis to be a very poor delivery method of cannabis simply first you gave the wrong levels in your blood you get a massive amount almost initially which causes the patient to get high or psychotropic effects and different patients taking different amounts smoked into their lungs and in Australia only about 10% of people smoke so it's probably not a very popular delivery method most people will prefer to say something more pharmaceutically elegant like a capsule or a tablet as opposed to where you take it orally it might take about an hour to get to Stephen levels in your system when you get in good medical benefits at this low level over 24-hour period like a blood-pressure tablet or an antibody bubble is you're going to see a lot more pharmaceutically of elegant dose pitfalls like captions and tablets this is quickly cannabis inhaler coming out of Israel which connects to a smartphone and the doctor and patient can monitor their dosage pharmaceutically cannabis needs are growing they're going the same from crop to crop so chronically ill patients get the same medicine every single time and so I believe cannabis would be a bit of a pharmaceutical disruptive particularly in pain patients where it's got good medical benefits and it's competing with a lot of pharmaceutical drugs that have been researched for ages and goldstone the clinical trials canvas has been used underground for a long time and I think gonna see a lot more already farmers balances particularly with the up scheduling encoding so yeah thank you that's the kind of benefit raining in Israel there's none on the streets of Brisbane yet but in the future thank you for listening if we wouldn't look forward to asking your questions at the end and if you'd like to follow me on Facebook please add me on and medical cannabis research Australia or on a mobile thank you [Applause] [Music]"
fYRrZlvsih8,Father facing jail for treating his seriously ill daughters with cannabis juice,2018-03-13T03:28:52Z,[Music] pill after pill after pill it's just what I have to take on a daily basis Morgan Taylor and her sister Ariel locked into a life of daily medication so Crohn's disease is an autoimmune disease there's no cure there's just medications that subside the symptoms but a lot of the time they don't really work and they come with very very serious side effects Morgan was diagnosed with the debilitating bowel disease Crohn's when she was just 12 years old it's an illness that has sucked all the spontaneity out of her young life I kind of say that I'm not living anymore I'm just surviving that's what's really hard because it's not just you that it's acting it's affecting everybody around you you can't have a normal life you can't have a job and that's the hard thing because I had so many plans both Morgan and Arielle have Crohn's and it's put them into hospital repeatedly I got really bad arthritis from the Humira and my knees were swollen I couldn't walk some days I had a severe reaction to another drug my throat started closing up I was having an anaphylactic reaction my face was swelling up was getting rash that was very serious I was so sick I wasn't able to eat I was in constant pain yes they were saying so we didn't even think he'd make it yeah yeah they all have series again yeah the doctors were preparing them when I was going through the surgery the fact that I could die so it was pretty intense a couple of times there that I've carried Morgan into hospital weighing around 32 kilos actually carrying in my arms and crying no parents should have to do this at any stage watching his children suffer and traditional medicine failed them Stephen Taylor began to research medicinal cannabis and then and also work really well for the he says no doctor would take on the Therapeutic Goods Administration application process so Stephen took matters into his own hands and began preparing cannabis for his daughters we wanted to start using the leaves for juicing here Stephen is using spinach to demonstrate the process it claims the effects of the cannabis were dramatic within weeks that turn around actually Morgan I honestly believe when it a remission she was starting to put on weight she was starting to eat healthy food and we said fantastic this is fantastic it was really within a month and I was exercising a gained weight I got up to fifty kilos it's those kind of things you take for granted like I mean some people don't look forward to their daily run but it was something that was just like incredible for me but then reality hit the family's home was raided by police Stephen Taylor has been charged with cultivation of a hundred and seven plants and possession of cannabis he's now facing the very serious possibility of jail time we needed a lot of plant material for juicing the ideal juicing is 30 mils three times a day two bills you're talking about 180 mils 180 mils in the plant is a lot of plant material Ian McGregor is a professor of pharmacology at Sydney University and head of the lambert initiative for cannabinoid therapeutics is at the forefront of Australian research in two ways cannabis can be used for medicinal purposes in many ways juicing is a positive thing to do because you don't get nearly as much of the intoxicated component which is THC and you get a lot of another cannabinoid called THC a which has very strong anti-inflammatory properties in the gut professor McGregor says there is no definitive clinical study on the medical outcomes of juicing he estimates as many as a hundred thousand Australians are using cannabis for a variety of health problems so they're self-medicating of cannabis that we get from friends or bore themselves whereas the official system today and I think there's only service less than 500 patients so there's this massive discrepancy between what Australians are doing covertly and the over approved system which so far I would say is probably not delivering so many parents are screening out for it the government have to do something about this is this it's ridiculous you've got two young beautiful girls in their prime in their life spending half their life in hospitals and it doesn't have to that way medical cannabis has been legal in Australia since late 2016 but since then only 519 patients have got officially sanctioned approvals the GP should be allowed to prescribe medicinal cannabis in a timely way it's completely unacceptable for decision to be delayed for a month at times doctor Bastian Seidel is the man who represents GPS across the country he says the current system for medicinal cannabis is a basket case to have barriers in place to have unnecessary regulation that is basically consisting of piles and piles of paperwork and significant delays in the application process certainly does not meet the need of our patients doctors need to get approval from federal and state authorities to get access to medicinal cannabis the federal government says it is trying to streamline the approval process by eliminating the separate state red tape last week it announced New South Wales was the first state to come on board I've written to all of the states encouraging them to adopt a single system but the problems with access don't end there GPS and researchers say the TGA process often relies on medical specialists who may be opposed to medicinal cannabis use outright or don't agree on the scientific evidence behind prescribing it to patients well being quite distressed by some of the misinformation that's come from the College of Physicians and there was this article in the Medical Journal of Australia that claimed that there was no evidence for medicinal cannabis being better than placebo in treating pain and that's actually factually incorrect the colleges associate professor Adrian Reynolds has defended his articles claims there is evidence for some benefit for the cannabinoids in the treatment of multiple sclerosis related neuropathic pain and non MP MS in neuropathic pain the problem is the effects site is quite small there's enough evidence right now from studies that have been undertaken Internet ashle to show that the incidence of of adverse events is not small and some of those adverse events are potentially quite serious the College of Physicians is also trying to push back against public pressure to prescribe and even at a political level there are pressures expectations being placed on doctors when doctors don't really have the information available to make these decisions and the leading bodies medical bodies around the country in the large are saying it's premature we need to stop we need to pause take a deep breath and reconsider where we're at at the moment for now the Taylor sisters continue to wait for help while their dad faces called options it's pretty scary to think about long term and how I'm going to manage my disease I think it's just wrong the way the government has set this up that we cannot access this amazing plan

wVlIZkbdwF4,The Potential Benefits of Medical Marijuana | Dr. Alan Shackelford | TEDxCincinnati,2018-07-23T17:11:56Z,"[Applause] the morning of February 12th 2012 started off pretty normally in my busy medical office in Denver with phones ringing patient consultations pretty much business as usual and I was with a patient when my office manager Joyce knocked on my door that was unusual Joyce never knocked on my door when I was with a patient there's a call for you she said you handle it I said little irritated no this is a call you need to take she said that call would change my life and the lives of my patients from then on the woman on the phone was named Paige and she sounded desperate dr. Shackleford she said would you please see my five-year-old daughter Charlotte and my first thought was no I don't work with children and then Paige told me that Charlotte had been having seizures since she was six months old and she had been diagnosed with a rare genetic condition called dravet syndrome none of the medicines that had been prescribed for Charlotte had worked not one of 17 different prescription drugs and now they wanted to try a horse tranquilizer from Europe and then Paige said something that really stunned to me she said she had been reading that medical marijuana might be able to stop seizures and she said dr. Shackleford will you please recommend some so that we can try it for Charlotte and I was dumbfounded I how could I possibly rationalize recommending that a child use marijuana for any purpose and I was concerned that if I did it it might endanger my medical license but then Paige told me that Charlotte had had two cardiac arrests too at the age of five and it made me think of my daughter Vanessa who was swimming in the ocean and ice skating and eagerly looking forward to starting school when she was Charlotte's age and Charlotte had never experienced any of those things and she might never experience them because 73 percent of children with dravet syndrome who have uncontrolled seizures died before their 10th birthday and when I finished medical school I pledged to use all of my skills and all of my training to sustain life to care for the patient's I was privileged to take care of to the best of my ability to use all that training to cure when possible but to comfort always and so I knew that I had to see Charlotte and I wouldn't necessarily promise to recommend that she used marijuana but I would see her and a few days later Paige and Charlotte came to my office and in the two hours that Charlotte was there she had five seizures one in the parking lot two in the waiting room and two while I was examining her now imagine your child having seizures like this again 300 a week 3 an hour every hour of every day for five years now I had heard pretty much the same thing that Paige had that there was a compound in the marijuana plant called CBD or cannabidiol that might be able to control seizures there was one study on it published in 1980 and I just happened to have read that so CBD is remarkable unlike THC it doesn't get you high and I did not want for Charlotte to get high I also didn't want for her to smoke marijuana in fact I don't want anybody to smoke marijuana because oral dosing is much more effective and so I filled out the necessary paperwork so that Paige could go down to the dispensary and buy all of the high CBD low THC cannabis in Enver an ounce and a half for $800 and Paige gave it to an herbalist friend of hers in Colorado Springs who extracted it into an oil and then Paige very nervously put several drops of it in Charlotte's mouth and I was on pins and needles after this waiting to hear what had happened had it had it worked or had it been a dismal failure had the whole thing maybe been a huge mistake it was like waiting for the astronauts to land on the moon if you remember that and then finally when Paige did call me she said dr. Shackleford Charlotte has not had one single seizure for an entire week not one it's like a miracle and Paige was right it was a miracle for Charlotte but I had known long before I met Charlotte that medical cannabis could work wonders I knew it actually three years before because a patient of mine named Joan in an occupational medicine practice where I was working at the time had asked me to make it possible for her to use marijuana for pain and and I Joan was a remarkable patient but she had been injured in a work accident and was taking more than a hundred percocet tablets a month and the pain was still so bad that she couldn't do normal household chores even cook for her family and she was severely constipated and was worried about being addicted but she had read that marijuana might be helpful for chronic pain and she begged me to make it possible for her to do so so very reluctantly I filled out that paperwork so Joan Cattrall and Joan went out and got the medical cannabis now I say reluctantly because I know nothing about it I didn't know anything really about how to recommend cannabis and there was no medical research on it I couldn't find any articles on it in any of the medical journals that I was reading you see on that classically-trained very conservative physician I graduated from the University of Heidelberg School of Medicine where I did research as a medical student and then I did seven years of post-grad training at the Harvard Medical School where I was also a research fellow I don't usually recommend treatments that I don't understand and I want to know exactly how the drugs work but I didn't have access to any of that scientific data that I normally relied on when it came to medical marijuana what I did have was a desperate patient whose pain medicines weren't working very well and to my surprise and I have to say to my great relief it worked extremely well for Joan Joan was able to reduce the number of percocet she was taking from a hundred a month to fifty than the 20 and then she could stop taking it altogether it was really pretty remarkable now today just six years after I first met Charlotte there are lots more articles in the scientific literature on the medical uses of cannabis and on the more than a hundred different compounds found in the marijuana plant that are remarkable for their medical applicability let me give you an example researchers in California have found that cannabis is a particularly good treatment for pain and it is in fact the THC that is so powerful researchers in Israel learned that nearly half of the patients with Crohn's disease who use medical cannabis no longer have any symptoms of the disease at all and there are tantalizing early indications from from research on the plant that some of the compounds found in the marijuana plant may someday be used to treat cancer now a lot more research is necessary and marijuana is not a panacea or a cure-all but the medical community is now beginning to recognize that cannabis may play an important role in taking care of patients for whom conventional therapies aren't working very well and that is something that most of the 20,000 patients I've seen over the last nine years can attest to I had really no idea where that phone call would lead me six years ago when Paige called but I can say from a great deal of experience that miracles are pretty commonplace among patients for whom nothing else has worked nothing but medical cannabis this is not about pot this is about patients now you may be wondering about Charlotte and what happened this is Charlotte about a year after she first started using medical cannabis what Charlotte is saying here is ballerina ballerina you can see her dancing [Applause] and she's still doing very very well now next time you or someone you love is suffering from pain that's not responding to conventional treatments or has another medical tradition that might benefit from the use of cannabis think about medical cannabis think about the thousands of patients who have benefited from it and think about Charlotte at ballerina it changed her life and it just might change yours thank you you"

PszIfHRrmTw,UIC Australian Medicinal Cannabis Symposium 2017,2018-02-11T21:34:24Z,good morning and welcome to the medicinal cannabis symposium unfortunately Luci my wife is suffering from a huge migraine it's absolutely smashed her and she's gone gone to bed which is a shame because she knows absolutely everything that's going on here because she put it together so anyway hopefully she'll get better in the next hour or two and my kevie like everything when somebody starts something like this and runs it from the word go pretty much on her own she's indispensable when it comes to opening up the the Dacian thing okay so please bear with me she's I've got I've got her opening address here we didn't only take a couple of minutes and I'll just read that we that aired if I might so firstly to our to our VIPs who we all we will meet in a moment to our international and Australian speakers to the health professionals and last but not least the attending patients and their carers that are here today and thank you for coming and I'm sure that to you won't you might be disappointed with the program I'll just take a couple of moments to reflect on what has prompted United in compassion to put on an event such as this the fact is this it shouldn't be so hard to show compassion for people who are suffering but the politics of self-interest some historical some recently invented it's gotten in the way and enduring war on drugs that put cannabis in the same class as heroin despite it being remarkably safe and non-toxic the the reefer madness here that inflicted racism and hysteria to on the general public from the top down on from which it is still alive and well in Australia in Australian political circles the blanket prohibition which has meant the scientific research into therapeutic use of cannabis was stifled but we searched into harm harms way was encouraged and exaggerated the the outdated UN Single Convention which deemed cannabis to have no therapeutic value in 1961 decades to the prior to the discovery of the endocannabinoid in dope can animal with cannabis offer I say I know the word I know it the endo cannabinoid system I'm not gonna say that now am i from the rest of this for the rest of the the meeting anyway nevertheless politicians and bureaucrats will use as an excuse for inaction at every time the recreational cannabis movement which allows médicos and government to postulate that medical cannabis patients are sure to be recreational users in disguise which is so untrue cannabis use is not about getting well but about getting high this is what they're saying the influence of the big pharmaceutical companies and the rise of the opiates as the medicos drug of choice the filing of the medical possession a profession to see that through the rhetoric and keep up with the science coupled with the choice of some health professionals to dismiss all things cannabis this commonplace attitude was summed up accurately by TB Strauss into 2016 cannabinoid in medical practice when he said I have come to see the willful ignorance about cannabinoids as a form of patient abandonment the message to the patient seems to be figure it out yourself not to tell me about it such a stance is not consistent with the highest values and aspirations of medicine and so the list goes on so here we are in Australia today years after the politicians started to acknowledge that there was a need to address the human of suffering patients and make cannabis available to them today we see the government appointed Advisory Council stacked with many anti cannabis appointees who have strong affiliations with the pharmaceutical industry today we see smoke and mirrors a mirage of share a sham of a policy which is not which has so largely been influenced by all the above and which keeps patients patient access to legal forms of cannabis as far or if not further away than ever so let's pull back to why we are here in 2014 the cannabis coke my dying son quality of life it stopped his previously uncontrolled nausea and vomiting in its tracks it gave him an appetite it helped him sleep it helped his pain and allowed him to rely less on the opiates that caused so many horrendous side-effects and gave him and gave him hope in the life in the last in the four years that when he was dying the last year would you believe was our best year with him the best year with him on the last year of his life was because we put him on the cannabis and it it made him it made him live well for the others it is the chance to stop Brian damaging seizures painful spasms control post-traumatic stress manage chronic and neuropathic pain disorders and the list just goes on federal government has said it recognized and reacted to this suffering he took the political accolades for responding with compassion so now it must take the criticism for the ineffective policy the lip service the protection of Industry and the portrayal of patients the the voice of the majority has been stolen because the public policy inflicted on us is already broken so let's put the focus back on the patient's back on the science and back on the reason we need to do better with cannabis reform it is called compassion and if a clever and innovative country such as Australia can't be motivated by looking after the sick instead of treating them as criminals and keeping them in the grip of the black market then we have a very big problem and that might need to be become an election an election issue in 2019 so without further ado thank you for coming thank you for your interest and let's all work together for Public Policy that reflects the dignified alleviation of suffering with compassion and empathy and it's such a shame she's not here Lucy that is I would now like to introduce the host for the day and I'll just tell you a bit about John John to me is a health educator a professional speaker and Trina has worked extensively as a health and

everybody first I'd like to thank you for overcoming whatever challenges that you needed to overcome to get here some of you have come from far away some of you probably travelled across three suburbs but whatever it took welcome for those of you who are not from Melbourne welcome to the world's most livable city where the coffee's great the football is even greater and the weather is extraordinary until people these days that if you really want to experience traditional Melbourne weather you have to go to Sydney today would come together to learn to gather information to share ideas to support each other and become the best agents of change that we can possibly become societies sometimes get locked down in ethics that no longer suit the current society and it takes courage and it takes perseverance to push through the fixed ideas and the rigid viewpoints that seek to prevent change so invite you all as we sit here today and we hear from some wonderful speakers who have got some incredible things to share with us to not just open your minds but please open your hearts because the people that we seek to educate they're not bad people they're just stuck in some viewpoints that need to be explored so to open we have a video from the Honorable Jill Hennessy Victorian Health Minister unfortunately she couldn't be here today we have a few politicians who couldn't be here today and I'm sure it's not because brahmam bishops using the helicopter so yes so Jill Hennessy has a piece for us she's coming in via video she can't be here because Victorian Parliament's being called for an extra day and she has to be there that's her public role so please give your attention to the screen now thank you and good morning everyone I want to thank United in compassion for the opportunity to officially open the UIC Australian medical cannabis symposium here in Melbourne like United in compassion the Victorian Government has been at the forefront of driving the change in attitudes as well as access to medicinal cannabis in Australia the Andrews government is committed to providing access to medicinal cannabis to those in need in 2016 we introduced the first access to medicinal cannabis legislation in Australia and I'm delighted that the Commonwealth Government has also opened up access pathways at the Commonwealth level and reduce the import restrictions making imported medicinal cannabis more available to more Australians Victoria continues to remain at the forefront of the push to provide medicinal cannabis to patients in need in Australia and earlier this month you may have seen media footage of the first medicinal cannabis crop being grown right here in Victoria we are the only state in Australia that is undertaking the very groundbreaking work to formulate and manufacture medicinal cannabis products for children with intractable epilepsy Victoria holds the only manufacturing permit issued to date which means that we'll be the first to produce a locally grown legal safe high quality product with consistent dosing and known composition being the first mover means that Victorian patients will benefit sooner but it also means we've had to find the practical and regulatory pathways through every issue against a backdrop of fast-developing regulation science and clinical practice and it's challenging as this has been the good news is that we're learning a great deal that will benefit everyone here as the medicinal cannabis industry matures in coming months in the while we develop our Victorian product I know that for many patients access can't come soon enough and for some very ill children everyday without access to these products is a day too long that's why in March this year our government fast-tracked access to imported product for 29 very ill Victorian children who simply couldn't wait for the development of a Victorian product and we're determined to ensure our product is of the highest quality and safety we're in the process of rigorous formulation testing and quality control to ensure that the product that we provide for Victorian children is safe and of a reliable quality and known composition a product that doctors can prescribe to their patients with confidence and a product that parents can provide to their children with confidence knowing the exact composition and the correct dosage for their child looking at the agenda over the next three days it's really encouraging to see a strong focus on the evidence base from around the world the Victorian government established an independent medical advisory committee to ensure that we are constantly reviewing new research and evidence as it emerges and receiving expert advice on expanding patient access based on the evidence over time events like this one are a fantastic opportunity for the public patient advocacy groups clinicians and researchers from around Australia and the world to share vital knowledge and experience so I want to thank you all so very much for your time this morning I hope you enjoy your stay in our beautiful city and that you leave this important symposium feeling optimistic and inspired about the future when it comes to medicinal cannabis because I believe it's a very bright one you
HUEO1xSqwoE,Australia: The Truth About Medical Cannabis | The Ugly Truth - Ep. 27,2018-01-30T10:10:57Z,"[Music] you're listening to the ugly truth podcast with George and Christina makowsky your weekly injection of science insights and myth-busting for awesome info and trending content go to the ugly truth log hello everybody and welcome back to the ugly truth welcome us we're here in 2018 now and we've got Ben Fitzsimmons so we're here today to talk about what have your favorite subject so I got my green shirt on to visual representation of that yep and Ben Fitzsimmons is going to tell us a little bit about himself and how he is working with marijuana yeah thanks guys I mean um I guess my stories of a property guy my background and got to a point in my life where the property had set itself up so provide me to buy back my time so I didn't have to work on a full-time job didn't have to go and do more things than what I already had them on my plate which gave me time to think about things and look at what's happening around the world and one of the things that sort of struck me that was happening starting to happen overseas particularly in the US was medicinal cannabis and started reading some of the stories about Colorado where it really took a foothold and how that changed their economy there and changed their the way the government works the way the government's funded and I thought well we've got you know similar sort of issues here in South Australia facing us with with holdings closure and and a raft of other industries that have that have moved on from here and we've got unemployment issues we've got your government that's spending money that needs revenue to cover off costs we've also got a situation here in South Australia where it's fairly you know well-known that there is a marketplace for cannabis already in South Australia and huge like that yeah and I think you know a lot of people on that side of the coin refer to Adelaide as Amsterdam at the southern hemisphere it's just not not illegal most what's been decriminalized exactly yeah yeah it's empty nobody at one stage you could grow quite a few parts for personal use yes no I'm determined yeah up to ten Williams quite liberal so Australia South Australia has been the supplier of most of Australia in the black market trade yeah it comes to cannabis yeah a lot of people want the skills here absolutely absolutely absolutely and it's it's um it's a fascinating rabbit hole to dive into and get an understanding of how that world works and what what it takes to be in that industry also temper that with the attitude from government and police about what they try and do about the industry as well so it's a very fascinating conversation to have because it's it's a lot of people have been touched by somewhere in the line it's you know it's it's I haven't personally tried it but you know obviously you know around people who have and it's it's very common in South Australia totally totally however arm week I mean in Australia what we're doing is we've got open farms and Opium's quite a small market marijuana world stuff it is except Australia suppliers 50% of the opium to the opiate manufacturers in the world so well they've gone on a world scale Australia is a massive player which is something that he's actually at loggerheads against cannabis yeah and we're seeing that more and more in the u.s. now with in particularly in Australia now we've Australia was the last last year was the first time that there had been more pharmaceutical related in Australia and illicit substances oh really so the the there is a huge problem in the u.s. with what they call the opioid addiction where people are literally addicted to painkillers and and you know can can you can you know take their own life but there's a massive problem I've heard about it recently it's a huge people because the problem is it's a physical addiction as well it's not just mental yes so getting off those sort of pharmaceuticals is very difficult very very dangerous - well it's a destructive drug to your body you know whereas cannabis isn't which is a very interesting revelation I hadn't you say okay maybe we haven't actually been told the truth about because what's the story behind it and you dig a little deeper and it becomes real amazing amazing tale so why do you think it is that cannabis has been vilified in the media and why is it seen as such a negative thing okay you go back to the USA you you've got to talk world politics with this because you go back to 1937 a man in the USA called Harry Anslinger and mr. Anslinger his former role was to keep alcohol prohibited more crime that he feels exactly right and and so you put yourself in the shoes of him and he's got a foot soldiers out on the front line he's got a job to do he needs his role protected and he stumbles across cannabis which some of the quotes that you can read attributed to him online about what his statements were in the 30s about cannabis are just horrific racist based [Applause] commentary he described how he tried cannabis once and turned into a bat and that's why it's dangerous you think this is this is a real interesting character and so from from the decision to to basically criminalize what was a freely and and freely prescribed by medical professionals up to that point no one treatments you can go back through time it's been you know used by Chinese medicine all the way through history cannabis has been used as a medicine and then come comes you know this man in the USA and all of a sudden that global perception all it starts to shift and starts to change true through the USA's dominance of of the world in politic really well so a system that something that happened in USA affected everyone else in the whole world yeah yeah so they started taking control of it they also took control of hemp because you've got imagine you're a owner of the largest newspapers around in the USA you also own forestry that needs to make the paper to sell your papers and it's a very easy story than to get rid of hemp which is a huge and way more beneficial to the environment a lot easier to grow a lot easy to grow the yield that a hemp for paper is far more impressive than what forestry is yet self-interest in that regard yeah yeah there's a there someone who's got a very loud voice because they can keep printing front pages and until this till their version of the truth yeah up to hundreds of thousands of people and all the sudden that becomes the truth yeah decided that I flipped we've had been cotton as well it wasn't it absolutely none was it so you go back to the DuPont family or say it's all very it's very easy to be tinfoil hat wearing type of things you go back and you know that's that's all all the all the informations they're freely available to read if you go looking for it yeah yeah so it's quite a fascinating way that this plant and it's it is a plant and has turned into a maligned and misunderstood well I went through school being told marijuana cannabis as a gateway drug if you do they began another part and so many people still say yes yeah yeah well and the reason for that is the gateway part of that is because you've got to go to the you know the shadows on a Friday night to get your little bag of cannabis buyers probably standing there with some harder stuff as well that says hey look why don't you try this for 50 bucks so it being a legal sort of gave it that connotation with it well it's easy it's easy to lump into that that that topic it's easy to it's it's treated as hard as heroin or cocaine or that's the law of the way the law works in Australia and most countries internationally up until recently is it's treated exactly the same and and we know that you know people heroin kills people cocaine kills people it was pop killing exactly go read a little bit of cannabis and the difference with that it doesn't shut off that part of your brain that looks after your Airways and your respiration yep so you can you can overdose on it because it would just you would just go unconscious where whether you go on other things like opiates and alcohol yeah and go on conscious it's a lot more dangerous it was shot you sure you don't shut your body down where's so what cannabis place to is there's a part of our body which is only a recent discovery - a recent 1990s bio Israeli professor Raphael much along who discovered we have what seems the inside us is known as the endocannabinoid system mm-hmm cannabinoid cannabis yep very similar for a reason if you were breastfed you've had cannabinoids put into your body so whether you've touched cannabis or not you actually have it so when when you see a baby a slip from breast milk when you see someone who's stoned in adverted comments yeah the expression is very very similar on their face there's a reason for that it's the way that it impacts on our body and are you talking about catabolism THC so so just jumping around a little bit but no no it's all good that's all amazing information so so so cannabis can be made up of cannabinoids CBD cannabinoids or THC and THC is the component of cannabis that gives the euphoria effect effect so it is possible to have cannabis that has zero THC in it it's also possible as cannabis that it's got a huge amount of THC in it depends on the strain depends on how it's grown depends on the cultivation depends on a lot of things so I often what I'm explaining the differences in cannabis I explain it to people like the wine industry because a lot of us are familiar with one you've got red wine and white one okay they look different they taste different some gets you drunkard fast some people champagne is very different to having a Pinot right and then inside those you've got P know you've got sure as you know you've got all the variants different so if you think of it in that light it's not just grow grow a cannabis plant and that's what it is there's a massive mixture of what the plants are antennas has more more expertise and covered in this area more and more strains are being grown and trialed and and so on it's it's a very fascinating industry and a lot of information recently come out about CBD how a lot of health effects like ant information and things like that yeah yeah so World Health Organization December 2017 came out and this is where it gets very topical and so in Australia not just South Australia so the World Health Organization came out and said CBD has has proven benefits of helping people in pain and also also helping people with epileptic seizures so the world organization said that's demonstrated bonafide proven we accept that they also went on to say that CBD is not addictive because that's another surfy if you like of cannabis and you're addicted to it no you're not it's not addictive it's not like tobacco it's not like alcohol there's no addiction yes you can use it a lot but to actually have an addiction where you have to have your body has to have it it doesn't work that way and I think I know a few people that work with mental well better to make it could also just think they put a bitch'll thing rather than an addiction and it's a different difference yes it's different you know you often see that with people who give up tobacco they put on weight because they need something their hands and they turn to food yes right so it's it's not an addiction to tobacco anymore it's the habit of putting hand to mouth yeah very very different thing so World Health Organization has come and said CVD is is they effectively said it shouldn't be classed as a drug we're also saying water which is the Olympic drug testing body that holds says what's legal what's not they've removed CBD from the banned substances oh really so so now you can be an Olympian you can be an American Olympian and use CBD for pain treatment well Australian Olympian become very very different yeah and this is where we start getting into the politics of it because the day the World Health Organization released the documents and said this is proven the Australian Government released documents saying that there's no proof that it does we'll all right you think hmm okay how can which which body am i believing here the one that's in charge of health globally or the one that's in charge of 21 million Australians that's interesting no cuz I've when thoughts won all those medals and after they got busted um smoking cannabis yeah and they were looking at revoked India's medal because you know the THC about anyone who's tried marijuana knows it's not gonna really inherit that's right and if they got food munchies that you're running after you know that's a great example because isn't that the antithesis of what we've been taught mmm dire that broke all these World Records when all these gold medals was an elite athlete like we haven't seen before this people and he uses or has used cannabis yeah it doesn't that fly again yeah story go on we all grew up with use cannabis you gonna sit on the couch do the twisties and watch TV order exactly didn't happen to him in exactly interesting very interesting yes and and it's happening all you know we've seen particular in the US and the US is gonna be a leader in this space where NFL players are coming out saying we want to use cannabis for medical reasons to help with pain relief versus yeah you jabbing us in the knee or the whatever it is that's wrong with us with an opiate based painkiller because that is proven to have degenerative effects to their body NBA players are starting to talk about it now you've got a coach of the Golden State Warriors Steve Kerr's come out and said that he's use medical cannabis for his back pain so more and more of these stories are starting to come out because now that it's somewhat legalized in the u.s. it's not federally legal which is a whole different discussion but guys over in California they can openly say I use this because it's it's legal in their state to use it and so now sudden you've got global superstars talking about how they use cannabis and the stories change the ambassadors for it very much well that they're starting up their own businesses instead they're buying into licensed premises or growing for growing their own products well a lot of people looking at investing into Medical Marijuana because you're gonna be so big because at the moment you're Colorado and they made a lot of money you know cannabis in the first year whatever some tax wise as millions and billions of dollars yes huge but they've they've approved it for recreational use as well California is gone recreational legal for January one mission really well rather I think and this is say think because the landscape in the u.s. changes daily there's more states where it's legal than not us some of those are medical only and some of those are recreational in okay so so the so the stance that the government's take over there well that the local governments take is that well if you want to use this recreation we fine but if you want to use it medically that's also fine we're not going to stand in your way of doing that if whatever reason you want to use this don't go to doctor and so I've got back pain can you yeah don't clog the medical system yeah if it's just something that you want to go on trial have fun there's a recreational sense so the the fuel the state's actually said we're just gonna go straight to recreation make it easier make just otherwise you've clogged up the system you never has to wait in line to get through yeah and they're gonna do it anyway you're gaming the system um yes really who and and the system's they really want well what the fact of it is let's face it this on what's been a while they can get easily anywhere absolutely so absolutely my point that is though having to go to the black market to get it you don't know how much THC or CBD is in it you don't know what they've played on it to make it more powerful or whatever who knows actually true dangerous unregulated you don't exactly know what you're getting so you're trusting that you're actually getting what the people are selling it to you were saying it is but how do you know yeah do you trust your drug dealer or not yeah good question now think anyone's familiar why that's why it's gonna help if it is that's right anyway and go back to what I said before about all the different strains of cannabis because we know that out of the the studies that have been done in particularly Israel absolutely the years ahead of the rest of the world there they have identified different strains so they could say here's medical cannabis a we know that it will help you with XY is it try that and that patient has no reaction to it doesn't solve any other problems okay let's go and try B works Oh okay what what's the difference between a and B and now so now they're drilling down genetic makeup there you are because what what the the current thinking is and where it looks like it's mostly headed is what's called n1 trials so n1 trials is one type of medicine for one person versus a factory printing out tablet after tablet off the tablet of the same stuff saying look this all works for instance if you give my mother panadeine she'll end up in hospital if I take it I'm completely fine yeah so why does that happen the same thing happens with cannabis so sometimes it works some of that strain will work for some people it won't work for others yep so it's very much a trial and error type of product and that's what's really happening in the u.s. at the moment look I tried that last month I don't you know I feel better but I don't know if it was the foot I'll try this this work because a different proportion of CBD one CVT to or that's right yes your honor that's right combination yes and that's where we don't know yet what the different there's a hundred and there's over 160 different cannabinoids have been identified Wi-Fi and we don't know what they do yet so the Israeli government attitude is look we don't know why it's working keep taking it because you're clearly getting some benefit from many yeah whether it's pain relief or you're not having seizures anymore or whatever the case may be so we'll just try and work out why it works but you're taking care of whereas in Australia we seem to have a different attitude we don't know what it does we don't know why it does it so therefore we're not going to let anyone have it yeah but it's been approved medical in Estonia yeah so these well this is this is really getting to that yeah this is where we get a bit challenged and how hard is it to exactly get prescribed medical marijuana there's a lot to unpack and very to very easy questions so my attitude into Australia is that medical cannabis hasn't been legalized so we see the headlines medical cannabis is legalized yeah we read in the papers we have the politicians coming out saying oh it's so great we've solved all the problems the reality is what's being legalized in Australia is a pharmaceutical product that has cannabis as an ingredient versus what happens in the rest of the world you walk into a licensed dispensaries it's a product that's been grown in controlled circumstances so people know that it's there's no pesticides etc etc and they will sell you a flower and oil and edible or whatever and you can literally take the wall plant raw plant material home and vaporize it smoke it whatever you want to do versus in Australia we the system is that you can be licensed to cultivate license to manufacture or license to do research and you need to have two of those three boxes ticked so one being cultivation because obviously I've got a growth and when you pick the flower in Australia you have immediately starting to become manufacturer so you now need to do something with that flower so in the US they would take that flower put it in a sealed container put on the shelf and southern that's to me it's medical cannabis versus here we need to now take that to GMP approved facility and actually construct a tablet we can't actually sell yeah yeah so therein lies the difference in Australia no sorry is that so they can monetize it more by putting fillers only going through the pharmaceutical system and then that way they don't miss out on all that extra money yeah that's a great question follow the money you follow the money and the the the challenge is is that these there's a number of pharmaceutical companies that have been established listed on the stock exchange some of them worth hundreds of millions of dollars in market cap now creating we're creating a sub brand of the pharmaceutical industry versus creating a medical cannabis industry and the reason why that exists in my opinion is there's a the government body in Australia is called the TGA Therapeutic Goods Administration they decide what we're allowed to put in our body and what we're not allowed to put now yeah and they decide what's good and what's bad as far as the scale of drugs so so when it comes to cannabis it got taken from a schedule nine product and made a schedule eight so I've taken away from being in that codec alongside heroin and cocaine which by the way you can still go to your doctor and get a script for amazing really okay yeah because they do have mint they started life in the medical yep so they've been taken of schedule nine to put in the schedule eight so they've put in the hardest possible category of drug if it's got TOC you know if it doesn't have THC in it it becomes schedule for which is a little more than something you'd go to the pharmacy and buy over-the-counter so the perception is is that should be easier to access the schedule for drug however many many many GPS and specialists are finding it very challenging in Australia to go through the process and get approval to allow their patients to have it to the point where a lot of them that confide in me are saying patients and GPS and specialists are saying it's just too hard we're just I'm people to go find it themselves which in Australia there are people that are non who can help you yes but the thing is if you want th it's easy we're getting see if it is a lot harder isn't not will that can they can you know that can be processed for you yeah so you can and these healers they call themselves healers and they can say what do you seems okay this is what you need and there are an amazing collection of brains out there that will tell you what strain you need what you talked about the different yeah these people highly invasive they're highly highly educated you go back to the specialist skills of there's people that are you know savants almost in this as a product because they're so specialized and it's fascinating to me really really fascinating where'd you find these guys oh can you follow them online yeah yeah yeah yeah there's Facebook groups and there's us it's quite open when you're when you're when you boil your water Google for a lot you know I don't want to be able to do there on things that are illegal so um do not Google this yeah yeah those those people out there and we've got in South Australia Jenny Hallam there's a well publicized case at the moment who's going through the court system and being prosecuted as a as a drug dealer all that so it's really challenging and we're in a very very you know tipping point almost of which way this is going to go so well see it is some it's gonna be legal in America sooner or later Australia's gonna join but it's gonna take us longer no no this is this is I'll tell you what's gonna happen to be like gay marriage Nottoli yeah yeah it's very soon it's really we're discussing you're wondering about and then we did it anywhere we all knew is gonna happen that's right that's right Australia wanted to hold back a little bit time and we're very conservative Australia yeah we have become tight reason too long to think of new ideas that actually get implemented and then you look at what's happening New Zealand New Zealand just following us out of the water as far as very progressive very progressive versus what you know that's what I hope out of my leadership you know for my country is that we are progressive we are inclusive we are open to new things and we're not closed off and trying to you know pretend it's still 1960 you and why privilege and all that sort of you know like that that personally bothers me that we're not being advantage adventurous enough to try new things so are we missing of economic benefit too because we're so conservative yeah I mean you got camp is about to legalize marijuana and they're gonna be manufacturing apparently all right yeah it's bigger than alcohol ya know when at one of the alcohol companies is well one of one of the alcohol companies put a 200 million dollar investment into a cannabis company a couple months ago Wow so that's telling yeah Philip Morris or a massive player in the cannabis industry yes that would be because that goes bad look we know the gross stuff we know how to put it into packages yeah we're gonna have to sell it to people with this whole network that already exists they're very interested yes that would be a big fulfil Morris huge your original plans mmm we're set to employ around a thousand people yup in South Australia can you tell us a little bit about your business venture idea and what you've submitted to the government and what's been you know what's happened with that whole thing okay so the original idea in South Australia we've got the the Holden planet Elizabeth which is a low socio-economic area it's a massive facility about a hundred thousand square meters under roof there was obviously well publicized that was coming to an end and the question was asked what do we do with it and go back to what I touched on beforehand we've got this whole industry in South Australia we know there's a we estimate not know we estimate there's about a ton a week leave South Australia and $10 a gram hmm you're talking about a million dollars a week mm-hmm well in production in the black market and that's what the police police force looking to try and stop it yep so you know imagine what it could be if it was freed up huge the thing with cannabis is is that it's a hugely labor-intensive business because it's the way it has to be trimmed and picked and the plants nurtured etc etc so give you an idea Denver the population of Denver when it's cutting season in Denver Colorado 10,000 people increase it's like picking season in the in Mildura well backpackers lobbying pick the fruit yeah they get paid and they leave they're all good stone so you know that that's the sort of scale that you're talking about well and and you know the numbers we talked about they're all absolutely realistic on and so if you were to turn holds to a cannabis plant plants which have been employing the same that appear with it Holland's worse or more or less now be a couple of thousand yeah yeah so what a few people yeah somebody was holding that touch over three and their pet was and where would this cannabis Cove medical medical yeah be national national pet so if we're talking about the way I see medical cannabis it's going to be national I'll go back to what I was saying before I can tell you what's going to happen internationally my belief is goes back to that World Health Organization document that was a very critical state that's a huge step forward isn't it absolutely because what what the United the reason why the drug rules exist internationally as they do in law is the United Nations singular convention from 1967 so that's when they said right cocaine no heroin no cannabis like all the narcotics that we know of and internationally so they can't be traded etc etc what the United Nations has had as a legal opinion in last year is that it's an infringement of someone's human rights to deny them access to medicine oh wow so if they say something is okay for medicine yeah as a country you can't even stop it can you because they'll become illegal so so you're not relations so that what the you know you team that with the World Health Organization statement about we don't actually think CBD is even a drug and that it does have proven medical benefits so you go to the next step okay so the United Nations at some point this year will actually my belief is take cannabis off of the restricted list now all of a sudden is no longer federally illegal in the USA now every other country on the planet is kind of want to sell into the u.s. yes okay so that's gonna be the largest domino to fall yeah cuz everyone's gonna be ready to sell a lot place on Mexico they reduce a lot of them well then it's already legal yeah yeah it's not even quite nice isn't to America yes yeah yeah yeah yeah that's right absolutely glosses it's it's already legalized there and it's already you know we've all seen that you know the horrific footage of the drug cartel deaths in Mexico all that's ceasing because in any business you strangle it's cashflow yeah yeah that's it legalize legalize drugs and family it's a criminal element because they're not getting that extra margin because that's what the criminal works so well yeah it's something you frame for risk they're getting a massive margin yep and you cut that out suddenly there's no profit that's just they can't compete yeah because they're used to big margins that's what I can't compete with a modern company well I also literally take cash out of the hand yeah you don't turn it so you know and cash that's used to go to other things we've doesn't exist anymore they all of a sudden all their money's traceable all that all their transactions are traceable it's really interesting by the dynamics of Richard Branson's one of the great proponents of against the war on drugs it's not working that's right you look at a country like Portugal which is actually decriminalized all drugs what we're not nothing actually drug addicts does less Bhagat except for these little s drug use because it's not treated as a criminal problem its treated as a health problem which is what it is exactly you know it because someone's for whatever circumstances in life puts a needle in their arm with heroin in it yeah we deem them to be a criminal but they've created and something they're addicted to and they're not gonna get better by putting them in jail or getting them arrested that's not gonna help someone so the the current flavour I hope is leaning towards more empathy and assistance for people like that like we've got with mental health you know mental health was never discussed before now it's a that's a free and open topic mm-hmm I can see us as a society going down that path and quite quickly yeah that's awesome um but you're right the war on drugs didn't work No at all nor terror more terrorism and there were drugs that more drugs yeah yes yeah there's a fascinating documentary and I wish I could find it was one of those late night on TV things and they actually proved that doing drug busts in I'm sure was like it was in the US and was in Portland I think it was and they actually graphed that when they did a major methamphetamine bust they could actually chart the crime increases and the hospitalization increases because what would happen was the stuff that they didn't get was the only only only product that was left on the marketplace so all of a sudden there was a void in the marketplace the stuff that was left got cut up harder and harder with bad oh right to fill the demand yeah and that's the stuff that put people in hospital where is the pure the more pure the product doesn't have that great physiological effect on people yeah so you start putting bad product in the marketplace to fill the demand hospitalization when a crime goes up arrests go up it's a much it's really fascinating to me and it's something I never thought I'd be talking to people about but you know it it really fascinates me how how we do this to each other yes suggesting if things aren't as simple as what people think it is and just by is so everything's got a effect and try the stop something doesn't miss for the stop it sometimes it makes it worse or much bigger yeah and you're dealing with very savvy people who if you put a roadblock up okay now we'll just sit down and look at especially there's all that profit you're gonna there's a lot of reasons that a lot of savvy people yeah well people risking going to jail to sell a plant you know so you're crazy my prepared to take risks they're prepared that you know and it's why are we doing that why are we creating one the incentive like you talked about your disincentivize people straight away so it's not you know and that place to you know the fear in the u.s. where are you know if we make it more accessible more kids are going to use it and well actually what's happened is the opposite because it's no longer edgy dangerous it's got cool it's mainstream oh yeah so kids actually are you smoking less cannabis where it's been legalized oh really yeah because all of a sudden you've taken that edgy danger you're not you're not you know you know you know you're not the guy that will the girl that goes and does that stuff because no one doesn't nobody cares is not the student anymore so what so bengi explain the difference between recreational cannabis and medical cannabis yeah this is a great question and I've got choices on how I can answer okay the reality is the reality is it's our attitude towards right okay so I can I can grow a plant in a approved facility and grow the exact same strain next to it it's kind of look exactly the same put it in brown paper bags and you will not know the difference the reason is because it's a plant there's nothing magical about one or the other there's nothing bad about one or the other it is what it is it's just our tolerance and our what weight and our understanding of what it is so when we talk about medical cannabis it's what the intent is of it what it's used for so it's it's it's put into a controlled growing in a controlled environment and it's prescribed to say look if you take five mils of this or if you do this with this product we believe this will be the effect versus recreational people don't necessarily know what they're consuming they don't know when they should stop consuming it and it's done for fun versus for medical reasons for relief so when it comes down to actual product there's no difference it's what we put on it as a human being our perceptions and our choices what we put on that product with the roots it's like alcohol if I choose to drink five bottles of wine I've got a problem if I have a sip of wine it's a different I mean I'm enjoying it on a different level I'm consuming it for different reasons because I like the taste or I like the social experience versus right I'm troubled I've got things I want to forget or I want to you know escape life for a while I'm going to consume so much of this that I can escape you're coming from two different places yes but I'm a lot of medical marijuana has just got CBD in it which doesn't really is you don't have a lot of fun that's very true that's very true um there's there's a lot of proponents that will talk about what's called you would have seen the things you've read talk about whole of plant and hold of plant does have THC no THC does have therapeutic benefits yes so you can consume so the Australian government said up to 2% of the product can be THC because that we don't believe will give you any any you know any climb the more THC the more likelihood you're gonna have a high right so you can still consume something that's 98% CBD 2 percent THC you're still consuming THC you're not going to get high for you it's so so don't discount THC from the product completely alright yeah ok but there are products out there that you don't need THC if you've got something symptoms where we know THC doesn't doesn't actually have a benefit to it then just consume the CBD yeah so so just make humans have got CBD receptors yeah like yeah yeah so yeah why it's interesting goddamn like yeah well we're built to consume this stuff we are that's your money that's that's that's you know sort of makes you a little frustrated yes so what a paleo man to had illegit is marijuana well good a bikes a nice both as well I guess you know most things I don't know that um this the CBD naturally occurs in a lot of plant products all right okay so I can take you across the road of the supermarket here and walk you down the fruit and veg all and say that one that one that one good exercise ginger turmeric Wow and they're all anti-inflammatory is that untrue can you stop right yeah I can go okay so is this stuff that bad I don't know and I wonder if that's what lights to trim to make that good well this it's built again with what our body is a bill to consumer yeah okay so um ground pepper has got products in it so there's all these on drug it aside it's it's a fascinating thing and it's also then you go to the the policing of it and roadside testing and driving with cannabis in your system and all that sort of stuff they're testing for THC because it's known that you can consume CBD which is you could you could have gone smoked you a joint that's got CBD strain in it and you'll pass the roadside test but you've consumed something that's think I lately HC yes yes so how does that work yes that's interesting because the test doesn't worry about CBD yep because it's naturally occurring substance what if you had that strain buddy two percent here she was just fine you still you still you you you would most likely have a positive result because it's not the tier seen component yeah now go back to UM the holding song yeah yeah I tend to jump around our last video so go back there yeah so your proposal was to set up a cannabis production plot yep which what a great idea is fantastic that's well it's empty now I think there's a group out of Victoria that have acquired it and they've got ambitions to turning into some sort of industrial park and consigned that homes will stay there in some capacity for the next five years because they wind down but no I just hope something good comes of it because it's a great it's a it's a it's an important asset it's an important area suburbs that's very important yes you know a job job replacement that can you know can occur hopefully that does happen out there but you know our discussions with hold and so we initially started off with the government you haven't said this is what we want to do make it happen found out that the state government had no control no influence over the decision making process really which is kind of fascinating from what the city make goes over what Holden did with it so Holden if the Holden chose to shut the gate put a padlock on it and walk away for forty years every day then that's their asset really so so we as a as a people gave this company millions and millions and millions of dollars and didn't think to have a control have some influence over the SAO they ever chose they own the land as well real estate yeah so you're dealing with a listing company they've got due process they have to follow I'm talking with one of the heads in in Hong Kong about what the disposal process would be we were in that conversation at the table and got you know over overcome by a superior bead which I won't go into too much okay so he was all about money at the end of the day yeah yeah yes so what is it for the most part that's right they've got shareholders - yes and you know the number number I I was comfortable with and was in the ballpark well then didn't end up being anywhere near close Wow so did the gut the government cuz I heard the government handed the whole thing is that true no no no so this this the state government's actually been quite proactive we've got we're the only state in Australia that's got an office of industrial hemp and medicinal cannabis so we actually have government people that I can call up and say tell me about this help me with that no other states got that we've got the least restrictive regulations when it comes to the doctors and GPS mm-hmm they unfortunately it goes on to buy the national laws so so the the state government has been proactive and if they did have some influence or control I think the situation holdings may have ended up completely differently we might have ended up with somewhat Tom's they where Mitsubishi were and that's turned into a government asset that there rebirthing in creating industry and really incubating jobs and and that out of because it's a fantastic facility a fantastic outcome Holden's just become a straightforward real estate commercial play the government could have put their hand up as they have some other assets clips all and Koroma and and tried to secure it themselves and reposition it themselves but they left it to the marketplace to work out what what to do with it yes the Israel opportunities for medical cannabis growth in Australia of substrata do you really need yeah doesn't have to be on not have to be indoors not well it should be I think if we look at what's happening over in the US if you have an open field growing you open to contamination oh yeah pests but also you know whether it's other plants just see to fly through the wind all of a sudden in amongst your grow that's a challenge security is another issue as well you know all the sudden won't take people to know where these acres of cannabis being grown so they want a grown indoors and very minimum that means greenhouses okay so do I grow opium indoors in Des Moines I am yeah but you know you can't go on steel you know five opium plants and go to your local guy of course if you got a better processor you've there's a hole all right so that marijuana what you do is grab the bat yeah I mean you've got you know you've got potentially tens of thousands of dollars sitting in here in your backpack you know opium different so that that's the difference and do the opportunity exists absolutely we're constrained locally at the moment by the federal laws and the federal set up and and you know we knew day one that the way the federal rules were going to be set up was going to be problematic I offered to fly someone from the US who wrote the laws in Colorado California Washington I said this is where the strating government's going to come out he said mate I need to get on a plane and get down there because they don't know what they're doing yeah yes you know get me down they get me in front of these people and I'll take care of it I offered that don't need it mm-hmm does it stand out probably haven't got it quite right because you want to learn from someone that's all these justices isn't that what you're doing business you go oh I want to know how to you know how to do X I'll go and study the guys are did x4 build electric cars right now probably gone look at what a long mask did hmm reverse engineer what he did versus don't know that the wheel that's right what problems you'd learn fast you know versus failing and so I think a lot of people find common sense in that approach to a lot of different things but in Australia we seem to think we can do things differently sometimes for some reason that I'm yet to work out so what are your new plans are you trying to still move forward you the whole idea of you know setting up a facility and then providing that service yes yeah I've got I've got a freehold commercial property that is awaiting licensing at the moment and we intend to import our own product from overseas in the meantime until we can get a set up and selling yeah or groin and we've also got a arrangement with local higher tertiary institution to do some research into it as well so we're very well positioned to take advantage we just need a couple of more balls to drop them drop down for us but there's very out there waiting to be yep they're for hitting the national market oh the million market is gonna be swamped isn't it from yeah we've also got relationships in the u.s. already um where where it's amazing what happens when you go to American and you go to some of these conventions and you say I'm from Australia you get all the sudden you're sitting at the table with the big boys saying right tell us about what's going on so I've got some amazing connections to some real influential people in the cannabis industry in the u.s. also got into connections to sports stars in the u.s. were very vocal in this space so looking to activate those things and those relationships because you know as you know businesses network that's right you know and so you know take advantage of those and I don't know where it's gonna go but I think it's gonna be a big year and where we sit today Australia and South Australia by the time Christmas comes around I think when we do dealing and talking about a very different dynamic really yeah very confident so I knew sooner or later we'll get there but I thought Australia's pretty slow oh no it's it's as simple as a government coming out and saying we touched on before we started speaking about you could grow 10 plants South Australia for personal use so we've already shown in South Australia we've actually got a tolerance for this okay so we know where the bandwidth sort of the rules are huh so all it would take is for someone to come and say you know what we've already decriminalized that now this is what we're gonna do and all of a sudden I've got an industry mmm-hmm yeah well right so but but you put yourself in the shoes of the politicians that have to sell that story and they're flying in the face of seventy years of telling people like us educating people like us this is bad it's gonna rot your brain it's gonna do this it's gonna be a gateway drug if you're a go you're gonna end up being a prostitute because you smoked a joint that's the stuff that we used to get to right well and now all of a sudden I want that politician to stand at the front of my facility and say sorry about that we've haven't got it quite rightful are saying that guys this is actually really good and gonna provide a lot of jobs alone yeah yeah it's a really hard PR yes because the politicians gonna happen to do a backflip on their stance yeah well that's that's happening you know Australia we see Richard Dean Italia with the Greens he's really he's an MD he's a doctor thing gets it he gets it and he's really going in heart because what was voted on in Canberra this is what we've got after it's been through the the the bureaucratic process very very different to what the intention was and so that's where I think we've got a number of you know the troops are surrounding the castle yep and there's there's once the first state falls the rest will go and it's a matter of food from in my opinion it's a matter of who goes first and I think South Tralee could be positioned to go we we could we could we could do that at the moment I mean we're about to have an election yeah that's our chart and we've got a whole Dark Horse coming in Nick set up on out of the blue yep which is really gonna upset the applecart because we've been under Labour for a very long time yep it looked like it was gonna change the liberal but now who knows what's gonna that's and that's where all the polls that get done you know whether it's the local media Morgan Gallup polls just the man on the street the clipboard all of them come back ninety percent in favor of decriminalizing or legalizing cannabis yeah so yeah you're a political party let's all the sudden gone from a strong position or ambitions of being elected and you've put in this [ __ ] Xenophon character into into the mix all of a sudden the dynamics change all of a sudden you've got a look at things that are populist because you knew yeah there's an interesting dynamic very interesting I mean yeah Jay Weatherill is a very smart politician and he knows I mean recently did the biggest battery in the world yep and got all that publicity from kept so much negative publicity and these but round and now he's a bit of a hero yeah did a great job of it must has a politician he's very good and that's why I guess they've been in power for how long now oh this will be their 16th year that's a long time to be in pen on one stage yeah that also comes that you get a clumsy clunky machine sitting behind it and you also build a machine that's very good at protecting yourself ok yes which is interesting so a little part of the challenges if you had someone in for too long it can get style yeah but yeah they've become very good at marketing very good that's one thing yeah yeah yeah yeah absolutely you know a once they've been that well that's what they're really good at but he wants one good a government as well I'm not just marketing that's right because the government's more important government yeah that's a whole your your company and what you're setting up here in a delay when do you think that will be open to investors um well we've we're talking to some some listed companies at the moment that see before them see some synergy and what they're doing and what we're trying to achieve so I'm that in that space now do we stay private do we take on and their opportunity of listing a little baby and trying to watch it grow and hopefully watch a walk and then run and all that and so it's it's a very interesting space just because a lot of money is floating to this this category on this on the stock market so it's creating a lot of a lot of attention is very popular at the moment and I think could be a good investment what do you think with no medical marijuana because it's yeah well I'll be obviously I'm spending my time and capital on effort so I mean the answer is a yes if you're Joe public and looking for investment opportunities is it as good as anything else you've got to be comfortable with what you were doing and do your own research you know it's it's a space I don't believe is gonna go away anytime soon I think it's only gonna get stronger and you know you see the numbers coming out of the US and Canada they're just the the big numbers that they said a way off the mark they're like we thought it was gonna be five billion but now we're revising it to 8 billion Wow it's really easy to say there's three billion dollars difference between the two numbers which is ridiculous but when you say in their sentence it doesn't sound much but when you think of it Wow and that's how much they think they've underestimated the marketplace so it's got massive potential it's huge it's huge it's it's one of those things that like you know go back to the prohibition of alcohol once that came yeah yeah where does that sit now Danny all right because the alcohol companies really that started then they were huge yeah yeah there's and I think that's how you know that's how 2000s version of the 1900 we had a pre bitted product that was once legal we prohibited it created a huge black market and huge crime and huge negativity around it if we accept it in Australia as others have done it's amazingly do you think could be bigger than the alcohol but look at the numbers numbers that I'm reading it just amazes me that got such a big market huge but but when you look at what's happening the u.s. alcohol sales go down because when they usually using cannabis for the recreation that's oh yeah they you know in California instead of coming around for some bees and watching the game you go around and have some and chill out with your mates and that's what well it's got that inverses the negative effects of alcohol you know that so there's there's a whole you know I can almost count any argument with data and with with facts it was one of the ones that had don't enjoy but you know he's prevalent moment he's drugged driving you know where that was in substrate very hot on drug driving yeah well the data in the US actually says the road toll goes down 11% when you legalize cannabis really well yeah people that are stoned drive really slow than that exactly exactly exactly and I had a toxicologist you see your true it's right it's right how did toxicologist call me and their company does the drug testing for major major brands you don't need to drug testing all they do is sort of that car going really slow that's that's right because and this guy he said what's your take on I looked at my thoughts and I said what's your take any simple we're really struggling with it because we'd actually don't think it does anything bad we actually think it improves he said but I can't go to the head of a major airline and say you know what the pilot that's got 400 people on his plane it's probably gonna be okay really because that is not a good story in the market so they think you're safer if you start he even go eat what I get that because you're less likely to make rash decisions of course you do because you're you actually your decision make you know people have been in accidents talk about how slow it happens because awesome I don't know what it is inside our body and you know I'm sure medical professionals could tell me but you know I've been in you know in a big car accident and I can take you through that step by step cuz you're the same block that went for 15 seconds you rather he was it was I've been there I understand that you know I mean and so I can tell you what my hands were doing what I was looking at what I said what I what was on my lap at the time I can tell you all that stuff but the noise was what happened to the car I could tell you all that stuff because it just load down and I don't know if that's something that's built in us when we were in our that fight or flight situation where where the world slows down so we can actually process the process what's going on and make better judgment decisions I don't know but I think definitely sounds sounds interesting absolutely however when you're starting your action Tom saw two though isn't it sure yeah sure but yeah okay interesting there's something in that I don't know what it is yet but the darkness is it's not the evil thing that we think it is No well people have started I'm not really a minister Society angry they become chill and fifty percent of hospitalizations in Australia I related to alcohol really okay what is going on fifty percent fifty percent yeah that sure there's an alcohol involved something in their place when you aren't there cool I've done some stupid stuff in it yeah cuz you're brave and you can take on the world and nothing can go wrong mmm-hmm anything Wow like if we took that out of the society I'm not saying completely but you know if it was tempered what what impact does that have on the health society what impact does it have an eye on physicians and the nursing and the there's huge benefits in them it's fascinating like you can just go down these rabbit holes upon rabbit holes with this stuff because the data says is it's it's critical to our future almost yep hmm okay fascinating stuff Ben thank you so much for joining us today on the show find you um boring people on Twitter with her relentless cannabis facts and my thing is that benefits begin if I tease it my company is weekend WEC Oh mm yeah well put those in the show notes school where people can find you and yeah thanks for joining us and opening up the discussion it's been a pleasure thank you thank you to our second listing see you next week [Music] if our listing thank you once again stay well and see you next episode for awesome info and trending content go to the ugly truth log"

I'd be taking my kids to Disneyland instead I found myself at canvas boot camp and it was a fantastic event I did expect everyone to be there to have dreadlocks and be wearing tie-dye and I was quite pleasantly surprised there was a lot of scientists there and they're doing some amazing things we did some cannabis so first up big disclaimer I'm not a cannabis user I've never used it medically spiritually recreationally or otherwise my poison of choice is beer I love beer it gives me flawless dance moves and makes my jokes funnier and this picture here is one of our first trips to the US where we went to Portland OR Portland as I like to call it and we went on a cycling brewery tour was a really fun day we got to sample a lot of craft brews and the very same company who did this Southie brewery tour also offered a cycling cannabis tour with a visit of three cannabis dispensaries and gave all participants a joint an edible at the end we didn't do that true but it looked kind of fun and a lot of the harm statistics I'm going to be present to you presented shortly compare alcohol this is cannabis canvas doesn't really barely know them going to get up at all in time soon so in my education ethical professional in cannabis was along the lines of pharmacy students wherever at a party and someone lit up a joint were to leave their party immediately and no one ever did it became kind of a running joke but you first forward to modern day one my current pharmacist her education in cannabis was presented in half now format by a policeman which covered all illicit drugs which I don't see is really scientific and it's kind of like a nun giving you a class in sex education so we're hoping to change some of that today you'll laugh at this but my first introduction to medicinal cannabis what really sparked my interest was the most unscientific of journals Facebook I came across it is a Maine which quoted actual death statistics from the US third year 2012 and I was quite shocked to the results rather very top you've got cancer sticks and sitting on couches the usual suspects are responsible for a lot of people dying Ishi yes underneath that my favorite beer which has got quite a big toll but the one that really surprised me was prescription drugs largely pharmaceutical opioids which are responsible for over 30,000 deaths each year in the US and I see these is preventable guilty it's a massive toll and I'm told that that was in year 2012 in 2017 it was close to 50,000 sodas in the true sense of word and epidemic now this name showed cannabis right down the very bottom on zero and I thought no way and not be true how can a drug that is that dangerous that pharmacist have to leave parties because of leave that safe and it turns out cannabis is very difficult to overdose on you have to eat something like a ton of the stuff to overdose on I don't quite believe the figures des rois some poor person out there somewhere may be allergic to cannabis but it is very difficult to overdose on and you have to have very large volume and to overdose on this very few if even though we call the deaths involving medicinal cannabis and that doesn't mean all cannabis users safe all the time so to prove a point we called some Australian data also from the year 2012 the very trouble this line so which was spots or a big time not shopping read the numbers here but underneath that they were in the year 2012 577 people died in Australia from overdosing on pharmaceutical opioids and right down the very bottom on zero was cannabis so there's a bit of a trend forming here in terms of the cute little toxicity how this chart works the figure on the Left which is always one is the amount of a drug required to give effective dose the figure on the right is how many of those choices it takes to kill you Rhonda very trophy is heroin on one tooth teeth which is the most dangerous and alcohol sitting on one to ten in practical terms for beers might get you drunk 40 beers might kill you further down we've got caffeine one two fifty and write down the very bottom we've got cannabis on one two greater than 20,000 so one joint might get you high over 20,000 joints would overdose you so if you could afford 20,000 genes and you may come close to overdosing on campus now I always thought cannabis was highly addictive it turns out it's a lot lower on the scale than I thought the most addictive substance on this scale anyway is heroin closely followed by its cousin methadone further down we've got alcohol and nicotine they're both quite addictive substances and right down on the right hand side a is cannabis cannabis it's on 0.8 on the addiction scale caffeine is not on this scale but if it was on here be 0.9 so in practical trans cannabis is less addictive than coffee very surprising chemist was widely sold in pharmacies circa 1930s it was widely used for some of the same things were rediscovering now like chronic pain he was used for childhood epilepsy and was used for cancer pain patients and I've seen some of these bottles sitting in in old shell and I didn't think much of the time but a lot of these names I did a bit of research on them they were pharmaceutical companies that I remember when I first started in pharmacy and a lot of them have evolved and merge and a growing since then and I I pulled up the times and they're now a big pharmaceutical companies that made their start still in cannabis they no longer sell cannabis but they might well one day in the near future what happened now in 1934 the u.s. legalized alcohol that meant there was a big government Parliament sitting around doing nothing and previously they said there was not a problem with cannabis use it did not cause harm in society but once they feel themselves unemployed it was a different story and they went after cannabis largely on the basis of an unscientific movie called reefer madness and proclaimed that cannabis users were violent and sex-crazed at the time the American Medical Association spoke out against them that said no we actually use it as a medicine it's got valid medical uses and there's a lot of things we're researching is useful but they're overruled and cannabis was banned many other countries around the world followed suit 1:42 chemist was removed from the US pharmacopoeia now the canvas plan itself is quite complex there's over 50 different ingredients and they include waxes to name the cannabinoids and cells and chlorophylls there's too many ingredients in pharmaceutical terms THC which is the bit that is a psychoactive potentially and CBD which is non psychoactive and it's got a lot of medical uses and most pharmaceutical products will contain an issue of these two ingredients there's also a bunch of another collab annoys many which are still being investigated they haven't enough to be studied for last 80 years because a product prohibition that scientists are slowly unlocking some of the mysteries the intra cannabinoid system I'd never heard of and it turns out our body has a homeostatic system called the endocannabinoid system which is only deciding to be taught in medical schools now what's that's covered in the mid-nineteenth and there's two cannabinoid receptors cb1 and cb2 CB ones mainly found in the brain and CB 2 is found in vital organs and the skin now our body produces natural cannabinoid chemicals and noun to mine and to AG and they work on receptors and they can enter a cannabinoid system and control such things as appetite the immune system and pain which explains a lot about what cannabis does because the cannabis and chemicals mimics these natural injury cannabinoid so unlike opioids there's no cannabinoid receptors in the part of the brain or the brain stem which regulates the heart rate and breathing so it's much safer to keep large doses especially in palliative care where you might need to increase the dose depending on how the patients are coping and what how how bad you need to to treat certain conditions now if you look at cannabis science you come across this term the entourage effect which is only a theory that not one ingredient works in one receptor at one time it's theorized that two or more cannabinoids work on in conjunction on one or more receptors at the same time now in medical terms there was a great article published in January 2017 by the National Academies of science engineering and medicine they're supposedly the world's biggest body of skeptics there's a lot of Harper trained professors we looked at what cannabis can and can't do and they looked at every bit of research ever done on cannabis and scaled from the anecdotal evidence that was biased high-quality evidence which in gold standard clinical trials with see bones etc and they came to the conclusion there were three areas where there was good clinical evidence of medical cannabis was of benefit the biggest one being chronic pain which accounts for about 70% of people using medicinal cannabis not only does medical cannabis help the pain of patients it also has quite a few other benefits in areas such as anti-anxiety it helps with insomnia it's helped spasm help us also in nausea so rather than a session being a gateway drug it is essentially an exit drug from phungster some pharmaceuticals and well you might decrease the pain medication you might reduce some of the other medications in conjunction with that now compared to opioids that 80% of opioids do not work in chronic pain they're really good for acute pain patients chronic pain they're not as effective and a lot of people get constipation up to 90% of patients get constipation with opioids for pain they're also highly addictive and they also can cause overdose in comparison so Mistel canvas has got good benefit in this particular area and the chemotherapy patients mostly there there's some really good drugs out there to prevent vomiting but when these patients experience a metallic like tongue nothing else works for none of the other standard nausea drugs tend to be very effective cannabis helps that low-level norcia these patients they feel when they're undergoing chemotherapy in terms of MS patients they get relief from spasm pain and they can sleep better at night time now since the January 2017 study there was a May 2017 study in it published in a New England Medical Journal on refractory epilepsy and cannabis and they studied some drove AIDS patients that had drug-resistant epilepsy that nothing else worked for and they found up to 40% of them with seizure free or greatly reduce seizures using medicinal cannabis of that is the fourth condition added to the list of drugs the medical cannabis can benefit there's many more under investigation these are some of them PTSD is wildly cannabis is widely used the PTSD in countries such as Israel Canada and the u.s. in Israel and Canada the government actually pay the war veterans to receive medical cannabis because they know it helps them and still requires a lot more research and a godsend clinical trial there's quite a bit of exciting research going on anti-cancer effects of cannabis and also anibus and chemotherapy in conjunction to achieve better patient outcomes now one the conditions I think it is really exciting that has been investigated currently is Alzheimer's our outside this is a massive condition that it's estimated one in ten patients above the age of 65 will experience out songs or dementia at some stage in a lifetime and in pharmaceutical terms we don't have many drugs to benefit these patients we've got a arsenal drugs that no cure is only for Alzheimer's and very few drugs short of tranquilizing these patients to make life easy to their carers now if it has been from low-level study and and some anecdotal research that showing medical cannabis and may be a benefit in these patients so I'd like to see a lot more research in these areas like any drug cannabis has drug interactions there's four main areas at this stage there's no major contraindications I say currently because it is a developing science and there may be something that comes up down the track cannabis affects blood thinners like warfarin so whilst it isn't a no-no to take cannabis were you taking blood thinners you may need to check the levels more frequently canvas is metabolized by cytochrome p450s or anything else metabolized by this route might need consideration chemicals so inclusive main cause drowsiness and lower blood pressure so any other medications effective affecting these might need to be monitored pharmacokinetics is a really interesting area now what my siblings studied has been smoked cannabis and the chemical ingredient EHD so there's a lot more work going on this area and now what we know so far is smoking cannabis isn't a very good delivery method medically oral tends to be much better when you smoke cannabis yet massive amounts almost instantly and most of that's eliminated within a short period of time within a couple of hours may be any body in trace amounts for up to a couple weeks afterwards but in medical terms you only get an effective dose within two hours of the chronic long-term patients they might need all-day relief so oral is a far more effective method to give medicine cannabis and the stomach as a huge first passed effect from their asset and there is little by availability but it will last longer sublingually is a great method to give medicinal cannabis is absorbed through the oral mucosa and you're avoiding the first class effect from the stomach get high bioavailability actually we also get goodbye availability without the psycho activity of THC but commercially Rachel administration isn't that popular I think you're gonna see a lot more topical best products in the future and the molecular weight of THC is less than 400 so it is coming by the skin and there's a lot of sea beauty food receptors in the skin and so it does achieve good medicinal benefits this chart here and accurately shows the difference between smoking cannabis which as I said is not a good delivery method medically and that is because it only works for about an hour you achieve to hire a dose of THC and quite often you get psycho activity especially in the first half an hour or so which is an ideal for patients who are taking cannabis medically their objective in treatment is to get help rather than high so when you take it orally in the blue line it takes about a hour before it clicks in you can make this a bit faster by taking it sublingually when it's absorbed through the oral mucosa but you get good long low levels over a 24-hour period like a blood pressure tablet or an antibiotic where the idea is to have a long blog Berg still getting a clinical dosage are you getting good medical benefits over a 24-hour period and then you might take another dose each day to maintain that curve and maintain the benefits medically so in summary I don't consider smoking to be a very good delivery method orally is far better so in those forms medically moving forward I don't think you'll see as much flour or bad smoked cannabis and in the throat anyway there's probably only about 10% of people who actually smoked so they prefer other dosage forms like sublingual tablets capsules you can see oil sprays tinctures and left foam as reasons poultries now here's a neat bit of technology coming out of Israel it's a slightly enhance the X Y Q P there's a great video on YouTube it's the inhaler being developed for cannabis that connects up to a smartphone and that way the doctor can monitor the patient's dosage and the patient can also have a record of what cannabis they're using when and to what effect and it's a great piece of technology and I think you'll see a lot more of it not only in cannabis users but also other areas like asthmatic patients etc this Canadian grow room and medically cannabis needs to be grown the same from batch to batch that way patients get the same medication every single time and it is really really important because chronically ill patients need to have consistent levels of THC and CBD and by growing it indoors you're controlling the season so the plants get the same amount of sunlight we're on official light in this case water nutrients airflow pH et cetera and you're also preventing pesticides and it's that's important because since pesticides introduced to the plant they might be concentrated when you concentrate the oil so it's important to grow them this way also by growing this way means they get to six crop turns a year they can turn a clock in six to eight weeks which economically is important when they extract the the bud or the flower these machinery like this is co2 extraction equipment they may need to further clean it up using ethanol extraction I'm the jar on the left hand thumb yellow mark in that the the rule cameras that comes out of the extraction they may further clean it up and get rid of the waxes and the chlorophyll and from there the jar on the right is the good stuff at the end which they will formulate and medicate to the patient in standardized dosage terms now I consider cannabis to be a pharmaceutical disrupter for some patients it offers benefit where there's no other treatment options it can help quite a number of patients and there's some really exciting stuff being developed I think gonna see a lot more of it in in the future some of this research comes online and it's a really as I say exciting area of medicine that I'm really enjoying looking at and traveling the world with so thank you very much for listening to me and talk about medical cannabis I look forward to answering any of your questions thank you thank you Paul for that informative presentation we will now start the live Q&A portion of the webinar if you have a question you'd like to ask please do so now just click on the ask a question drop-down box located on the far left of your presentation window type your question into the box that appears on your screen and click the send button we'll answer as many questions as we have time for so let's get started with our first question our first question asked can cannabis cure cancer I hope so there's a lot of research taking place at the moment and one of the Israeli scientists I know is doing a lot of work in this area he summarized it to me that it is a very difficult thing to quantify because if hundred different types of cancer all innovating different diseases so he's testing every single type of cannabis on every single type of character and trying to get some answers there now I often look how many strains well how many types of cancer do you hope to secure and he said well realistically he's looking at four types of cancer of the hundreds of types of cancer that he'll hopefully be able to cure I know he's done some preclinical work he's done some work on rats totally restarting human trials and there's a number of other researchers around the world doing doing work as well as I mentioned there's some really great work taking place in my hometown on cannabis and chemotherapy they're looking at pancreatic cancer models we just got a very low survival rate and and there's been some really good anecdotal cases they're basing their research on so hopefully that they will get some answers there and people will get and benefit excellent thank you and our next question asks what strains are best for pain hi I'm not a big fan of strains I think in terms of pain you're gonna see more THC and CBD levels moving forward a lot of australians are purely marketing where they've done a bit of work and research and even those strains that are called the same they contain varying amounts of THC and CBD food typically the best for pain creates you need to treat all the symptoms as I said to you if a patient's experiencing nausea you might need to include loads of more THC but typically what we're seeing for the most common patients they're getting a high CBD forma with small amounts of THC and if you need more nausea control you might need a higher amount of THC like a one to one level that's and some great farmers out there with all with different amounts of THC and CBD rather than strains excellent thank you if there are no more questions I'd like to once again a thank Paul mayor for his presentation I would also like to thank lab roots for making today's educational webcast possible before we go I want to let everyone know that today's webcast will be available for on-demand viewing through June of 2018 you will receive an email from

JFloqyn73T4,How Does Medical Cannabis Relate To Schizophrenia | Medical Marijuana Experts At DocMJ,2018-11-27T16:38:47Z,[Music] hi I'm dr. Rothman welcome to medical marijuana experts at doc MJ today's question is how does cannabis medical cannabis relate to schizophrenia schizophrenia is a mental condition that is largely genetic that can be very debilitating it can involve hallucinations it can involve other mental issues schizophrenia is possibly treated medically in 2 out of 3 cases but in 1 out of 3 cannot be treated medically it can lead to debilitation to the point where a patient cannot function how does cannabis relate to schizophrenia well the THC in cannabis is probably not good for schizophrenia THC alone in high doses can cause schizophrenic symptoms in normal patients in patients with schizophrenia the THC can make it worse can bring it on however the CBD which is the second component of cannabis has been successfully used to manage schizophrenia in many cases and is recommended for that purpose in terms of the research done there is no direct cause and effect of THC causing schizophrenia but people with schizophrenia have gotten worse with THC only the CBD however has been used to treat the schizophrenia so the take home is this if I have a patient who comes in I will always ask no matter what the concern is that the patient has whether he has a history of schizophrenia if he does he will not get THC cannabis he will get CBD cannabis I will ask the patient if there is a family history of schizophrenia and if there is either in a parent or a sibling he will not get THC cannabis he will only get CBD cannabis now I should mention this in the year and a half that I've been doing cannabis medicine I have had two patients come in for revisits their initial visits were with other physicians who would place them on THC cannabis and these patients had actually done quite well with the THC cannabis one was a 25 year old who was having auditory hallucinations he was he was hearing things and he came in with his parent and he stated I'm so much better however I felt my hands were tied based on the the current knowledge and I was not able to give him a continuing recommendation for THC he was very disappointed as was the other patient who had been on THC and I hope in the future there'll be more research done so that we can take care of these patients better I treat the patient as a normal regular patient the patient has already filled out a history and physical and a complaint list and has documented the severity of the complaints I will review this with the patient I will based on on the findings on the history I would do a physical exam that that addresses the issues for instance if the patient has low back pain I will examine for straight leg raising to see if there's any spinal cord problems I will examine the muscles of the back to see if there's any spasm or tenderness if the patient complains that he's had bad knees or bad hands I will examine for evidence of arthritis if the patient says that well I I've had surgeries in the past I'll look for the scars I will always go to ephors which is a website run by the state that has a listing of all the patients narcotics that he's been prescribed throughout the pharmacies of Florida so if a patient tells me he's had no care and no drugs and I go to that site and he's full of drugs on that site then I know there's a problem at the end of that evaluation I can make my own determination of whether this patient merits recommendation based on the story and the physical findings if I'm not comfortable with that then I can ask the patient to see a primary care physician and I would then review those records once they were available if the patient has a mental issue such as anxiety and I'm uncomfortable with my evaluation I will ask him to have a mental evaluation which could be done by a primary care but could also be done by any County Health Department mental health unit and then I would evaluate that as well so at the end of the day I will evaluate the patient decide whether to recommend right then and I have the option to send the patient for further evaluation now the corollary to this is the patients who may not have the records handy at the time of the visit and I will treat the patient the same way and at the end of the evaluation if I'm comfortable recommending the patient I will and if not I will wait for those records to come so that's what we do with patients without medical records for more information visit our website at doc MJ comm and subscribe below to follow our Channel [Music]
nbl7-yj_HKE,The race to riches for Australia’s new marijuana moguls | Four Corners,2018-04-30T06:51:24Z,"I got thrown out off I hope you're recording this no less than five Investment Banking officers they thought I was insane like get out get out Ross Smith is not your average investor a guy like me I'm like the first wife you know to the commandos we like a didn't Australia kick the door down it's a Tuesday morning and Smith's on his way to the home he calls his mountain lair high in the hills of New Zealand's North Island am i making money yes of course it works for nothing a venture capitalist for two decades Smith has taken a wild ride through the early days of Australia's legal marijuana business I was heavily involved in the last comm room and I never actually thought I'd see another boom like it but this this green rush or gold rush or whatever you want to call it now is simply remarkable it's it's going to be absolutely huge Smith's home is one of 10 New Zealand properties he says he's bought with the millions he's made from marijuana investments with his beloved $300,000 Bentley in the garage he's living the dream but it wasn't always this way here's the funny part back in 1989 I was arrested and charged for cultivating cannabis with intent or seller supply along with possession of cannabis with intent to sell supply I'm at the time 11 kilos and my house was a little bit shall we say above personal use but I think I'm the only guy in world history that was fined so having a cannabis conviction as a cannabis mogul it's simply an occupational hazard it's nothing to worry about all right talk to me Smith floated the first cannabis company on the Australian Stock Exchange in 2015 but he quit its board just two weeks later after being accused of making a death threat on Facebook to a critic of the deal Smith insists he was hacked all very colorful you know that sort of thing is three years ago those sorts of guys they are inherently jealous and it's about as worrisome as a cloudy day mate and seriously no truth to it no no whatsoever the bill as it stands the bill as it stands even as it's before the steering committee now it's there in black and white today Smith's hatching his latest medicinal cannabis deal it's gonna become like fish oil he wants to export the plant from Queensland into New Zealand after the Kiwis legalized medicinal cannabis later this year principally we're gonna supply out of Australia via license for Siddeley Smith is a medicinal cannabis evangelist spooking it as a new wonder drug seizures taken care of rheumatoid arthritis I mean even pets I saw a video this morning I don't know with you saw it that boxer dog was having seizures and the guy gave it a go gave it a little I drop of CBD oil and bang brought the dog straight out of seizures he had a normal dog again since Smith's first venture the value of listed Australian cannabis companies has soared to one and a half billion dollars may eventually all pharmacies will stock it Smith's not the own one attracted to the scent of big money there's dodgy companies everywhere yeah I mean I often say in the in the spec end of the market I mean there are wolves in the forest if you can't handle the fact that there's wolves in the forest don't go to the forest it's real simple stick to stick to bhp Rio Tinto ANZ national straight back are you one of those wolves I am called the wolf but I am I am in the market for all the right reasons back in Australia the medicinal cannabis industry is starting from scratch working hard to build a clean corporate image thank you this is the place this is the place in an outer Melbourne suburb we're visiting Australia's first licensed medicinal cannabis growing rooms [Music] it's a high-security environment with no external signs to indicate what's going on inside we can't identify these workers in case they're targeted by criminals the federal government's Office of Drug Control bans anyone with connections to illegal marijuana from working here cultivators and our cultivation team can't have had any experience with cannabis before that's part of the screening process we do on the way through so you haven't been able to go out and say if you've been growing cannabis illegally and you have a level of expertise please come and work with us I've been approached by plenty you've said I'm really good at growing this how do I get involved in the legal side of the industry step one is don't apply it doesn't won't won't cut it with the Office of Drug Control the number of plants growing here and their varieties are secrets closely guarded by the listed company that owns them can group so Shawn come on have a look through here so this is the start of our process we've got the mother plants grower here is just working on propagation stage so what we're doing is taking cuttings from the mother plants go into the propagation cubes can groups CEO Peter Kroc spent over 20 years in agribusiness developing farm products now he's growing high-grade marijuana this is one of three growing sites owned by kin group it's hoping to harvest up to six crops a year in terms of agriculture scale is everything doesn't matter if it's growing wheat or or what it is we know that and and that's that's what we're looking at we need to set up at scale and be able to play in that space can group is growing cannabis for a surprising customer the Victorian government the plants being harvested here will become medicine in a government trial for children with severe epilepsy last Jia can group secured the first Australian cannabis licenses boosting its market value to four hundred million dollars if you look at a company such as the can group which listed in May last year at 30 cents a share is now trading at three dollars so from a capital gains perspective people who bought those shares at 30 cents have have done very very well assuming they've sold it unlike most so-called pot stocks can group has attracted interest from the big end of town its backers include Elliston capital part owned by billionaire James Packer with a shareholding worth 6 million dollars there's also global investment bank Canaccord Genuity which helped float can group and holds a six million dollar stake what's getting investors excited is is this is the ability to be on the cusp of a clearly emerging industry where there will be a whole bunch of new economic activity and obviously great investment opportunities as a result of that but it's still some way from making a profit could you hazard a guess that when you expect to turn a profit no I won't hazard a guess at that in the moment so we're just focused on making sure we can get get our crops through this small facility if you do have a company that is consuming cash that you know it's not absolutely clear what the demand when the demand will be and what the revenue when that revenue will kick in that is a speculative investment and you know people go people are happy to put that in with the understanding that it is risky but if the risk plays out they could make a lot of money on australia's west coast researchers are about to explore one of the myriad possible medical uses for cannabis unlocked by the end of prohibition funding the research is Harry karelis who's got a science degree and 25 years experience in the finance industry I can see it through the lens of not only from a medical perspective but also from a capital markets and investment perspective so when the two meet when you see a brand new industry opening up globally and you see that it's inevitable it's coming to Australia and there's no reason it shouldn't come to Australia then that presents an investment opportunity karelis has spent 18 months convincing state and federal health authorities to give the green light to a pioneering clinical trial in a world-first researchers at the University of Western Australia are about to test whether a cannabis medicine can treat insomnia we see insomnia as a market or a condition that we have a high degree of confidence that will respond to cannabis therapy it's a big market in its own right I think one in six people suffer from some kind of sleep disorder and insomnia is one part of that that fraction the anecdotal evidence is certainly out there that people feel as though they relax and can go to sleep using cannabis this one measures airflow through your nose and mouth 24 volunteers will be given cannabis for two weeks and a placebo for another fortnight ok finished products ok their sleep will be measured both in the lab and at home when advertising for participants researchers didn't mention they would be taking cannabis only revealing it after they volunteered none of them have said oh no I don't want to be involved they might have been a little bit surprised but they're not against using medicinal cannabis to treat their insomnia was that a little surprising to you yeah I thought that there might be a few people that would say oh no no I can't I can't use that I'm not interested but we haven't was experience then okay Debbie I'm gonna get you to lay there with your eyes closed okay one problem with cannabis being illegal for so long is the lack of hard data about its medicinal effects as more countries legalize its use clinical trials like this are starting to become more common that's great now staring at a spot on the ceiling again karelis company is also running a trial in Chile for autism and in Spain it's researching treatment for breast cancer it's gonna be a multi-billion dollar market in total but it's gonna be a build up of lots of players selling an insomnia product in Germany and an autism product in Canada and and you add that up it's a multi-billion dollar market for sure karelis is a founder of another West Australian cannabis company walls can rivals can group as Australia's biggest cannabis company also with a market value of about 400 million dollars about that size that's happening everywhere right it was founded by a politician former federal Liberal MP and avocado grower mal washer so basically these will be picked as you know beginning of August washer had a job convincing his family to join him including his microbiologist daughter Elaine Darby so I got them involved said how about this right now they thought it was a fruit loop right I mean you know I went into federal politics how I say what they said about that it was not favorable can't be repeated in camera this had the same reaction what does he hit his head or something you don't ring up low and said what the hell's happening now yeah he's not taking this stuff or anything stranger anyway most Australians they haven't really if they haven't had anything to do with cannabis at all that if you're suddenly broached to say hey the family's going into the the cannabis business you know you use a little surprising - to be quite honest here's a problem we have all scam plans to grow cannabis and produce a medicine targeting chronic pain but when it started out there was a problem none of the team had any experience growing marijuana you've got in an industry where you know you have the the doctors and the scientists and our pharmaceutical team but we're here and we know how to make pharmaceuticals we still need cannabis genetics and the problem is the only place you'll find cannabis genetics to kick off unfortunately is some real colorful characters so it's one of those really bizarre industries where you're getting this interface with these individuals [Music] the company hired a cult figure in the global marijuana underground a man once dubbed the king of cannabis Australian Neville Shan makers never was a fascinating person yes king of cannabis is kind of naming in the industry and he had expertise he had access to genetics there is some particular kind of Australians that are named after him still today you know there's Neville's haze and all these various weird and wonderful Shawn makers gained global notoriety in the Netherlands as a cannabis breeder and seed merchants but in 1990 his global enterprise was targeted by US authorities who charged him with 44 drug offences so when mr. shoemakers came to Perth to visit his family he was arrested at Perth Airport on an extradition treaty between Australia and America he has committed no crime in Holland and no crime in Australia Shawn makers was only released on bail after almost a year in a Perth jail I just want to live with trishing there Daniel and be happy while on bail sure and makers vanished the last time I saw him was at 5:30 on Tuesday afternoon and I haven't heard all same nonsense sure and makers fled the country and in 2003 the u.s. dropped the charges years later he returned to Australia and in 2014 became a founding shareholder in Ozcan how concerned were you initially about bringing somebody with that reputation into a company that you're trying to establish yeah look that's certainly something to consider I mean certainly he hadn't broken any Australian rules by any stretch of the imagination however yeah he did have the issue with the Americans for us it wasn't a problem initially were terms of what we're looking at doing there the company was looking to access xirn makers famous seed collection held in the Netherlands I mean his collection that he had in his day overseas was an enormous range of various varieties and strains of cannabis and when you're looking to wanting to produce a therapeutic product that's absolutely fantastic that you had that whole range of potential strains there that could produce all these different kind of compounds at the end of the day in return for the promise of his expertise the company gave Shawn makers 14 million shares and what did you get for that well we got a lot of entertaining lunches and dinners with never Wender but his seeds were never delivered unfortunately we were unable to access those at the end of the day and that was a lot due to the the rules and legislation in those particular countries where they were sitting they couldn't sort of be access so unfortunately had to move on from that [Music] filmmakers remains a large shareholder in Ozcan I think Neville is the number two or number three shareholder and I think on today's prices it must be thirty million dollars plus worth of worth of value [Music] ah scan is not the only company that has tried to capitalize on the king of cannabis is to go hey great to meet you let's singapore-based Philip GU is chief executive of stem-cell united a traditional Chinese medicine company with big plans to break into the cannabis market Ashland SR is about Joseph Penn and ahem right I didn't know that he was interested in him it's much more interested in what you think I what everybody knows okay yeah when stem cell first listed on the stock exchange it promised to make face masks infused with extracts from a rare orchid then in March last year stem cell hired shown makers is a medicinal cannabis consultant handing him ten million shares and a five thousand dollar monthly retainer his involvement as a racer and actually they give us confidence and knowledge and boost for our company's confidence and knowledge as well because his status everybody knows him king of cannabis the announcement sent the share price rocketing boosting the company's market value from four million to one hundred and thirty million dollars in a day six months later Shawn makers resigned as a consultant I think we've seen unfortunately space quite a few companies that have suddenly appeared out of no way they'll make an announcement share price spikes up everyone yeah we saw you know in these quick bucks that should be made so unfortunately there has been a bit of that going on is your company in this for the long term is it genuine about wanting to produce medical cannabis products or is it just in it for a bit of a quick buck we we have no intention to win those so-called quick backs and we won long term not only because my personal but also my profession and we were long-term and long long term are you we want to be in in the long term development meanwhile Neville Shawn makers is as elusive as ever we tracked him to the tiny northern New South Wales town of banal beau to try to get his side of the story but the king of cannabis was nowhere to be found mr. goood where is Neville shall makers now I'm not sure where he is now I don't know where Neville is um unfortunately I was spoken to him for years despite the money pouring into the cannabis industry patients are still struggling to access the drug since legalization in Australia in 2016 medicinal cannabis has only been prescribed to about 600 patients experts mostly blame complex state and federal rules the regulatory system is a complete basket case here in Australia each and every state has a different regulatory framework in place there's the federal you know TGA that also has a say so even if the GP feels that medicinal castor cannabis is the appropriate treatment for a patient it's in very very difficult to access it so there are huge barriers that need to be overcome before patients actually have access to medicinal cannabis here in Australia [Music] those barriers are forcing people like Jen and thousands like her to seek their own supplies outside the law every month Jen drives from her gold coast home across the New South Wales border to buy medicinal cannabis on the black market I feel actually very nervous making the journey not so much on the way there but particularly on the way back when I've got my products in hand Jen is dying from mesothelioma cancer caused by asbestos exposure it's a for products and they have specific uses she spends seven hundred dollars a month on medicine she says helps relieve pain and nausea and this is the strongest one Jen's oncologist can only prescribe her medicinal cannabis after securing permission from both federal and Queensland health authorities that takes time she doesn't have I understand it's a process that takes between 70 to 10 months which actually if you're a standard mesothelioma patient on a normal late diagnosis you've gone you don't live normally that long unfortunately and that's the sad truth how would you describe the current system inefficient bazan tine and to be honest quite obstructive and if you know if you look at what's been happening over the last 18 months where people have got frustrated is there has been a lot of political currency put out there in terms of we are going to provide access and bring materials in but that's not translated into the reality Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt has been a strong advocate of medicinal cannabis ten days ago he convinced the states to work towards a single national approval scheme basically we've got a one-stop shop process with New South Wales that proves that it can be done in under 48 and there should be no excuse for any state for not joining the one-stop shop process so essentially the states need to get out of the way look at my messages I respect deeply their approach but this is about patient access this is about ensuring that those people where the doctors make the decision that it's in the interest of the patient have the access to that material we've still got a long way to go to match the patient access schemes that are in place in some other parts of the world and how much of a risk does that present to your company and other companies in this industry yeah I guess if you're a stray lien domestic focused only that's a big risk if you're putting all your eggs in that one basket the prospect of the local industry stalling prompted a surprise announcement from Greg Hunt that Australian companies would be allowed to export medicinal cannabis our goal is very clear to give Australian farmers and manufacturers the best shot at being the world's number one exporter of medicinal cannabis what were your concerns about the viability of the domestic medicinal cannabis market that led you to bring forward the decision to allow companies to export oh well many companies have said that they would have a stronger position for cultivation and research and manufacturing in Australia if they had both a domestic and an international market I agreed with that I thought that would strengthen the Australian market but on an absolute condition that any company that's to be granted an export license would sign a guarantee that Australian patients would have first access the announcement fired up cannabis stocks within a week kangaroo its share price shot up by a third while oz cans more than doubled look the potential that is enormous I mean it opens us up to the whole world because what we're finding is that countries all over are now legislating to allow medical use of cannabis so it's sort of like all these countries are opening up all the time please give a rousing round of applause from canopy growth the largest arguably cannabis business on the planet Bruce Linton one international company investing in Australia is the five-and-a-half billion dollar Canadian firm canopy growth corporation its founder and CEO is Bruce Linton who is also a director of West Australian company Ozcan we tend to say that we are the largest producer of cannabis in the world that publishes their address Canada already has medicinal cannabis and later this year it will legalize marijuana for recreational use Linton was in Sydney recently to drum up investor interest reefer madness is over this crazy country this Mad Hatter place called Canada is doing it and I think it couldn't be a better place to launch it because you know we are a relatively well-mannered pretty boring we like structure our governments are going to be selling it so when you come to Canada next summer maybe about September you're going to line up at a store run by the state or provincial government all the employees and most of them will work for the government and they'll be per selling products that have been described and defined by the federal government and all you need to have is the money and your ID to say that you're over 19 that sanctions and validates a whole bunch of things that I think is gonna catch the globe and say wow user [Music] in Canada canopy growth is partnered with rapper Snoop Dogg to promote its medicinal cannabis products snoops just about to go on let's get it [Music] its main brand tweed even has a clothing line [Music] what is the vaccine canopy has registered the tweed trademark in Australia for both medicinal and recreational cannabis so is this very clearly a positioning for the potential advent of recreational use in Australia hey yeah we do it so every country that's federally illegal we think someday we'll start with medical and don't know when there's a path that they go to managing the whole topic and the reason is it isn't being introduced as a new thing bad news it exists everywhere in a large volume and so we think it's just a natural progression so Australia Germany everywhere if we've and and I got to keep track of my lawyers I don't keep track of how much they spend doing these things everywhere but it is kind of the mandate prepare for the future have things ready Linton's company has also hired top-tier lobbying firm Crosby texture to help it in discussions with Australian governments you have engaged an Australian lobbyist coffee texture yeah I think that's true yeah I'm just wondering what what you are using them for why gonna be totally truthful I can't I don't know exactly what we use them for in most countries is what we try to do is frame the Canadian experience and use indications of what worked a company called um canopy growth corporation which is a major shareholder in an Australian company called ozcan is listed on the register of lobbyists for the Australian Parliament using the firm Crosby texture I'm just wondering if you know why that would be and whether whether you've had any meetings with either Crosby texture or canopy growth I have met with international firms and I've met with Australian firms and what did they want to talk about people are all talking about access to the Australian market and understanding the regime in the northern New South Wales counterculture capital of nimbin people have been lobbying for the legalization of marijuana for decades the town's preparing for its annual Mardi grass festival a few that were stopped that's how we get them get people who come yeah I got no TV ad yeah Nym bands home to the hemp embassy a tourist attraction doubling as headquarters of the Australian hemp party today Michael hey girl long time no see it's secretary is Andrew kava sillas who's founded his own medicinal cannabis company he's also betting on marijuana being legalized for recreational use it's certainly on our mind would be you know a pretty dishonest company to not be thinking in that way and I think how in the natural course of the progression that we see I think you're gonna have to really be able to prove yourself as a as a good producer of medical grade cannabis before you can look to you know get into the recreational side we are certainly certainly hiring off recreational as another form of revenue in the future yep and how big do you think that market could be maybe 10 times our medical side yep Cavor sillas is a pioneer of the cannabis industry yeah staying here was of the mail yep and they're coming on really well you can see nicely oh there I'll produce a lot of pollen for these immature females we're still looking at here Keva sillas is licensed to grow these plants for his hemp food company they're low in THC marijuana's psychoactive ingredient so there is a female over here this one here pull it over what we're looking at here is actually first of the seeds the plants been pollinated the medicinal cannabis boom has catapulted the veteran campaigner headlong into the world of big business this has interrupted my normal job my normal vocation so yeah those benefits are greater but I've never been busier in all my life either I do a lot of traveling now I'm hardly the home I'm always in meetings and talking to people and conference calls last year mining company Queensland bauxite limited bought 55% of kava sillas medicinal cannabis startup to break into the market I see the potential of that deal to me personally will be quite beneficial if what we're saying comes to fruition I made you all wealthy man wealthier than I've probably ever been here at his home outside nimbin Cavis Allah says us one prize the mining company paid to access it's the holy grail of medicinal cannabis a rare seed back collected from around the world it's quite extensive some of the oldest ones that we have these kind of samples and these are from various regions in China even Yellow River and we actually had two different yellow rivers shengshi particular one called lulu some very old what was referred to as Indian hemp well Yellow River number three and then yet there was a European varieties that are very important calves asila seconds his seeds could deliver an even bigger payday any statistic you look at Australians enjoy using cannabis more than any other illicit drug and they decided to do it quite reasonably and responsibly and so on that fact alone it is inevitable that Australia will legalize tax and regulate recreational use of cannabis but other Australian companies aren't so sure given the potentially enormous size of the legal recreational market globally how likely do you think it is that Australia will eventually be compelled to move down that track as Canada has eventually maybe but I see that on a five to ten year time frame not them and I don't think it will happen in the immediate future and and our focus is definitely not in that area at all how much is asked and thought about it as a recreational product not at all it's completely different mindset where we are as a company it'd be very well placed to take advantage of it yeah look I think those that are in the pharmaceutical sector with cannabis would probably be the best place to do it because we already would be producing a very high quality raw material that could then be changed into a different kind of product to make something for the recreational market look it's been interesting that a number of jurisdictions such as Canada Uruguay and states in the u.s. once they have made cannabis available for medical purposes and they've seen that there hasn't resulted in a whole deterioration of society have become a lot more liberal and contemplated or indeed enacted the recreational use so the use for non-medical purposes last month a state parliamentary inquiry told the Victorian Government recreational use of marijuana for adult use is a law reform worthy of exploration do you have a personal view on whether it would be acceptable for recreational cannabis to be allowed in Australia within five or ten years not something that the Commonwealth is proposing but it is a matter for individual states under the Constitution in New Zealand they're also preparing to debate the legalization of recreational cannabis the country's Prime Minister has pledged to hold a referendum before the next election in 2021 what I believe is happening is there's no question in my mind that medical cannabis is the Trojan horse for recreational cannabis and I don't believe it's a bad thing [Music] meanwhile from his north island retreat venture capitalist Ross Smith is about to land his next big deal he's finalizing plans to import cannabis from Queensland and investment-banking colleague asked me the other day on the phone you said Ross you know you're making all this money you know where to next what are going to invest in next I said mate I'm investing in cannabis for the next ten years as long as this the party's only just beginning I mean people got no idea how big this is going to be this is going to be huge [Music] there's lots of talk about the potential riches to be made but for those wading in there are also plenty of risks there's no doubt you know as with any new industry there's a flurry of people jumping on board jumping on the bandwagon and there will be a shakedown as a result of that there is always the early movers there is growth then you have the the late arrivals and then not everyone can we [Music] [Music] [Applause] you"

3nF8AdX9vio,Cancer patient claims her life has been saved by cannabis oil| ITV News,2018-06-14T18:26:02Z,time to celebrate on a day joy Smith never expected to see once told her cancer was terminal now her medical team say she's clear and she says it's thanks to this cannabis oil I went to see my consultant and she said that there was nothing left to say she was quite happy to take me off my treatment I just couldn't believe it when I came how I was just so excited I was just I kept pinching myself all day it was just real I couldn't believe it and I'm still here and I feel really well joy who's from Charles Moore in Coventry underwent extensive chemotherapy and says she can't thank the team at walls grave hospital enough for their care but when all looks bleak a friend suggested she tried cannabis oil at first they wouldn't take it and my daughter kept care if he had your oil mom and I'd pretend I had but I hadn't because I just hated the taste I didn't like the feeling of it it makes you me and a bit like you drunk really but funny I just laughed at everything but I didn't like it there's growing evidence online of the benefits of cannabis oil the issue was brought chomping into focus just yesterday when a mother from Northern Ireland had her supply of oil confiscated at Heathrow Airport she tried to bring it into the UK insisting it's the only solution to help her son who has multiple epileptic fits we've also highlighted the story of Alfie Dingley from Kenilworth who also has a rare form of epilepsy after successful cannabis oil treatment in the Netherlands the Home Office agreed here he could use it on compassionate grounds but many doctors remain skeptical cannabis is an illegal substance generally but when you take out the psychoactive substance the part that gives you a high it may have some medicinal properties so if it is able to be shown to help people safely I think there is a good argument for considering its legal use within the medical profession we spoke to the home office who again reiterated that cannabis is a drug for which there are no known medicinal benefits it's illegal to supply and possess it in the UK and in a statement the charity Cancer Research UK told us we don't advise patients to use can the soil or any alternative therapies to treat cancer or alongside treatment they're having currently there's not enough scientific evidence to say that cannabis oil is a safe or effective treatment in rare cases it's claimed some people systems can produce the same effects as the oil but it can also exacerbate cancers nevertheless Joyce Smith told me she's proof cannabis oil can make a difference and she started a petition to try to make the government legalize it for medical use Wesley Smith ITV News Coventry

IPJyR6UcRIE,Medicinal Cannabis for the Treatment of Chronic Pain - Prof Ian Brighthope - NIIM Seminar June 2018,2018-09-14T05:50:09Z,"[Music] ian is one of Australia's foremost experts in a number of areas but in particular nutritional and environmental medicine as well as herbal medicine he's got qualifications and experience in Orthodox medicine surgery anesthetics agricultural science nutritional environmental medicine and as I said herbal medicine and education so Ian set up the Australasian College of nutritional and environmental medicine over 30 years ago and he has been working in more recent times in the area of medicinal cannabis and he's going to talk to us tonight on the use of medicinal cannabis for the treatment of chronic pain so if you could join me in welcoming in thank you very much Carly and good evening ladies and gentlemen it's a great pleasure to be invited to speak again here we were here not so long ago running a course for doctors of medicinal cannabis which was the first recognized course to be conducted in medicinal cannabis for doctors in Australia which is a breakthrough for neem and Carly was the one who actually organized it all professor O'Brien was the one who organized it all now I'm going to talk about medicinal cannabis and it's a project that I've taken on it's a project that's taking up a lot of my time weekend's evenings and day time as well but it's a very important project from my perspective because always in my life the patient and the public have been that my primary concern as a doctor and and as somebody involved with evolution of of medicines so my first exposure to cannabis I graduated that around about the same time as these guys were seeing and smoking we're not talking about weed marijuana we're talking about another aspect of the plant called cannabis and medicinal cannabis is like any other herb or meadow and it comes from a plant and the ingredients in cannabis are all nutrients we're not talking about drugs when you heat the nutrients in cannabis and smoke the nutrients become water brain soluble and affect the brain and that's when you get your high if that's when you get stoned we're talking here about unheated nutrients from the cannabis plant and I can honestly put my hand on my heart even though in nightly in the 1960s I graduated at university where everybody else was smoking pot I never ever touched it and I haven't ever touched it since but decided to take it back to some mmm reports in the media and this was a 7:30 report not so long ago of a couple of girls who suffered from severe Crohn's disease which is an inflammatory disease of the Bell and degenerative inflammatory disease that can cause severe autoimmune problems elsewhere in the body and also be so severe that can cause death and one of the daughters of this particular gentleman Stephen Taylor was a death almost a death store had lost so much weight had so many complications was on 20 or more different drugs and not getting any better Stephen took it upon himself to stud mmm juicing the cannabis plant and that the juice was made in his own kitchen he grew the plants in his own backyard and this green juice which you can see him making here with one of his daughters that's the juice within a few months had converted a very sick ill dying daughter into a very happy pleasant good-looking beautiful young lady now I've seen the this family I know that this is effective but this is only one family one case of millions around the world who are getting benefit from the medicinal cannabis from the cannabis plant it's also known as the sacred plant and I'd advise anybody here who would like to see a series of videos on YouTube search for the sacred plant make sure it's cannabis because they've been others called the sacred plant make sure it's cannabis and make sure it's that john melon canary and there's a new series coming out as well very worthwhile having a look on your youtube cannabis is an herbal medicine it is a herb it contains nutrients that connect cannabinoids in the plant are nutrients nothing different not a drug they are nutrients please make sure you understand that your doctor understands that and your local politicians also understand it it is a safe effective herbal medicine cannabis has never killed anybody it has very rarely put anybody into hospital it doesn't make anybody sick cannabis could be the next falooda mind if you hear statements like this made by doctors and politicians or anybody for that matter ignore them ignore them completely because they do not know what they're talking about cannabis is non-toxic it's been around in human evolution for the last 10,000 years at least up until the 1937 hmm I add it's an extremely safe herbal medicine it's safer than many of the herbal medicines you find on the shelves in the health food stores it's safer than some John's wort which is used for depression it's a very very in fact is probably a safer herb than tea and coffee that contain caffeine and can cause serious side effects and addiction cannabis does not cause addiction the annual death rates from various substances in in the u.s. 435 from Tibet that 435,000 from tobacco poor diet and exercise alcohol 85,000 marijuana and I'm talking about marijuana we're talking about medicinal cannabis but even marijuana has not caused any document documented notifiable deaths cannabis in Australia is used by over two million Australians recreationally that is a smoked pot every day two million Australians are smoking it between a hundred thousand and one hundred and twenty thousand people use black-market medicinal cannabis it comes from certain parts of Australia where they actually grow it in the black-market medicinal cannabis is available until the late not was available until the 9th late 1930s here in Australia it was used as teachers it was used mainly for migraine pain and spasms and even Queen Victoria used it for her menstrual pain it was taken to into England from India in the 19th century what's the difference between marijuana cannabis and hemp marijuana is the stuff that the Mexicans took into her into the u.s. smoking it and going getting stoned cannabis is the plant species itself or the genus itself and hemp is the part of the cannabis family that's referred to for fiber and food I don't suppose you know that you can make clothing out of hemp you can get food high quality protein from the seed you can make plates that don't break Henry Ford made his first car out of hemp the engine wasn't made out of hemp or steel there are many many myths around surrounding cannabis there is no evidence for its medical or health benefits wrong it increases cancer and heart attacks wrong it's safe to smoke wrong it's safe to inhale but not smoke from an inhaler it's a gateway drug to opiates no wrong it's actually used as an exit drug from the opiates now it's safe in pregnancy we don't know it causes schizophrenia wrong it increases your risk for social anxiety disorder people who use here people who use cannabis are very nice friendly peaceful people they are you never see like I've got a hole at the football match causing riots you never see cannabis at football match causing right so you couldn't just doesn't exist and there is no scientific rationale for its use absolutely incorrect this far more science behind cannabis now than nearly anything else this is it in the field in in China where they grown huge quantities of cannabis and this is a friend of mine in California and he has his own cannabis grow in California and in Oregon as well very nice guy I'll talk about him later these are two nice guys too they're ex-cons from Earth at the States they were drug dealers now they relieve their anxiety with cannabis there are two angels they've exited from criminality and from drug use using counseling and these are only two of hundreds of thousands of people benefiting from this this sacred plant if you like mm-hmm here we have a picture of a leaf and the flower this is where the medicine comes from this is where the nutrients come from and in particular from the flower which is the concentrated part of the cannabinoids the nutrients that are benefit to humankind mm-hmm here is a picture of the trichomes on the surface of the leaf but more frequently higher numbers on the young the flower itself and the bud at the end of the trichome contains all of the cannabinoids and the terpenes and all of the other things that make us feel good and relieve pain and actually make our brain and nervous system and immune system work normally these chemicals these nutrients actually modulate an overactive immune system or nervous system and modulate an underactive nervous system and immune system so it brings things back to normal this is a further close-up off the trichomes and the this is a very very rich flower or bud if you like here's my friend John with a lovely strain of cannabis he actually makes his medicine for his family the cannabinoids are the nutrients that we're talking about like flavonoids terpenoids all of the other points that our founding in nutrients the most common you'll hear about CBD and THC these are the ones that we focus on with regard to pain but we don't ignore all of the other cannabinoids of which there's over 140 there have been many systemic analyses done and this is one published in 2015 by whiting in the Journal of the American Medical Association there was moderate quality evidence to support the use of cannabinoids for the treatment of chronic pain and spasticity don't say there is no evidence that's going back in to 2015 this is 2017 and the American government published the National Academies of Sciences engineering and medicine report on the health effects of cannabis and cannabinoids this is a very large tomb book with references all the way through showing the evidence for its use and its safety its safety and its use there is a lot of evidence now to support the use of this medicine this conclusive and or substantial evidence that plays an important role in treating chronic pain in adults chronic pain in the in body even in animals chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting in cancer patients spasticity symptoms in multiple sclerosis and intractable epilepsy and children for example the dravet syndrome we all hear about that in the media now how important it is for it epileptic kids but anybody with any illness should be offered medicinal cannabis whether it be pain spasm inflammation chronic autoimmune disease cancer anything because it helps the immune system and the nervous system to work normally again what we have in our bodies is a system that most doctors have no idea about I graduated not knowing about the endo cannabinoid system like the circulatory system and the immune system and the nervous and so on and so forth we have an endocannabinoid system a system that makes its own cannabis we make our own cannabis in our nervous system immune system etc we have receptors for these nutrients we should not be denied these nutrients if we are unwell and we know that we will may respond to this as a medicine the various formulations of medicinal cannabis that we use and we're talking tonight about pain chronic pain acute pain it doesn't matter I'll tell you somebody ran into me in the car destroyed my car and created it was very serious back pain and whiplash injury and I went home in pain I went home with this movie going over and over in my head because I could see the car run into the back of me and I couldn't do anything because I was sitting still in a line of traffic and a friend gave me a bottle not this one and I took some of the oil just a few drops of the oil and within half-an-hour I was free of the pain nothing else was working and I also stopped the fear and the thinking and what if what if this what if am I really alive still you know it was a terrible experience and that was only last year that's the way you get you medicinal cannabis you don't smoke it it's an oil in a bottle it's done in now by the way if there's any law reinforcement so that's how you get it you can also get it in tablets and capsules I have seen people inhale you've got chronic obstructive Airways disease who can't breathe who are turning blue or or pink or whatever color they do that depending on whether it's emphysema or bronchitis and within a very short period of time like minutes they get relief from shortness of breath severe shortness of breath you don't want to smoke it I've seen people who've smoked it with obstructive Airways disease and they get relief I don't advocate smoking there are other ways of taking it that are safe and effective there are extracts and crystals and teachers and suppositories and creams and edibles cookies biscuits etc I'm not going to go back into the history when I used to detox patients in hospital and get them off alcohol and pharmaceutical drugs and heroin but I'll go back to 1999 when a friend of mine the late Sir William Keyes developed a mesothelioma and it was operated on and had severe extensive pain and nothing relieving the pain that was when I really witnessed a change because his daughter obtained through contacts in Canberra some cookies cannabis cookies and he took the cookies I witnessed that he took the cookies and got almost instant pain relief but not only pain relief he felt well I feel good you can take all the painkillers in the world and you'll feel oh God maybe get some control of the pain but you don't necessarily feel good not a high but feeling good this is hemp oil you'll see that floating around hemp oil is cannabis oil and it can come in various concentrations and forms this is in a dropper form you can get it also in with syringes and measure out the dose in the syringe for example CBD or THC or a mixture of CBD and THC the best of course is the whole plant medicine with all of the terpenes as well as all of the cannabinoids mm-hmm you want to make sure that it's got all of the ingredients in it and so it's good to ask the manufacturer for a analysis of the of the medicine dosing it's very very simple it's not rocket science dosing is you start low low dose and go slow increase it slowly and you may need to take sometime if it's a complicated situation in terms of determining the dose the right days for the patient and the right medicine the right balance of THC and CBD but that's the skill that the doctor will need to acquire and it's not rocket science it's quite simple you start low and you go slow you may take three weeks to three months to get a response you may get an immediate response we still need a lot of research to be done but we don't want to wait for the research to come in because we know it will work we know it's safe and as long as we have a high quality medicine manufactured under proper standards of GMP you're right to go the side effects very very rare you take too much you might get tired a little bit of dizziness - psychological effects dry mouth changes in memory as I indicated my memory for that acute situation just disappeared it stopped changes in appetite you might get the munchies if you take too much THC get which is good of course if you've got somebody with anorexia nervosa changes the medication requirements may occur intolerance usually develops quite quickly the thing is with medicinal cannabis you can stop it for a while once you get a response have a therapeutic holiday and then go back on to it and that's a good thing to do give you a system arrest from it and that can be done it can be achieved you cannot do that with the opioids if you try and reduce the opioids your pain will come back worse you'll go through withdrawal symptoms and of course you've got a whole lot of other complications with without be on medication nobody has ever died from an overdose of cannabis that is a fact but people die every day from aspirin paracetamol alcohol opiates you name it ice we've got an ice epidemic simply because we have got gone against the use of cannabis as a medication that does have some interactions with medications all you need is a chart or the doctor needs a chart to go through and find out what medications you're on but hopefully you'll be able to withdraw from some of your medications especially the antidepressants tranquilizers and opiate drugs once you've gone on to some medicinal cannabis I give you examples of severe chronic back pain follow injuries Parkinson's disease I've seen improvements in patients with Parkinsons severe bone pain from medicated aesthetic carcinoma of the breast autism PTSD and of course clinical detoxification I showed these two guys before they only representative of millions of patients in the world who are taking cannabis for various problems and avoiding the use of pharmaceutical drugs and alcohol and and other harder drugs there's a way of diagnosing the right foster regulations training of doctors is important education of the public is important that's what we're doing here education of politicians bureaucrats and public servants is also very important for us to get access to it it's an extremely safe herbal medicine as I mentioned his global education education of GPS here has started to occur already and come back to celebrities mention these guys before John Easterling is married to one of our celebrities he's making his medicine for his family and his family is Australia's favorite so we've worked very closely with Olivia and Amazon John to try and get better access for cannabis here in Australia for patients I think the American Medical Association back in 1937 begged the US government to not ban hemp and cannabis the the president of the American Medical Association at the time pleaded because in the materia medica in the u.s. up until 1937 there were two formulations of medicinal cannabis which were available here on prescription as well they're available to my parents my grandparents why did they make it illegal because in the materia medica in the u.s. it was available for over 100 indications question why can't we go across the road and buy some medicinal cannabis we have every right to that medicine it's safe effective and will not kill not harm or put people in hospital thank you [Applause] [Music]"
SXwWzaQ9Aiw,Billy Caldwell&#39;s mother: ‘Medical cannabis keeps my epileptic son alive’,2018-07-05T14:04:11Z,I knew the consequences when his medicine was confiscated to watch it has to be the most horrific thing that a mother has to watch belly has a very severe form of epilepsy he has a life-threatening form of epilepsy is one seizure can can kill him Bali's antiepileptic medication was stopped abruptly when it was confiscated at London Heathrow Airport and at 1:00 a.m. on the Tuesday morning Bali had a seizure Tuesday here - Wednesday had three Thursday 3:00 and then Freddie Moore and he woke up on a seizure and they were going back-to-back they break your child's body the breccia child's mind and slowly slowly you just watch your change slipping away from you over the weekend I assured an emergency license to allow Billy cold Wells medical team to access cannabis based medicine to treat life-threatening seizures caused by a severe form of epilepsy he got his first dose on Saturday by Monday he was starting to perk up and you could see him which was just truly a me isn't he's just full of love laughter he likes women he likes horse riding anything that's puns but this was never just about belly for me I would in no way ever declare that medicinal cannabis is a cure but what I would say is it is definitely a medicine that children like Billy should be given a chance to try there is a pressing need to allow those who might benefit from cannabis based products to access them [Music]
OSldNOsh0Ug,Medicinal Cannabis: Table Talk,2018-02-05T23:00:01Z,[Music] would you give your child illicit drugs if you thought it was going to help them new research has come out saying that medicinal cannabis can actually help with epilepsy and different types of epilepsy now in Australia it's not it's not easy to get hold of it's known I guess as a recreational drug but West working towards getting it available to some of the families some of the people that need it would you give your child this sort of thing if they needed it even though it's not sort of through the system yet through the TGA I don't actually know because like I did a little bit of research about it I said I'm trying to figure out why is it so bad other than the fact that the government has said no but the fact is because medicinal cannabis like the plant itself has got so many raw chemicals it's really hard for them to pinpoint what is helpful and what isn't so when you give it to them as medicinal there may be actually bad side effects as well the study the studies pretty good like it's that side come through but it was only on 100 people and it's that's not huge at all so there's risk also in giving them you know normal diagnosan antibiotics someone and whatnot so I think with I would I would if it was hoping my child I definitely would how severe do you feel like the sickness or illness needed to be for you to feel like that was a good solution if that was the last resort I wouldn't be like okay you have got epilepsy that's it we're giving you some marijuana at MIT medicinal marijuana oh if that was the last resort I'd probably yeah would try that because I wouldn't want my child to function and you know some of these I'm what not these epilepsy is quite severe and even fatal for some people so they're really trying to push it for this group of people to sort of get it through and cultivate it in Australia and sort of regulate our own industry I'm just really concerned though because yeah short term like when you give it to them it it will help and you recognize that a house but what is gonna happen in a long-term there hasn't been any long-term studies that that's why they're doing I guess all these tests you know you've got parents who are really frustrated with the government for not pushing this through because it has shown to be helpful but on the other hand they are they are liable for anything that may go wrong in the future as you say and they need to sort of regulate this themselves and do that testing to make sure that it's as safe as it can be I might be going off on a tangent but I do think I'm a bit nice when I say that I feel like the government tries to prohibit certain substances for power and control yes and no but they're also accountable aren't they so if something starts to go wrong who's everyone gonna blame but there's money to be made as well on both sides for penalizing people for taking marijuana or for medicinal purposes there's money to be made so the government can control that I kind of see where you're coming from but I don't know I kind of I guess because I went through that hole when I was in sixth grade drug abuse resistance education it's very hard then to turn your brain the other way and think about some of these substances in another way but a lot of the medicines we use now were previously or if they're if they're used or if they're abused they are harmful as well so yeah morphine and opium yes that's all done but the problem the problem I have is not that it's just that there is just isn't enough research done on marijuana at the moment and that it's fraught with danger because there is just yeah that's the science behind it and trying to get the medicine out of it it's do a bit dicey it's all it's also dicey because people are starting to try and source their own here so it's not actually being regulated and that can be an issue too yeah I would be just I think some people are very fine with you know giving medicine at home to their children are coming up with some concoction or going in the backyard and pulling a weed but I think I'm a bit on the other side of you know more traditional and wanting to see the studies or I trust more medical professionals and maybe some people who don't trust medical professionals or you know I thought you would be the natural so you wouldn't give it to Elliott if it was the last resort you would you know just but where would you get it from would you go to the street corner and find it to give it to your child there are some GPS who are registered to be able to administer it not many because they have to apply for that registration so that it's not just your average GP might be on the corner I'm not saying that I wouldn't because you know when it happens like who knows what I would do yeah but there is just a caution about the fact that what you think might help you me out actually yeah and until you know the facts you don't want to put I'd be too scared because then I'd have to bring that up to my medical professional and say when they ask okay what have you done at home or have you done anything I'd have to tell them and I don't know how that might interact with something else that they're using you know I don't know how all the drugs interact with one another I wouldn't feel skilled enough to administer marijuana in my home to my child yeah I don't know that I would be in the same same line as I wouldn't feel skilled enough to do it I'd be scared but you know when you're kids in a situation where they're so desperate and you you need something not just to help them feel better each day but to literally survive how far would you go I think I would if I could find a way to do it I wouldn't if that's what it involved I'd probably have a crack at it but you never know until you're in that situation I'd consult with other parents who have done the same thing I wouldn't just go to the street corner [Laughter] seriously I would consult first obviously and maybe I think with what you're saying there probably are countries where they are administering it I'd probably be more likely to take my kid on a plane to some other place where it's actually being administered and be under the care of a doctor yeah but that's probably that's desperate obviously like you said it's life you know and I do recognize the fact that parents will go to any lady like today definitely definitely would anyone be concerned that if they did it could sort of lead to addiction later in life for their child yet for their child they actually filter out they filter out different stuff so yeah it's it's different the thing that they're frightened is that you know you're growing that for medicinal purposes but then it could then what you grow could be used for for the California I think it's legal and it seems to be doing well over there for a lot of people who would be doing well for people but I don't see why it's being so prohibited over here if it's doing again I go back to government regulation money power control they're saying that they don't have enough studies behind it to sort of go down that road just yet but they're at least looking into it they're at least going down that road and not ignoring it completely you
d27ZEUwoOzE,Security a requirement for Sunshine Coast medicinal cannabis plant,2018-01-08T12:09:51Z,part of our licensing conditions which we've all been approved for means that we have to ensure our product is not diverted so we will cultivate we will produce manufacture medicinal cannabis oil that then gets distributed through pharmacies 90% of what we're producing here does not have a psychoactive ingredient we are talking about a medicine the important difference is the genetic profile we have exclusive plants developed over decades which if you can imagine one plant gets grown properly according to good agricultural practice extracted and then convert it become a medicine for an epileptic child a different plant has a different genetic profile and that would be produced for pain management or multiple sclerosis or people with cancer so really the security measures which are very important allow us to get on with the business of producing medicine for Australian patients you can see the security compound here you can see the the camera poles that are coming in and in the razor wire and we're also obviously in a in a fairly naturally secured area although we seem like we're in the middle of nowhere we're very close to hospitals and health precincts here on the Sunshine Coast as well as that we have 24 hours security on-site all of our systems go through what is called biometric finger scanning whilst we're near completion in the greenhouse I guess as some people might want to see what's in there most people want to see what's in there there's a lot of commercial in quite confidence information as well as because we've partnered with the global pioneers we're not guessing our way through this sure we are learning but we have a template and I guess if you can imagine if other companies and interested parties were to see how that was set up that would affect the commercial capacity and the competitiveness so it's important that we're just allowed to get on with the business of producing medicine so we're in a manufacturing side of things so because we produce oils here and we have a bottling plant automated bottling plant so we can adequately provide for patients for you this is where the security products get stored in the vaults so on one side we have all product which is once it's harvested cultivate a house with an S Drive and goes there and it's into a secure compound that's way too much more than other than it's a very heavy steel safe door and in is where all the raw material phase and then when it's needed for extraction purposes goes through to the laboratory becomes oil it's tested and then all we finish the product goes off into the second mold the doctors are the gatekeepers all of us have a doctor we're familiar with getting prescriptions there is a template and a distribution channel that we already know and it already works well in Australia in Queensland you can visit a GP or a specialist and they can be given approval they can get an approval from the health department as well as the federal TGA we'll approve them and they can then prescribe you a schedule 8 medicine and for anyone out there who knows medicine that is a highly controlled substance that is dispensed through pharmacies and already has a secure a distribution network as a private company the three other companies that are in the same licence category as us they're public so of course they beholden to shareholders and good luck to them but we believe it's vital to deliver affordable medicine to Australian patients this is the first year so we just want to get it right at home first we came to market with a local production facility to serve the Australian patient so you know it's all well and good and it is great to think there's a big export market out there but in our view it's vital to help Australian patients first we see this industry which will probably be easily seventy billion dollars worth globally by 2025 we want to see Australia on the front foot leading the charge and that's why we're delighted that we have companies like Medi farm adopting the compliance necessary and working with world-class intellectual property because Australia will lead the pack on this and the better our domestic industry the better our exports the better our exports the more jobs and the healthier Australians will be

WGg5lZYA-Mc,"Talking Point: Medicinal cannabis, Hype or Highpe? - David Taylor",2018-04-24T11:23:04Z,[Music] I've been told not to move around too much which you can judge from my shape I don't move that much anyway the the cannabis is the use of medicinal cannabis has been known for thousands of years there's records in Chinese history of the use of cannabinoids but and it's been used in addition to being used medicinally it's also been used for other purposes rope canvas seeds food what sort of being an important part of the Western use of cannabis was the work of Oceania see back in 1840 he was a British physician who was working in India and wrote a number of publications on the medicinal use of cannabis in about the 1850s his then started to appear in the pharmacopoeias and was present in those pharmacopoeias up until in the mid 1920s from about 1915 to 1937 there was increasing restrictions particularly from America and this was the marijuana Tax Act and in fact it was a way of introducing prohibition and it was really the start of the international narcotics restriction on cannabis so cannabis was being classified as a narcotic inappropriately but that's the way it was and therefore from then it became illegal and so recently though cannabis has become available and and legalized a number of states in America and I have colleagues who you have been involved in the cannabis injuries industry in a number of states so I'm going to show you some pictures of the various facilities and that so all of the cannabis plant plants that are grown are identifiable they're tracked by barcodes and this is in their vegetative state and plants can get to a flowering State in controlled conditions the way of planting I should backtrack the way in which you can undertake growing of cannabis is open field glass houses and indoor grows the advantage of the indoor grows is that you have concurrent sorry can control the conditions such as lighting water nutrients air quality temperature all of those things impact on the yield so if you're going to produce a product with good manufacturing practice in mind you need to have some way of control in that so a lot of works been done on indoor grows and it's not just the sort of hydroponics that you read about in the papers so these are all female plants they are cloned in that they are taken from mother plants so that these producers know the lineage of the plants that they're growing so from that they are potted out no pun intended into these larger pots into these grow rooms of thousands of feet in area and over a eight to 12 weeks depending on which particular species they're growing they will allow them to grow and for those that are close enough you can see they've got plenty of flowering tops here and then they're getting progressively taller and very trimmed so the plants are trimmed and kept on these mobile trolleys the lighting conditions are altered because you can actually stimulate the different stages by changing the light and the lights generate a large amount of heat so in fact most of the air conditioning is to cool the heating cool the the lighting so that you maintain usually around the sort of 24 mark in America they 74 degrees these plants are then harvested and various stages are cut and so these are the flowering tops that are trimmed and these can be trimmed manually or they can be trimmed in machines that will actually take off the the excess all of the plant material is actually used for extraction there is no waste people don't sit outside these factories and collect the green waste as a community service or anything and so this is the trimming of the flowers and then the buds those buds are cut up into smaller sizes put into these boxes and then they will dehumidifies over a few weeks so from original cutting the cloning through to actually putting them through the drying procedure is of the order of 16 to 20 weeks so people can run four crops a year indoors outdoors you can't do that sort of throughput nor do you have the same control so then you end up depending on what state you're in an America and this one here is the Venice Beach in California and Los Angeles and this is a dispensary in Nevada in them and they have different condition or different conditions on being a registered medicinal cannabis user in America or in California $40.00 enables you to actually become classified as a cannabis user in Nevada you can register through your doctor and the annual fee there is three hundred and forty dollars so there's a difference in the different states whilst Nevada and California are next to one another you can't export from one state to the other so there's no there are considerable federal restrictions on movement of cannabis which is interesting when you consider that in Australia we're actually importing cannabis not from America or in some cases we are but predominantly from Canada or Israel or Europe so we don't have the same border restrictions than they do in the United States so this is a and I'll show you some more pictures here in a moment up on the board this is a new dispensary this actual dispensary belongs to that row of the that produces so this company is completely vertically integrated they have from plant through to product and up here they have what the different our preparations are banks can't deal in America with cannabis producers at the moment federal law restricts them or prevents them from doing so so it's a cash environment I went to one cannabis show and it's the first well I wouldn't call it a psychic convention but the first convention I've ever been to where part of the display was there were two aspects interest me one were the vaults in which you keep the cannabis preparation and the other with the availability of cash counting machines they actually had machines because of the amount of cash to get around it Oh around the in this door here to actually have an ATM so you can get your money out of the ATM come round all of these display cabinets you can't touch the cannabis but you can smell it there's all of these have got means of the display cabinets of God you can pick up the thing and actually smell it but you can't touch the cannabis this one has also books on the specifications of a particular product so that's what's happening now but before that where's this cannabis coming from now all of these are botanically derived products the other thing that is confusing the issue is people talk about synthetic cannabinoids synthetic cannabis analogues and the endocannabinoids the synthetic cannabinoids are the compounds that are found in the cannabis plant which have been synthesized now the final structure of THC the major psychoactive constituent of cannabis wasn't actually determined until 1964 in 1967 they produce a synthetic pathway and since then synthetic THC has been available for research purposes from the and in fact that's funded by the National Institute of drug abuse the synthetic cannabis analogues are other small molecules that have been designed to act on the cannabis receptor and they have cannabinoid activity unfortunately they also often have other activities and those other activities is what's responsible for the psychosis and the toxicity around synthetic cannabis so when people talk of synthetic cannabis the canine the spice those sorts of things they're talking about these analogs they're not talking about the synthetic cannabinoids that are the cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant the endocannabinoids are those cannabinoids that are found within the central nervous system and the periphery that are endogenous to act on the cannabinoid system and they're thought to be a potential target so bit of structure th C's the major psychoactive constituent cannabidiol cannabinoid and terpenes are also very important there's over a hundred cannabinoids a few years ago people used to say 60 now people identify more and more cannabinoids or unique compounds found in the cannabis plant so what do they do sorry whoops okay I've mentioned about the synthesis all rights as a pharmacologist also mentioned it was just nonspecific THC itself is very lipophilic it doesn't it's very hard to get into solution you've got a play pharmaceutical tricks with it but it's basically an oil at room temperature it's an oil so when and so it was very difficult to actually work with because there was no way it was wasn't acting on a receptor but in the early 90s the receptor was cloned without actually knowing what the receptor was it was then identified as being the cb1 receptor in the brain and predominantly this in the periphery was the CB 2 but there are CB 1 in the periphery as well there the major and then the big things were the increase more than half the states in the US and Australia in seventeen now have got it so if you just simply Google pub do a PubMed search number of medicinal cannabis publications over the decades so back here when I started I could do the literature literature review and all of them dissing or cannabis by just reading five papers over five years so it was you know very small literature survey now we've got over 1400 between 2011 and 15 and that's even greater already since 2016 the last two years it's just skyrocketing so and I mentioned that here's the this is the THC unique thing about THC and alcohol is neither of them have a nitrogen whereas the endogenous cannabinoids one of them does an and amide is one of the endogenous major endogenous cannabinoids and two AG is the other they have slightly different selectivities and and amide is more potent on CB 1 the brain and that was where it was first identified to AG has equal potency here is the obligatory receptor this is a presynaptic neurone doesn't matter what it is I've done a lot of work over the years and every neurone system I looked at you could find presynaptic and cannabinoid activity but this could be dopamine it could be 5-ht for instance and then there is a post synaptic membrane activation of this neuron axon this receptor this postsynaptic membrane to produce an effect doesn't matter what it is for the sake of this that or some other mechanism can trigger the synthesis of an and amide or to a G so the endogenous cannabinoids and not stored they're released in response to some action they then act presynaptic lee and in the brain particularly on the cb1 receptor to alter that transmission so it's a sort of feedback mechanism so if you were going to influence the endocannabinoid system the targets are the synthesis or the inactivation so don't come back to that in a moment so what does cannabis do it has both physical and psychological effects dealing with the psychological first the psychological are very variable they the euphoria that people go after this is predominantly THC effects so cb1 activation you forea drowsiness altered time sense hearing less discriminant visual distortions fixed on concentration dreamlike state and in some individuals particularly sensitive or susceptible a paranoia physically an increase in heart rate that's a consistent effect very little effect on blood pressure dose dependent and maybe an orthostatic hypotension conjunctival reddening decrease in muscle strength decrease in body temperature intraocular pressure and an increase in appetite the munchies so there and I've put that under there as a as a physical effect although there is a considerable psychological component so what are the uses of cannabis now there's a lot of hype around cannabis doing everything you name a disease cannabis will actually cure it it's the only thing that's missing off this slide is world peace so there's a reason for the different colors which I hope will become obvious but this is of a leaf lie website which actually is a an American based and it if you go into the leaf lie website which is a credit I'm not breaching copyright there was an acknowledgment here at the bottom except it's only 50% of the acknowledgment but if you go into glee fly it actually tells you about I think when I looked at it yesterday there were two thousand four hundred and seventy one different strains or different entries of cannabis so you could then go into each of those and identify what that particular strain was reportedly good to treat and it also told you where you could obtain it now being investigative I decided to type in Richmond to see if there was anywhere close by and I typed in Richmond and it came up with Richmond Virginia bit too far to travel but you can actually see the dispensaries in Virginia that sell these products which ones they sell so there's a whole lot for those at the front they can see this is all of the different diseases that cannabis can treat so it got appetite loss anorexia I really like the fact they've got the two of the same thing mixed together so hexia pretty good gastrointestinal disorders nausea diabetes Crohn's anxiety ADHD stress bipolar OCD PDS D depression then we get down to the epilepsies what I find interesting and a neurological we've got osteoporosis so I'm not quite sure how that fits in other than the fact that a central nervous system disease is contained within a bone structure and then we've got these others around here this is my long-winded way of saying what doesn't treat so what's added and I again I apologize here we've got that went too far didn't this is all of the some of the cannabinoids there's only three of them listed cannabidiol THC and a couple of the acids and cannabinoid is mentioned as a that are associated with the treatment according to this site so this is the source of information that's available when people make a choice about which drug they are going to go into a dispensary and requests because their doctor only has to certify they may benefit from it a similar thing applies here but it's a little bit more restrictive because we actually don't have the entrepreneurial people who want to actually provide as much choice and the reason for the colors is these there's two major strains there's cannabis indica and Cannabis sativa or a hybrid and people seem to think this makes a difference so they then color it like this I think it's colorful how useful is I'm not quite sure because the I have an interest in what's actually being people are used in cannabis for there was a study done in British Columbia that by a group where there's being compassionate access and this was about the time I heard about 900 people that who were clients of this Vancouver compassion Society and they asked him the reason why they were using medicinal cannabis and what they found it beneficial for and they HIPAA pain hepatitis C I don't know of any antiviral effect but there is some in large concentrations anxiety hiv/aids particularly the appetite stimulating effect cancer depression the Lambert initiative which is based at the University of Sydney and the Lambert initiative is as a consequence of the generosity of Barry Lambert whose granddaughter suffers from uncontrolled seizures and he gave 23 million dollars to the University of Sydney and that was in addition to nine million dollars that the previous Premier of New South Wales Baird also gave to the Lambert so the University of Sydney are very cash rich to undertake so one of the first things they did was actually look surveyed people who were cannabis users what they were taking it for pain 33% so that's a common feature anxiety depression sleep disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder so that was what people said they were taking what I find interesting is a lot of the work that's been done is in untracked aural untreatable childhood epilepsy no one was take no one indicated in either of those studies that's what they were using it for so that's a the other thing that I think is interesting is that we actually don't know what is the are these actives alone the important thing or is it a mixture and in particular people are trying to work out their identifying terpenes so they add the aroma and so when people smell that product in the dispensary because they're the clients who are self administering these agents they actually smell it to assess whether that will be useful to them and so what people are now looking at is what's the importance of the combination of what's in the botanical extract and that's the entourage effect so some sort of synergistic interaction between the various components so what are those components the two major ones that we hear about THC and CBD I've used a very reliable source of information again Leafly so this is the range when I started working on cannabis now over 40 years ago the amount of THC in the cannabis preparation was one or two percent and I remember mid 80s people started talking about this product that came out of Hawaii which was 15% and so it got the name Maui Wowi is actually whilst it's available not available it's referred to in Leafly they don't have the concentration but Maui Wowi is now generally accepted to being it's a very high THC so it's around 20-25 percent THC but as you can see all of these granddaddy purple grape ape LA Confidential they're all twenty plus percent THC this is ten times the concentration that was available in the mid-70s so this is how the selection and the breeding that people have gone to to actually develop these strains and as I said if you go to leaf life reliable there's over 2000 references now to different strains the other one is CBD and all of these have very low percentages so these are targeting THC these are drug effect this is not a medicinal effect in my mind Charlotte's Web has got the reverse it's got a very high CBD concentration and Charlotte's Web it's um Charlotte's Web is the was grown I think it was Oregon it was in the States for the treatment of a child with that intractable epilepsy and her name was Charlotte and it was effective and that's how that got its name so the high CBD has been known for some time to have or reportedly have and any convulsant activity so the routes of administration recreationally is usually smoked or taken orally as regards the medicinal cannabis you can't actually prescribe and Justin or cannabis if it's going to be smoked it's not it's um being banned so all of the products that are available here are either oils or and administered by drop this as far as the Australian manufacturers go or they are our capsules so we've got the oils capsules and there's edibles and I'll show you some more oral mucosal Sativex is the GW Pharmaceuticals GW Pharmaceuticals is the largest pharmaceutical company manufacturing cannabinoids and it's got a significant presence it's in a UK company listed originally on the London Stock Exchange it then did went got dual listing with the New York Stock Exchange and then delisted from the New York from the London Stock Exchange and now has a market cap of just under three billion u.s. so there's a lot of money going into this product and sativex is the one that's used to treat multiple sclerosis muscle spasm there's not one country who have done the evaluation see whether it's on to go on to the equivalent of our PBS where in fact the numbers stack up benefit does not account for the cost so from a cost-benefit analysis it doesn't work so this surah mucosal it's a spray I'll show in elation vapor and smoked and then topical gel there's a trial that's just concluding in Melbourne using them a gel and so this is just an example we've got edibles this is a volcano device that the plant material is placed in here heats to a particular temperature and then the product goes into effect early what is the plastic bags like it's cylinder on the top and then people breathe the contents of that bag and this is SATA oops this is the Sativex this is the set of X that has it's a horrible causal spray so you just pray spray it under the tongue and it's a equal combination of THC and CBD and that's the glicks that's the GW product the pharmacokinetics following inhalation because it's very lipid folic philic it crosses the membranes very quickly and so it's actually got a profile that's very similar to intravenous if you accept the absorption phase but then there's a very rapid decline the eleven hydroxy mentor is a metabolite slightly slight level but that persists that's an active metabolite and then you've got an inactive carboxylic acid which persists for hours what's interesting is that the THC effects last can Sidra bleah longer than the peak of the THC so when people are talking about doing analysis of blood levels against defects except for the initial high there's no correlation so unlike blood alcohol levels there's no level there's no correlation between the THC level and the degree of impairment this is the blood level now if you're going to do maybe brain levels that might have an effect but to do that roadside for instance that's a little more restrictive so these are some of those synthetic cannabinoids that some of these are experimental and some have found them their way into being incorporated in synthetic cannabis products and I'll just move along the potential uses people wanted synthesize the product and and have so the agonist we could use the other one was the antagonist and as I said as a pharmacologist when the antagonist became available this was very exciting because enabled you this was a pharmacological tool you could use to manipulate both exogenous cannabinoids but also endogenous cannabinoids and Ramana band was a found too well is the best-known of the cb1 antagonists it was particularly good in preclinical observations or in clinical observations rather to reduce smoking and in fact there was studies done in Melbourne using Ramana band as a for smoking cessation and it was actually found to be very good and so it was potentially thought well here we are might be goodness smoking cessation decrease that appetite stimulating effect so therefore as an anorexic and decrease psychosis so antipsychotic it was approved about 2005 a couple of years later though it was noticed that it in fact it induced anxiety and suicidal ideation and so it was withdrawn from the market and has never been seen again since and that's possibly because the endogenous cannabinoids system is throughout the brain and it actually is involved very much in reward pathways so if you actually block that system you're not just targeting the ones which control appetite but you're blocking them throughout and therefore it actually decreases your the pleasure of life so it's a that's stopped progression the other one that you might have read about was a far inhibitor now far is responsible for the breakdown of an and amide it's a fatty acid fatty acid I made hydrolyze and by reducing or inhibiting far you get an and amide levels going up activation of the endogenous system and therefore it would be beneficial and produce the AZ the appetite stimulant for whatever you wanted to analgesic activity and in this particular case this was a what I would regard as a very badly done study in France Phase one site where one of the patients died and one of the participants died and another one is severely brain injured out of six people who participated so far this particular compound the BIA compound this was not due to fire inhibition but was due to another action of this enzyme inhibitor but it muddies the water when people actually look at the dangers are so so the perceived dangers associated with cannabis um I'll come back to that so actually now it's just so this this is from this is the one of the dispensaries in Vegas and these are the edibles for those of you that are vegan we have vegan cookies with a hundred and two milligrams of THC and it's got we've got peanut butter cookies and so these range and around the sort of ten dollars a biscuit or a cookie and they have around somewhere between thirty and fifty milligrams of THC now that is a reasonably good dose of THC if you compared that to the Sativex one spray of the Sativex is twenty-eight milligrams and that's the oral mucosal so this is not bad and here we've got mile-high mints the peanut Budda Budda and the boulder bar down here we've got chocolate slices with this is bad eyesight this is um ten milligram 20 milligram and 30 milligram that's stamped into the chocolate so you can get your own dose by I'll have two of the large ones I know actually only I'll have a white chocolate today thank you so if someone gives you Easter bunnies I'd like to go back this week and see what's in Vegas this week and what they are but so access D medicinal cannabis there are two parties involved this is the federal government and the state government this is the state government website and it's got a lot of information and essentially this is from I found this probably the most useful because I'm a very visual person what a patient would be doing has the discussion with the doctor the doctor applies now in my day job I'd involved in rain the ethics office and stopping people from doing research my desk is nowhere near as clear as this and so there's approving authorities for that that's the TGA and then approval is granted if that's relevant and I'll tell you why that's relevant in a moment and then the doctor prescribes the medicinal cannabis what I find odd about this is that the doctors don't necessarily prescribe a dose they may say that people will benefit from the drug the same as in the states they may prescribe an oil but then how many drops you give is the decision of the patient so a lot of doctors so the uptake have been an approved doctor so to do this you can be a you can apply under a special access scheme or you can be approved and approved prescriber to be an approved prescriber you need to have expertise in the disease you're treating and so once you're an approved prescriber you can then you don't need to get further approval from the TGA and to get approval doctors can apply to an H rec because we can be we can approve certain drug uses or a device usage following a particular approval process so that's the one it's a little thing so this is the back to there now the one it just very quickly this is um that was in October this is the most recent GW website and they're talking about this use of this is a developmental pipeline and they've got this CP CP CBD V for the epilepsy they've just released some preliminary results on that and in fact they got a 40% reduction in seizures it's complicated a little bit though because they've got 40 percent reduction in placebo group as well so the responses and this is a coat occurs with a lot of the cannabis responses is it's very susceptible to biological variability it's to me it's like the sort of the equivalent of antidepressant treatment no antidepressant is successful in a hundred percent if not know any depressant successful in 50 percent of people this is similar so it's now trying to work out why they got such a good Percy beau response because it will save a lot on the power in growing the stuff and so they've got some others going and that was it so any questions
CLhoVEIXn6A,Blue Aro News: Queensland Australia - Reforms Their Medical Cannabis bill,2018-12-06T22:57:32Z,hey there this is ginger miller at blue arrow news continuing international cannabis coverage headed over to Australia this is December 6 2018 and yesterday Queensland Parliament held a public briefing for the health and other legislation amendment bill which they're hoping to pass this bill will repeal the previous cannabis act in favor of opening up medical cannabis to more patients currently it allows a limited list of particular patients those experiencing nausea from chemotherapy those with multiple sclerosis epilepsy or chronic pain and this bill is hoping to allow specialist practitioners to be able to prescribe this much-needed medicine to any and all patients who could benefit from it as we know in the u.s. it takes local movements to create widespread change on a national level perhaps this is what will allow medical cannabis to be opened up for more patients thanks for joining this is ginger Miller at blue arrow news powered by you the people
JCjilAp7mfY,CA Clinics | Administration Medicinal Cannabis,2018-11-29T06:48:32Z,the route by which the drug is administered has important implications for its bioavailability and therapeutic effect cannabis is quite unique in that it can be administered through a number of means it can be smoked vaporized eaten or me cozily or topically administered smoking which results in the fast onset but short duration of action is most common with recreational users and this is not a bias since it produces toxic byproducts that can irritate the lungs a vaporization has a similar onset and duration of action however since no burning is involved it produces less irritants most of them distal cannabis preparations in Australia and New Zealand come in the form of oil and capsules that could be orally ingested or administered to the gums the cheek or the floor of the mat when a drug is swallowed it gets degraded by the stomach and goes through significant first-pass metabolism meaning that a portion of it is broken down where the liver or because little administration intends to avoid some of this metabolism however some of the drug usually ends up getting swallowed these routes of administration exhibits slower onset with longer durations of action and are amenable to self titration which is important for patients to find a suitable dose topical administration is also a viable option where applicable as first pass metabolism is not an issue
vnWQw-RdGbA,Medicinal Cannabis as a solution to the ageing and palliative care crisis,2018-02-08T22:36:51Z,"our next presenter is Professor Simon Ackerman presenting on medicinal cannabis as a solution to the aging and palliative care crisis Simon Ackerman is a senior professor of health economics at the Australian Health Services Research Institute and University of Wollongong his research institute interests alongside optimizing medical cannabis policies include robust methods for cost-effectiveness evidence synthesis and translation multiple strategy and efficiency comparisons allowing allowing for quality care consistent with maximizing net benefit multiplier methods in health promotion settings multiple domain comparisons in palliative care settings and value of information methods collectively the principles and research methods he has developed enable optimally informing joint research reimbursement implementation and pricing decisions his related policy original methodological and applied research published in the highest impact international health economics social science medical decision-making and policy journals and recently collated in the spring of published health economics and theory to practice from theory to practice so please welcome professor Simon ecumene [Applause] today's talk I'm going to focus on some of those methods but most importantly I'm going to focus on the social context in which medicinal cannabis can potentially make its impact and particularly the opportunity provided by the baby boomer aging process and you'll see initially in my talk how that leads to a big challenge and indeed a challenge where we need to be reforming parts of the age in health care system and then I really want to focus after that on the role that medicinal cannabis can play within that and most importantly how we should be optimizing the use of medicinal cannabis in terms of the policies to get the best net benefit maximize the net benefit of medicinal cannabis and maximize that role in terms of successful aging so what is successful aging Alexandre Kalash who's the sort of world bureau on Aging who worked for many years with the World Health Organization but now leads and is the president of the International longevity Centre in Brazil and globally highlights that baby boomers the generation born between 1946 and 1964 who redefined the the notion of adolescence in the 1960s who want an increasingly demand what he turns a gentle essence a lovely term for the notion of of successful aging where you're physically mentally and socially active what he also really points to is the need to have community-based approaches to do that and indeed in terms of palliative care have processes successful death as well as successful age aging what it really highlights as a culture is that we fail in that objective currently because we tend to put all our stock in that last pillar of what he sees as the four pillars required for successful aging so he talks about health capital education capital and most importantly social capital community friends family etc and then finally financial capital and/or resilience and unfortunately in our culture we tend to pull all our stock in that last one and in reality we need to be if we're going to be successful aging and particularly with a baby boomers remaining physically mentally socially active and indeed having fun which is the notion of two rental essence it's your adolescence in all age will need to be investing in all those other forms of capital well that's going backwards so in Australia if we look at the ABS website where they have the projections of aged population of the aging of the population and indeed the projections of the whole population which I might get the people are back there to click on that for me I think I think they were going to click on that what we have currently is about 14% of the population okay so if you've got the ABS population there currently and I like to refer to the baby boomer population which is the section in in the middle layer from currently ages 53 to 71 as the love handles of the age sex profile so you can see both males and females they're a very large cohort within that population now that's 2016 and if we go forward to go forward to 2045 with the arrow at the bottom you see what's going to happen by 2045 we're going to triple the number of people over the age of 85 and more generally those who are currently turning 65 are going to live for more than 20 years and as a result we're going to get 3 times as many people over 85 three times as many people with dementia and eventually you'll also see much higher rates of people dying in other words palliative services required go back to the normal slide now so we've got a situation where we're going to face the challenge and the challenge of successfully aging from really now until 2045 indeed it was really from 2011 when the first of them turn 65 now in terms of what the impact of that is well this doesn't seem to be working anymore so historically we haven't really experienced the effects of aging in terms of health expenditure and that's because while the population is aged we've had huge reductions in mortality rates or increases in life expectancy and the numbers there are quite startling between 1970 and 2002 in all male and female populations between the age of 44 and 77 the mortality rates more than halved and that's been pretty protective of our health expenditure because a lot of the costs associated particularly in old age but with with health costs generally associated with proximity to death and the aging cost that we talk about a very large proportion of them associated with proximity to death so the fact we've had reduction in mortality rates means you've got less people dying left costs associated with people dying when the Productivity Commission in 2006 did some analysis they showed that far from aging having been a major contributor to increase in health expenditure actually only about 0.18 percent of health expenditure growth is explained by aging when you allow for this proximity to death or decline in age specific mortality rates decreasing the current mortality and postponing cost to older age importantly what that means is only about a twentieth of the growth and health expenditure up until now has been explained by aging and it's because you've had this protective effect of increasing life expectancy however what's going to happen in the future essentially that's because mortalities being delayed but it's not going to be delayed forever so from 2015 2045 the absolute rate of mortality will increase by 50% and that's basically cuz the baby boomers are dying the over 85 age groups have not have not had reductions in mortality rates and they when they get into their 80s 90s etc that in turn leads to an increase in health expenditure from 812 percent of GDP by 2045 and half of that as being a tribute of aging importantly when you're looking at how do we actually successfully age how do we overcome this challenge all that's modeled on and predicated on the basis that you have continual high costs associated with death and that you've got continual new technology costs in other words the type of things which would be incurring in the last 30 and 40 years so if you want a successfully aged then we need to be addressing how to have lower cost of death lower costs of palliative care processes and lower costs associated with new technology in general the new technology issue is we need to be better using existing technologies now medicinal cannabis happens to be quite an old technology it's been around for more than 5,000 years so we know that we can indeed produce medicinal cannabis and I'm going to show you in this talk at a very low cost indeed that actually be very effective it also has some properties which allow you to better address palliative patient needs so in this slide I'm showing you that palliative patient preferences and various studies which have been undertaken with packs the same group that mirror and I've worked with for many years by Niki McCaffrey and various other authors from PACs I've shown that people in palliative settings their primary preferences are for finalizing affairs which I normally divide into personal affairs and financial affairs and that's really about not leaving a mess for their kids it's not about the finances per se being where they want to be which is their community of choice and often at home not always at home and being with the people they want to be with without distressing them so in general what we have currently in our system are some very expensive medicalised therapy which have very high levels of side-effects and interfere with the ability of patients to finalize their affairs in the setting they want to be they dragged them off to hospital settings and for things like radiotherapy chemotherapy and indeed many forms of securely associated with the opioid use etc so rather than supporting palliative care preferences our current medical model very much reorders the palliative care preferences as though they were survival number one quality of life number two and then a grab bag of everything else we know a palliative preferences are actually for finalizing affairs reducing distress and burden to their carers and family and being where they want to be in the community choice then they talk about their quality of life then they talk about survival so exactly reversed so we have a huge opportunity with medicinal cannabis to address some of these things now this talk really is mainly comes from the chapter 12 of the health economics from theory and practice book where I directly address the US National Academy of Sciences call to have will move beyond what we've got in the first part of this slide which is the evidence about the effects to Public Health and health economics research to inform the debates that I'm talking about here so the evidence from the National Academy of Sciences is that we've got conclusive and some stand of evidence for medicinal cannabis in the treatment of chronic pain and adults which is the most important one because that's 90 percent of use in international incident in the US has some form of chronic pain and 70 percent is the primary symptom for using medicinal cannabis the second one there antiemetics for chemo theory on juice nausea so very much in cancer therapies we're not just getting pain relief we're also getting nausea relief and then the third one there multiple sclerosis spasticity symptoms there's been a couple of other reviews done and some people reminded me last night that there's various other reviews also showing that actually we've got fairly high-level evidence in in a couple of other areas and and particularly in in in some things around limits around epilepsy etc there's moderate evidence of sleep disturbance for malaria and chronic pain with MS and emerging evidence in increasing appetite and degreasing waist loss where of course mirrors work has been going to help inform those emerging forms of evidence and addressing things like Tourette's syndrome anxiety PTSD as we saw in the last session dementia and I oppression glaucoma the key thing is of course that medicinal cannabis can treat multiple things at the same time with the under Cavanaugh and system however to get an analysis which really informs the maximization of net benefit which is what we want in terms of Public Health and health economics policy we need to synthesize that evidence and look at the resource use policy implications in how this can be used as part of current systems and certainly as part of current system reform and that's the core which was made by the US National Academy of Sciences and which really the rest of this talk will address and chapter 12 of the health economics from theory to practice also addresses so since the 1960's since the baby boomers have been around we've in terms of the science and medicinal cannabis discovered the potentially under cabinet system and cb2 and CBC b1 and cb2 receptors and showing the advantages of personal cannabis in particularly varieties rich in CBDs THC terpenes flavonoids etc that bind with his receptors in various ways including a range of chronic disease and palliative care populations which you've seen from National Academy of Sciences but there's also many other reviews out there the key thing in terms of optimizing this use in policy is getting the palette of various medicinal cannabis varieties and provisions customized for the individual patient needs and particularly the pain needs in the populations who are compassionate access populations we also need to allow obviously for the THC tolerance and critically in terms of your intéressant this evidence is being gathered just at the time it's needed when we're going to face these challenges in terms of the health system the health system costs but also the need to actually have appropriate therapies low cost therapies out there for successful aging in doing that the key thing really and the key evidence emerging is around the entourage effects of the terpenes CBDs THC and indeed many other constituent elements of the plant so scientific research highlights that entourage effects between terpenes cama noids and potentially other minor cama noids and indeed flavonoids etc magnify therapeutic effects and dose response curves and minimize side effects and you've seen many of those things over the last couple of days with various presentations importantly and what I'm going to focus on because I'm going to try and focus on pain which is the primary symptom which which is when additional cannabis is used for is the results from a trial which illustrate this quite beautifully and that trial is Johnson at our 2010 so this was a hundred and seventy seven patient double blinded three arm randomized placebo-controlled trial of oral therapies and importantly those three arms were a terpene rich one to one CBD THC a THC alone arm and a opioid alone arm and the evidence from that trial when you look at it is very compelling so in terms of significant pain relief and this was in chronic pain and cancer populations the proportion of patients with the terpene reached THC to CBD one-to-one extract had 43 percent versus 21 percent for the opioid arm and highly statistically significant and that was for a 30 percent improvement so I clinical acidnam so we've got a statistically significant result for a clinically significant improvement in pain relief compared with opioids and importantly it also illustrates the Raaj effect because relative to THC alone we've got almost double as well 43% this is 23% so what it's really pointing to is the very large benefits indeed that medicinal cannabis promises in pain populations over our current therapies opioid therapies I've also put in there a last point around ketamine because we did a large study with packs on ketamine and it was a definitive trial and RCT which conclusively showed that ketamine had no effect on pain relief a little bow while also now producing opioids or rescue medication use and facing significant side effects so apart from the opioids themselves things like ketamine also have been shown to be not effective in pain populations so there's a huge nay a crying need for pain populations to have an appropriate therapy and ideally something in the case of palliative populations which also meets their palliative care needs there needs to finalise Affairs stay at home or stay in their place of choice for the process and indeed the place of death that's going backwards alright so all this comes down to how can health economics help and in many ways for those of who aren't health economists I often get asked what a health economist do and it's really about evidence synthesis we synthesize the clinical evidence the epidemiological evidence the resource use and the cost evidence but what we also do is we inform joint decisions of research reimbursement and regulation and in the case of what we're looking at here that includes related systems to health so aged care systems as well as health systems we also deal with political economy issues and I should say that in medicinal cannabis in all these things I'm talking about it's a classic example we need to look at research reimbursement and regulation together and we need to look at the political economy issues surrounding it what the community preferences are which should be informing the net benefit maximization processes the many vested interests out there and we know there's pharmaceutical interests there's interests of all sorts of manufacturers and of course there's interests which have been around for many years for prohibition etc so health economics allows for the context in this case the baby boomer aging context and how we can optimize the net benefit of therapies such as medicinal cannabis within that context so classically this is the way we combine the evidence and the key thing here is it's not all about the trial evidence the trial evidence are these up on the right hand side they're the individual RCTs or systematic review of evidence and indirect comparisons that only just gives you the relative treatment effect we need to modify that by the population risk factors in your jurisdiction of interest wherever you're making it in the case of Australia that's going to be the Australian population in the case of the UK it's the UK population etc you modify your baseline risks by that relative treatment effect you've got to get the absolute benefits and harms and that's also what GP should be doing they meant to be doing risk benefit assessment etc so what you're really representing here is the decision process for public policy in terms of estimating what the potential clinical benefit is but it's also the process that clinicians go through the bottom line there in that bottom our sphere then combines that with the evidence of resource use and costs to get to net benefit so all net benefit is is the net clinical benefit also allowing for the resource use and cost so it's the value of the effects less their cost is what net benefit represents that's the kind of basic 101 in health economics and how we synthesize the evidence and indeed what we need to do to actually get to a net benefit objective which i think is key in this space because we have at the moment many other political objectives and many other agendas and many other vested interests being represented but not the net benefit to the community which is the key and you need to hammer them over and over again as you can show with health economics how suboptimal it is currently we can show what the optimum is what we have currently and how sub up until we are now in doing that we also need to allow for the joint research reimbursement regulatory decisions and this is a diagram taken from my from my book which gives you the full decision cycle where you're looking at do we have problems in terms of the amount of evidence we have when we do get evidence do we have enough evidence do we need to get further evidence how do we optimize that evidence and the value information methods they're elated that locally but more importantly also globally and so there's many many advantages you get from doing global research collaborating with researchers and having indeed forums like this where you bring that all together the health economist is trying to bring all that evidence together to say what are the net benefit optimising strategies and in the case of the medicinal cannabis what's the way I'm treating each patient that's optimal because as David Bass's pointed to in the very first session we had on the first day it's about precision medicine so optimized we need precision medicine but all these things give you the way to make decisions jointly around research reimbursement and regulation and in the book all the methods around that are described in great detail so to give you a flavor and indeed what you will need in medicinal cannabis to really show the full potential and the full maximizing of net benefit of medicinal cannabis you need to be looking at principles and there's basically coverage and comparability principles that you need to satisfy to optimize joint research reimbursement and regulatory decisions within that there's some very key methods that you need to know about and they're multiple strategy provider or domain comparisons because in reality we've got many many potential strategies out there many many different terpene profiles etc and we need to have methods to look at all of them simultaneously and narrow down very quickly what are the potentially optimal ones from my patient population and then indeed to modify that and at at a policy level research level but in indeed clinician level as well in terms of what you see the response in your patient and then update that evidence to say we need to consider these extra things that we're observed and therefore we might modify our therapy or if it's successful people are going the other thing you're going to need of course is to look at optimal joint research and reimbursement design and there's a whole series of value of information methods out there which a colleague of mine Angie willin and I have devised many of them internationally and various other colleagues as well such as John Kernan in Australia and they allow you to optimize the value of your research relative to the cost to your research and for that we're talking about the burlier we're talking about the value to policy makers and that's going to be key also to drive the policy-making maximizing net benefit in medicinal cannabis you need to have the research design to do that and those methods naturally give you the ability to do that and indeed meet up with the requirements of bodies like the anatomist so you have all of them as their first statement we need to beginning value for our research talk and you can show it with those methods and have much greater success in getting your designs up and get funding that's the key thing but more importantly when you get funding actually make a difference in practice because your research is designed to make a difference in practice we also need unbiased evidence translation synthesis and extrapolation and there's a whole series of methods in the book which which deal with that and that's the point for their finally and this is the most important point in terms of the political economy we need research and better use of existing programs and technologies best expansion and contraction of current options and appropriate pricing in terms of integrating new technology so new technology when we're saying should we invest in new technology what should we be comparing it against the best extension of existing technology and currently we have huge biases in the system which encourage new technology and don't encourage existing technology which is one of the things medicinal cannabis is face because it's a very old technology indeed but we need to be pressing them to say actually this is a very low-cost technology which has huge benefit so in terms of the net clinical benefit of cannabis our particularly medicinal cannabis in the mja in 2013 Mather noted that the benefits of cannabinoid pharmacotherapy can be substantial the risks are generally modest and must be weighed against those and not treating the symptoms or of alternative treatments well apart from the word pharmacotherapy there I'd be very happy with that statement in reality we know that we can use it in plant forms in flower forms etc but importantly what it's pointing to is the huge potential medicinal cannabis has as we've discussed over the last three days we know that the potential side effects are much less than the alternative therapies and particularly in the case I'm looking at in pain management the opioid therapies which have much more severe side effects than the typical tiredness dizziness potential psychological effects from THC and dry mouth also much less than things like ketamine as we've seen ketamine shouldn't be used given the definitive study which has been done to show it's lack of effect and indeed problems with side effects in terms of optimizing we really need to get terpenes CBD and THC which provide is grown for precision medicine use and provided to individual patient needs and that's in terms of sync and control mode of administration dosing and titration and meeting daily functioning needs and typically and I update this slide and in the bottom point every time I hear different talks over time because I'm learning as most people are in this field and we're really talking here currently typically about CBD rich Savita varieties in the daytime and THC rich indica at night so you don't interfere with daily activities and actually get the benefits of sleeping and and pain relief at night etc the evidence we've already pretty much looked at therefore in terms of pain relief how how that plays out in terms of the main trail which which I refer to the Johnson trial we also know from Galilee's study about terpene importance in entourage effect and the dosing that's very important to have those terpenes and how should they provide it well they should be provided as they are being provided in places like Israel with the use of precision medicine and good agricultural practice and physicians customizing to individual patient tolerance and daily needs okay and we've discussed the typical case there as well importantly even where things are suboptimal II done as they are in the US we have very good population level evidence to say that the states with medicinal cannabis programs showed by six years and this is typically quoted as just the average result which was a twenty four point eight percent reduction in opioids but actually what they showed by six years there was a 33 percent reduction and that was increasing over time so when people quite the twenty four eight percent point out and that's not really the effect you expect you expect a much bigger effect over time in that twenty four point eight percent reduction so that was shown by Bukka burr in 2014 what Broadfoot and Broadwood showed last year was that in over 65 populations the populations on we're particularly interested in this talk the medication prescription medication use was 12 percent lower for pain prescriptions and 13 eight to 13 percent lower for anxiety depression nausea sky kosis and sleep order prescriptions these are all the big-ticket items okay so we can see from this why we've got nervousness from pharmaceutical industry particularly because they know that medicinal cannabis therapies and it's been shown with evidence will reduce their prescription medications the key thing is that we've got population evidence of being safer for pain management and the role as an opiate sparing exit drug okay that's provided by that evidence there as well so the usual political kind of games which are played pretending that the medicinal cannabis is is going to be some sort of problem and demon etc are very much exposed as a myth there so we know that medicinal cannabis can avoid many of the common side effects of typical alternative and particularly in my case opioid therapies with pain management or in the case of palliative care and cancer care things like radiotherapy or chemotherapy and those things prevent them from being able to finalize affairs in their community of choice what we need to do is optimize precision use of terpenes CBD and THC which varieties and their modes of administration for patient daily needs and critically in terms of what this means for the health economics it all depends on the way these things are cultivated and the way they're grown to get these THC CBD and terpene rich varieties that's going to determine what the net benefit is to society ok so we're adding in the bit from that clinical benefit to extend to net benefit and in that space there's a very clear set of evidence out there about indoor versus outdoor costs and opportunity cost so to optimize therapy benefits compassion and access providers need to access to appropriate terpenes CBD and th which strains and we know that the best terpenes in particular and indeed the highest quality terpenes are grown outdoors or more generally in sunlight air and natural soil conditions the halfway house of course between indoor and outdoor is the greenhouse and we can certainly address or try to address in the greenhouse many of the things that you can't address indoors to try and get better air and sunlight and soil conditions however we know the best conditions are the natural conditions where you can grow them so where you have the climate and we have that in Australia and we have it in abundance but we also have the sub climates that you need to grow all the different types of varieties so we know that higher yielding terpene rich strains grow better with natural sunlight air and space to reach the natural height but also to get the quality of terpenes that we'd like to express and particularly from the f1 females that we want to have to get the best terpenes the other thing we really need to look at is the cost of course and the best estimates of fact the costs of outdoor cultivation and drying to good agricultural practice and indeed what's increase living showed also good manufacturing practice between 10 and 20 cents per gram of cannabis and that was from 2010 there may be some slight inflation from there from Caulkins but importantly the relativity of that cost to cost him in a greenhouse it's about 40 percent of the costs in greenhouse which is two and a half times more at 25 to 50 percent since per gram and hydroponic with indoor costs 10 times the amount growing it out to us $1 to tear lives 50 so it's not just that we're getting the best terpene profiles etc we're also getting about tenth the cost so the cost of indoor cultivation is approximately 10 fold outdoor production and 4 fold that in greenhouses and for distributed manufacturing costs so that's just the basic cost this translates to about $10 vs. 2050 versus $1 per gram indoor growing also faces many other issues around plant disease mold plant quality and high energy use in attempting replicate growing conditions with natural air and sunlight so this lovely quotes out there from various sources and this is my favorite one in an virtuous cycle the intense heat from the Wrights requires air conditioning and fans to keep growing rooms at 75 degrees Fahrenheit a deem heat of fire to prevent mold and a carbon dioxide injection system incredibly intense energy use and use of high technology what are they trying to do recreate sunlight and air and soil conditions the bottom line here is that a pound grown indoors has energy consumption equivalent to driving across America 7 times ok huge energy consumption it now in America with 1 million users in 2015 was more than 1% of national energy consumption and the carbon dioxide emissions from indoor growing were the equivalent of 3 million cars ok so I suggest Australia should be learning from the experience in America and not growing it indoors because in reality it's not just about the quality it's about the cost and the environmental impact that this has if we looked at a whole program cost and the moment we can estimate from the US prevalence that there be about 200,000 for pain management alone in Australia and we know that 90% of symptoms are treated in the u.s. for pain and 70% is the primary symptom well that $1.00 per day or Bella per gram is shining' people use 1 gram per day you would get one dollar per day per person versus 11 dollars with alternative forms of pain management or endo indoor growing so you have basically effect a price saving at 1 gram per day of Australian $10 a day or 730 million dollars per year domestically so 200,000 people 365 dollars is what they end up paying rather than just over 4000 dollars you say three thousand six hundred and fifty dollars per person and seven hundred and thirty million dollars per year domestically that's just the direct cost saving in a sliders who I'll show you some of the downstream cost savings and they are even greater we also of course if we grow the highest quality things outdoors and at that low cost have huge export potential from both quality and cost comparative advantages well I'm going backwards again so in Australia where we have the environments with environment to grow these things outdoors and indeed do it in micro climates to optimize for each variety it optimizes the range and quality of cannabis varieties required to optimize net clinical benefit with precision medicine and particularly in the compassion access and palliative populations it minimizes the cultivation costs and environmental impacts and it supports continuing research buffers precision medicine in optimizing patient preferences and palliative preferences daily needs and tolerance of compassion access populations so the bottom line is that medicinal cannabis for chronic pain and palliative care in Australia outdoor cultivation of terpenes CBD and th which medicines with good agricultural practice and precision medicine provision enables physicians to maximize the individual net clinical benefit for improved pain management reduce side effects whether the opioids and other pain therapies such as ketamine and of course doing this appropriate for risk benefit assessment as we saw seen extensively in the lovely course that David called the Cochran on day one and in terms of motive ministration and hydration of dose we already have very many examples such as gabapentin to rely on for the types of titration we can use for the pelvic population it facilitates all those extra dimensions the palliative populations have in terms of finalizing affairs in the community of choice and reducing family in care or distress it also supports robust research optimizing right varieties by individual patient symptom needs and all the other factors that we're interested in in risk benefit assessment and save ten dollars per day indirect pain management but what I've got on the bottom there is also the downstream costs you say so the extra 22% of the population in the case of Peleliu patients or cancer patients who have better pain control we don't expect to go into a hospital setting and there's evidence there that you save about thirteen thousand dollars from them not going into hospital setting for that type of pain management across the population that's actually several billion dollars in terms of chronic pain and finally it ensures quality controlled Australian medicinal supply while creating scope for future export market and minimizing energy use and in conclusion coming back to our successful baby boomer aging successful baby boomer aging pioneers for all but affordable reform needs to be addressed and particularly end-of-life challenges and that abuse of existing technologies and integrating new technologies given their opportunity costs at their price in these respects in all these respects optimal use of medicinal cannabis is key in addressing palliative care options and the Preferences of patients better research and the actual net benefit is expected in practice the big point at the bottom is a major challenge as ever is getting community voices heard in other words the net benefit maximizing heard in the in the process and having health systems serve those community preferences not the vested interests not the role and there's a role here very much for things like citizens juries in complex decision makings which Gavin Mooney in his lovely book the health of Nations towards a new political economy points to

Yes we cannabis,2018-06-04T00:57:02Z,[Music] the 9th of May 2018 I introduced a bill to legalize cannabis and the Commonwealth law it would still be subject to state law but at least the Commonwealth's government if it passed at this the Commonwealth Government wouldn't be involved in it now cannabis is not a particularly harmful product it's not addictive can be habitual but it's not addictive it doesn't cause harm to others when people consume cannabis smoke it you've never heard of somebody getting into a fight because of smoking cannabis whereas it obviously after drinking alcohol plenty of people get into fights cannabis prohibition is very costly to enforce there are police running around trying to catch people using it growing and supplying and selling it and of course customs spend a lot of time and money trying to intercept it when it's being smuggled into the country and prohibition also prevents a legitimate industry in the states and countries overseas that that allow legalized cannabis they tax it the businesses are legal there are not involved with crime they employ people those people pay taxes it's all part of a legitimate industry we don't have that because of prohibition in fact what we do have is a black market obviously which funds criminal activity the people involved in cannabis supply in Australia in are in many cases criminals also supplying other drugs now I don't necessarily advocate promote endorse the use of cannabis but it's important that from my perspective that we have freedom to choose it's if you're not harming anybody else it should be up to you not up to the government other parties ignore this I'm David lying home from the Liberal Democrats and I support freedom [Music]
Q1U2o5Pq07A,Australia faces massive oversupply of medicinal cannabis,2018-01-20T13:34:29Z,
46WDfmZRbnY,Doubts raised over marijuana’s medical benefits,2018-02-16T16:15:32Z,"the medical cannabis industry is booming with good reason the number of patients with prescriptions has quadrupled in just two years cannabis is being used to treat a long list of conditions from arthritis to anxiety despite its growing use the science supporting medicinal cannabis just isn't there the key research that we need is missing in a large number of areas or it's quite poor the new guidelines say there is some research to show cannabis might alleviate neuropathic or nerve pain palliative cancer pain nausea from chemotherapy symptoms related to multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury that's it these guidelines are timely for people at this workshop employers are facing growing demands for insurance coverage for prescription cannabis that's a workshop and medical user Jonathan's Aid is making his case have a great quality of life and really medical cannabis has allowed me to have that when he was a teen Zaid says he had debilitating headaches that kept him home from school now he lobbies for greater patient access he acknowledges the research is weak with that said there's over 200,000 Canadians that are using cannabis for medical purposes with the authorization of their physician they're finding relief from cannabis they're finding increased quality of life we help prescribe cannabis his family physician also works for a medical cannabis company he worries the guidelines will lead to doctors at dismissing cannabis as a treatment option for other conditions such as arthritis or seizures even though their patients may find relief we can't continue to tell them that what they're telling us is not true we can't just you know continue to have that paternalistic point in my opinion advocates for medical cannabis agree there is a need for better clinical trials but cannabis is not a typical pharmaceutical no one company holds the exclusive right to it so there's little incentive to pay for the research Vica dopey a CBC News Toronto"
QdYu2rj6NQs,Cutting Through the Haze - Medicinal Cannabis Public Event - Part 2,2018-10-24T23:54:17Z,"[Music] [Applause] thank you to professor O'Brien or the [Music] slide set doctor over we reinforcing some of this is some of the slides that I have some of the material really is is very much the same so we'll get right into it here and the center here is this treasure trove of molecules that have tremendously and you did hear their words were cannabinoids in my game something indirectly about the 50 order feet please work together to be a powerful medicine so we usually medicine I want you to consider some of the uses tonight and some of the risks and benefits that are alleged also somebody is behind us and those assertions of Marcus this is a very common place in the media these days having people believe that this is really a dangerous of those which is quite honestly it is not I think California cannabis medicine about now here's connection my experience ditch back over 40 years now we're equation to do cannabis I have no religion too close to disclose of associated companies I just said they have an idea about how the system is swinging in the United States they're nearly 77 in the united states are living in state Senate reform underground allows to allow this piece of marijuana this is we've all the way deceased workers it's about the seconds that you can be hearing about on molecules that fit into those receptors those are natural and opioid receptors and make things happen and then there are the plant and a Banaras that similarly get into these receptors and do the work or b of the cannabinoids are the endocannabinoids these help us in general to come back and on your stations to help us with eating and sleeping and relaxing and forgiving in a good kind of way and to protect us in many different ways so here you have hi drone on top right and humans on the lower left sea squirts in the fishing village in the reptiles all the system is pretty deserve it or over 6000 million years of evolution because that works it keeps us together it helps us to feed into sleep and relax when we need to you when we label see that they show up want to bring these mutts hops with the Reds and the oranges and the yellows are easy to concentrate the various authorities cannabinoid receptors are found we call these cb1 receptors they're emptying the immune system our necks are elevated and the nervous system in the immune system that is in this slide as time goes along after injection they show up in the liver and the spleen the tonsils volumous bone marrow and to out the body skin in other organs she's a big moment in the skeleton highlighting many of these these parts of the body so these cannabinoids are naturally there and maybe cannabis as medicine to go to these sites and do the things that they're capable of doing if we're elicited the CB once or novel and the nervous system in the spinal cord where the peripheral nerves they're going to these organs listed on the right-hand column I'm sorry that would be the left hand held and the CDG and our immune system so these serve yourselves homicides macrophages the T cells and B cells lymphocytes ever involved in new responses B plus the liver spleen and conscious bone marrow and so forth so these are all around the body with the endocannabinoid system when we add that of things that we do this is Alyssa's the pharmacological properties into cannabinoids it's a lot less than I would consider reading is do you take note of the fact that it has so many different things because these receptors are located in so many different tissues they do all of these different things they're coding analgesics they're very helpful for nausea vomiting and have a high stimulation there's a very very potent anti-inflammatory medications they're immunosuppressive so they hope the model human diseases and so forth so rather than reading them by the way if anybody wants to give you a business partner give me an email address I'll send this PowerPoint valuable information for you got your stand and share with Granderson this is representing what these acceptors are basically the white where you see the dots connected the blue dots of the cb1 receptors there to be no assets in strength that makes that that cannabinoid receptor and debride waste are they are the dots associated with cb2 receptor they've matched that in those places for Atlee where you see the next to one another when they swallow as protein does make for moussaka and that safa goes into the cell membranes in the tissues around the body and there is ready to business to receive the cannabinoids and do those four men launch of things that we're speaking of one changed in these string of God's will of a function of the cannabinoid receptor it does not work as well like one not change as you can think of it perhaps like like a sock or like like a lot if you change one of the littlest points in the walk it may not work with the key so in the cannabinoid receptor a subtle difference in that in a separate just does not work as well and when Amazon runs both of these endocannabinoid deficiency diseases we're seeing this in the genetic material of these various various minor changes in these cannabinoid receptors affects whether or not a few seconds awarded for properly and makes us from the various diseases this is natural and building that Alexa like they're made on demand next to the receptors they're used and then they're broken down and then they come back again whenever we need them their platinum cannabinoids although these would prefer the natural cannabinoids see for example fits into the same receptor and activates it's just a big natural cannabinoids can do I point out the differences here at THC and CBD the THC being the one on the Left that activates the receptor CPM and over on the right doesn't unlock the receptor it's the same atomic weight almost identical molecule but to see than a pointer yes I do this hydrogen atom came from this point over the oxygen opened the ring and in doing that that changing shaking down olive oil just enough to where it can get into the receptor so the CTD accidentally different way and actually stimulates more of their natural and it's to be upregulated by altering the way that the natural phenomena have broken down it has this very concept and a banana fact this th TV is one of the plant that is at the bottom and notice that the only difference between THC here at the top and th TV it's the length of this tail and at the bottom of the molecule it simply means that as the key in the receptor it's not longer to to activate the receptor so it actually acts as a mild blocker receptor in is actually useful medicine in being able myelinated receptor so this is again reinforcing this idea that the endocannabinoid system don't all work the same our genetic variability in these receptors or polymorphisms as we call them affect the functionality of the endocannabinoid system resulting in what we call endocannabinoid deficiency syndrome these diseases are implicated and send them in economic efficiencies so it's easy to use animus to upregulate to augment the natural system and help our communities conditions cannabinoids are retrograde messengers can synapse I'll show you are just a minute the cannabinoids don't go in the direction company neurotransmitters they go in the opposite direction to inform the presynaptic cell to slow down and stop signaling so it breaks on the system in our brain it's great for anxiety it's great for pain it does many things by down-regulating the neurotransmission so here's this in that glutamate in these cases this neurotransmitter so we're talking about two nerves next to each other one of them is sending the signal through the other posts in that neuron and so as you see here there's very little to make the initial receptor synapse when we turn it up it begins to activate you do to make acceptor and not immense materials and that might be cannabinoids represented here in the lower right corner of the slide these are the natural and they're produced in this postsynaptic cell they cross over to the presynaptic cell where that cannabinoid receptor resides and when inactivation separate stops the production of the releases a neurotransmitter so again is the brake or some of our system it helps us with all kinds of things by modulating the toll you are marking nervous system it's quite remarkable what it would exercise to do now the federal government in the United States knows all about it and they know that we modulating are in the cannabinoid system as they say they have their creative potential and almost all diseases affecting humans including and then this laundry list of conditioned metabolic say diabetes a diabetic complications or regenerative diseases inflammatory diseases cardiovascular lavatory liver diseases gastrointestinal skin diseases hanging psychiatric disorders cachexia which is a wasting syndrome cancers people care to reduce nausea and vomiting and many others have dependence on diseases and then the unrestricted gear so it's not the federal government doesn't understand this they just think that cannabis is not the medicine that they bring us this moderation they went on extend this over to the pharmaceutical industry let them bring you a new generation of drugs what we're doing then is using cannabis instead and my ability is receptors now there is the regulator in their cannabinoid system and they include exercise and massage manipulation acupuncture these will temporarily of regulator natural phenomenon system acetaminophen or paracetamol and the various Idzik nonsteroidal antiinflammatory molecules these have great products that actually are responsible for regulating our natural cannabinoid system this made me at least in part are how they work for reducing pain and there is pathological dishes to will up regulate our natural endocannabinoids system in response to injury illness weaknesses this is where the natural phenomena is to come to the rest area there's a very interesting set of tests that went on early on back in the 90s when they would tie off blood vessels going to the brain Romantics causing the throat and the ones that they gave me extra cannabinoid Institute that reduces stroke volume where it was very small relative to what happened otherwise so these natural cannabinoids for the plant cannabinoids for capable of protecting our nervous system they were actually all enantiomers legs in Isreal summers they were using synthetic and it didn't work very well if you were using the whole plan and I like to be able to preserve your logic function people haven't strokin your lunch injuries but we haven't really done that so is in the medicine and we use it as a therapeutic agent when we're considering really reduces canvas we after what if there is amendments administration and the bioavailability anyhow all these molecules actually given to our bloodstream can analyse images and I'm gonna talk about this molecules work better together than they do alone in many cases they don't work at all on their singing single now happiness as isolated molecules canvas is also an adaptogen what that is is if the cannabis forget to sleep at night and during the day time it's not gonna put you back to sleep you already got your rest if you need to be in that the noise can help you be or help your appetite but if you have campuses not gonna drive around hitches you get what you need so it's an advantage in that fashion there are neutral versus but this inches that the plant is alive and growing all of these cannabinoids that we're talking about my plan are in an acid form so it's not - its - hey / - yes see - da and so forth so all they can now do now is there is a NASA forum earn their degree the plan and then they gradually what we call decarboxylated into the active forums actually they're both electrically a supports and the neutral ones are active molecules they're really quite different medicines and numb themselves so we make you system pharmacologically because we produce medicines these fresh molecules the essence molecules and they work very nicely and learn other things the acid THC is not psychoactive so it gives us a nice tool to use when we need to get an effect that's related to THC without a site for activity hopeful and there's a single molecule CBD I think of n skip over this is suffice to say the aren't the same if you are to give CBD online and this is pure CBDs tricky to use because it has a biphasic response meaning a little bit doesn't do much just who i that works really well and if you go up on the doses it loses its efficacy it doesn't work as well anyone so comparing right CVV it works in a linear fashion because the dose the bigger the effect so you're not looking for an isolated molecule CBP selection of specific course I have done this a little bit coming up tolerance and autoregulation inverses in fact that when we're looking at those cannabinoid receptors where they're sitting in that cell membrane reading the roses if you're using cannabis on a regular basis some of those receptors will actually back into the cell they're kind of immaterial the body recognizes that you don't need as many of them around but there are targets that would be on the receptors as well as only maybe you can discreetly for various conditions where the expand trees were epilepsy or whatever there are non separate targets of these cannabinoids so going up on doses very high accomplishes a couple things one of them as you get a much smaller effect the other thing is the psycho activity that graduation diminishes so that you can have massive doses of cannabinoids that you're using or or or or even smoking and vaporizing and they're not gonna get high who uses them so people get very tolerant of these molecules as far as the absorbing and bioavailability how well these indexes and dumped on the bloodstream for smoking date you keep it up above 50% of it actually ends up in the Bloods area where is that they're very casually huffing on a hike or something you may not get much into your bloodstream but they really hold on to it and they're once you get over half of it into the bloodstream world warms on the other hand think of it like this everything's in the esophagus all the way to the other end of the record goes by way of the portal veins of the livers verse and the liver has its way with me to plant molecules and breaks down the vast majority only before they ever get in your bloodstream it's just the way it is used normally on the timeless medicines but we actually lose you deal with it by way of delivering there are suppository horns we don't know too much about this well we do when we don't 20 years ago we learned that THC was as a suppository if it were converted to a different molecule prodrug if you will wear as a blended with an ester and made into something that's absorbable it will give could be protonated the body so we really need to develop and create many students never going to work with suppositories they're gonna be really valuable analysis as well we also have a tobacco use and to manage during our use of cannabis topical meaning it works on the surface so it's working on skin rash and itching and it's working on skin cancers and skin and all kinds of skin related diseases whereas if we can use something that's a solvent I'll get it through the skin otherwise does not penetrate very well at all then we can get a blood level with a transdermal a warmer up to cannabis in a pack but then it has to have some kind of a vehicle to get it through the skin otherwise I'll just leave these oils will penetrate the skin very well otherwise this is a graph showing listen capitalism when it comes to smoking or vaporizing cannabis and I want to say that when you poop on a cannabis pipe to join or whatever you get a rapid piece in five or ten minutes it's very high attach right on it and once Trinity's not hugging the liver first and then over that first hour it drops significantly down into this range in that one hour where it's just a fraction but it started out this solid line is what the THC term you do it's not a pharmacologically active it doesn't do anything for itself so it's only this first couple hours when using canvas by the impaler out gets in your system and it's useful when we look at these curved or ingesting cannabis eating these molecules with the tincture these two coils and chocolates and fragments malahide products we see that they don't even show up about Oh 45 minutes and then they begin to come into your bloodstream after it has to deliver but again take a look at what happened as it went through the liver the solid line is the inactive metabolites that we call carboxy THC so these molecules are largely broken down the ones that we do get into the bloodstream peak in about two hours when they last about six or eight hours depending on the dose so you can have a very light by Alex we're in series making massive dose and it made life that much as ten twelve dollars so this is a little bit about the pharmacodynamics if you will and how we use these medicines we might use vocal inhaled forms of medicine cannabis medicines and oral forms in order to accomplish different things if you're really an acute pain and need relief right now cannabis is helpful and inhale form right now where is Nikki and orderly or in the heck you're waiting 45 minutes before you're going to feel any abatement so we make you see these different methods of administration in order to accomplish the pharmacologic benefits we know from the syllogism that we were talking about that we're mixing in THC and CBD together at least as two molecules in these models THC or to retain CBD workers made but if you put them together they were crunch Rebecca there's a sinners in the demonic jewels similarly in dancers treatment we see this industry and this graph comes out of a laboratory in San Francisco on the left-hand column there was this is these are tumor cell or accounting again to test students so the column on the left is a cancer cells at one hundred percent of the population although there's been no cannabinoid added the next column here this white column this one we've added this much THC to that test tube of cancer cells these cancer cells happen to be that brain tumor cell called the Leo blastoma very ready to so if we've given this much THC it'll knock down the population of those cancer cells about half the CBD on the next column is a very small dose of CBD and it knocks the column down now the third if you put those two together here's the column on the right hand side is the synergy these molecules are working from far better together than they do individually so we take advantages as well we want to use the whole plant medicine when we're treating cancers because it works a lot better this is going back to a storm remember we're talking about the plant when it's green is in the acid form the part of the molecule that is the asset is what we call a carboxyl group right here on the THC molecule or the THC a molecule when it's heated or prolonged drive and drive a long time it will lose that carboxyl group is absent over here and then it becomes psychoactive so the THC a THC different molecules both pharmacologically important one of them cycle one of the misses so medicines are available that are focusing on these Asha forms it can be very useful when you don't want to have this activity this is I'm making the point that I spoke of earlier about single molecule CVD versus the whole plant CBD so on the left hand side we see sorry we see a column treating pain in an animal yep not much pain relief on the left optimal pain relief about hair in the middle and then as you go on line those and you begin to lose angrily similarly at the bottom this is I'm sorry this one is from pain on the bottom this is from swelling on the top so swelling improves and then gets worse again and pain is improved and then it gets worse again now if on the other hand we're using a whole plant extract of these columns on the right you can see that the swelling continues to come down and the pain continues to be relieved so you're looking for her products again we do have cannabinoids in what we call type creates sort of a simplistic way of looking at it regular marijuana being type one where the ratio take C to C de that you've been hearing about it is in roughly a 100 to 1 ratio could be 50 to one could be a hundred to one 151 miles way appointed season CD there are other strange and unnatural cannabis strengths or have been propagating that are more or less balanced the type twos are more or less equal to 40 THC and CBD they're very versatile medicines because they have an identity and we have symmetry of these molecules are working very well as medicine and then finally we have type trees which are predominantly CBD and these are very helpful we really don't want to have somebody getting high and there are those situations so type 3 cannabis is very useful as well amp happens to be predominantly the CPD THC has to be very low for it to qualify as an investor loses the switch two years ago led by dr. Debbie Nereus name was mentioned by Amazon Israel the doctor the chemist at the Cancer Institute in Haifa he pointed out that they were using cannabis for autism in Israel Putnam's extensively treated process of fantastic results the kids learned in his increase their education their anxiety it's a much much improved well they were going along the kids came into the study with bad eggs with bad anxiety bad behaviour here on the left and as they got established on these icdd strange they noted that all of these markers began to improve early gave me much less anxious they're learning to change drastically in some cases and everybody was happy well all of a sudden the caregiver said what interview is not working the kids ended up back here they're starting again they asked what's up took the medicine and it was supposedly the same CBD medicine well when they looked in the laboratory we got familiar we found that it was not singing the THC and the CVV were the same and I'm going to point to those right here were these big arrows are here's the CBD in two different strengths compound 266 was the one that were compound 267 on the right-hand columns what's the one that didn't work so again 266 words 267 didn't work well the THC and CBD were the same it was going to be the same but you'll notice the batch worker about how different the concentrations are on these minor cannabinoids that was enough to make a difference they didn't work the same so they went back to the original strain gave it to the kitchen they all got lemon in it there's a lot of difference between these strains and we need to propagate a lot of different cannabis in order to really optimize our therapeutic options so it's not about selecting one stranger possessing the work for all things have just listed that kind of medicine we really need to encourage the propagation of hundreds of different strains to learn from but we need to ignore their roots these medicines best I'm going to move into assertions of farmer just a little bit there's if you're only watching the news you're going to find them generously pink there's a lot of fear associated with candidates a lot of assertion of harm and I want to just pull the veil back a little bit and show you that there's a lot of confirmation first of all this is justice there's surgeries of addiction psychosis schizophrenia its impairment fetal and neonatal one let's step into this a little bit my mentor eNOS is balance catching professor emeritus Institute on Drug Abuse for 45 years the barman cannabis and what it shows is that smoking cannabis and we don't have to smoke that we can make drugs or we've ingested the smoking cannabis does dirty airway isn't ours there's heat there irritants in the mucosa they do cause that precip of the swelling of the airway inflammation generally they do person increases in mucus production and beyond that there is not much harm to the pulmonary system their drunken dilators doesn't cause the constriction that regular smoking causes a hopeless the airway not closes down he shows that there's no significant increase in the pulmonary function studies in heavy cannabis smokers chronic cannabis smokers which is to say they don't see COPD or emphysema and chronic marijuana smokers it just doesn't hurt and happens on the show and epidemiologic study that there is no increase in the risk of cancers of the lung of the airwaves so lungs trachea larynx pharynx and esophagus argument there is no increase in the cancers of those who are very cannabis smokers and in fact those and the cannabis smokers have a 37 percent decrease in the risk of developing these answers so these cannabinoids are killing off the abnormal cells John what about short hair remember this has been observed them they have a chronic migraine genome animus smokers but they virtually disappears after you stop using it even a day or so and not see any impairment of memory but that's kind of been a few weeks you don't see in the alteration of the brains at all even in the chronic features cognitive performance there's commitment and a meta-analysis is a study of studies so there are 33 studies looking at cognitive performance and the conclusions of this study is in valuating users after at least 25 days it looks into abstention found no residual effects on cognitive performance these results failed to support an idea and heavy cannabis usually results a long-term persistent effects on neuropsychological function Elizabeth chemistry to toggle informants this is another study that heard more recently in the 2014 they've concluded that after a standing from cannabis use 33 adults did not differ in IQ attention memory or executive functions compared to non-users lower rating we have associated cannabis usage in high school abuses lost statistical significance when controlling for concomitant alcohol and tobacco use if you mix it together it works like cannabis is causing lower IQs and lower grade point averages but if you control for that disappears campus alone does not affect grade point averages in these high school speakers now our authors closer than that same method there are neurotoxic effects of cannabis on the developing brain and permanently lower its IQ this study is referring to in which position to make the operator to the ceiling that's where the study was this is study at the University of Oxford Oxford to find the conclusions premature in light of light and confounding and socioeconomic status so she loves to quote it is very superior but it's not true I create an educational outcomes and teenagers related to their campus here's another study its prospective study 235 teens and the finding suggests that a dress of Candice's is not associated in higher education of performance another association campus with cognitive functioning analysis and young adults a systemic review another meta-analysis in this case 69 study of over 20 152 cannabis use and 6575 control versus who were not high on their seizures and the conclusions of the studies word that the association began between cannabis uses cognitive functioning in cross-sectional studies of adolescence young adults are small and may be of questionable clinical importance reversal individuals so again it just depends on what you're really going through this listen to the news if you're listening to the news you're gonna think this is dangerous stuff but if you're reading the literature it's not supported by the literature here's another now we're going on to bring structure an alteration to call a brain more knowledgeable this is a study that was going on back over ten years ago looking in specific parts of the brain work harder or concentrated cannabinoid receptors and the conclusions were that the results provide new evidence structural abnormalities in hippocampus amygdala in Walter I'm gonna be campus users and corroborate similar findings in the animal literature these findings indicate not here's one lease care papers that came out these findings indicated heavy activity cannabis uses across subtract experience researchers harmful effects on brain tissue and mental health so they threw it all day they just said that this is dangerous stuff affect your brain and affects the structures in the brain and affects your mental health well fence jumped on the bandwagon in the United States and commissioned another test I killed him that was done in 2014 and he looked at these structures again in this case the nucleus accumbens and the amygdala of the brain and young adults these data were suggested that he suggested that marijuana exposure even in younger recreational users is associated with exposure and an alteration of the neural matrix of core reward structures and his insistence in the animal studies have changes in dendritic arborization so we're using a lot of words that basically say the cannabis is messing up the brain well it didn't hold on them what they did find is that those marijuana smokers that we're also drinking a lot of alcohol when they control more alcohol these changes disappear so this is a study language done a year later by violent daily marijuana use is not associated bringing structured Maisie's in adolescence or adults the study examined the brain structures and in their conclusions the results indicated we carefully controlling for alcohol use gender age and other variables there is no association between marijuana use and standard volumetric or shape initiatives of these way men cortical structures so again depends on the research that you're reading you're gonna find you're gonna find incriminating researchers some studies that are going to findings online your research analysis clinically is something he's been doing this work for 40 years I don't see any damage in the kids or the adults these are right people they running company Messiah why others without officers doctors lawyers the Superior Court justices are a community can regular basis and you would know it and it's it's certainly nothing that anybody needs to know about that people use canvas for all kinds of things and it really does suck on some part actually is a lot of good here's another great management is associated in any cannabis use this one is done another road bike owners Blackrock significant differences in great amount of inner peace organs bringing support of the structure the lack of significant differences in the great vigor various changes between young adult having campus users who healthy controls over time I suggest that evidence does not reduce regional remember Barrios in this period of time last inspector which is believe in this one was a three years doesn't this isn't as anything and what I would particularly draw your attention to it's in the United States we must temper the fact that being our federal government tells us that people become addicted 900 Center about one out of ten people here can become addicted to cannabis the figure [Music] that's you know this is a really very on it's possible but it's rare there's a study that night I want you to be aware of a missus done in the UK it was over a ten-year period from 1995 and 96 until 2005 and during that time period 2.3 of the UK population evaluators it's a friend Emily psychosis almost 600,000 patients per year were evaluated they're developing these bt to the progress the UK study reported that cannabis tension increases for role in the dull between 1970 mm too big increase his adults but look what happened with the kids there was a 15 fold increase in the usage campus and 1800 population 18 yo and younger population so the conclusions of the paper that was written the incidence and prevalence of schizophrenia and psychosis were either stable or declining very redneck 1996 to 2005 so we're going to have that as increases in psychosis in in the human population and this evidence is also to show that we're not seeing any in my purpose of schizophrenia worldwide what can have a uses much more and more throughout the world impairment well I'm here for the correlation and interfering of driver skills is something to consider I think anybody is new to cannabis should be very careful to drive soon after losing tenants that kind of goes without any question we don't want to see more risks and accidents in Jersey Falls associative using cannabis when people really start over than especially my older population I'll give them a lot of questions about using cannabis and giving up for example in the bathroom at night whole lot of the things like your little lose your water and you're getting these two using this medicine we have some majors of anterior executive functioning including the wonderful herbal critical tasking tracking tasks Tower of London today's signal tasks Iowa ambling tasks these are ways to try to assess people's in camera and yes we can see impairment in this population was working easy to keeper measures but what about traffic accidents and then uses handedness system this was a study done by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and reported to Congress in the United States and they said that in a double-blind placebo-controlled study of 21 heavy cannabis users assess the impact and assessing the impact of alcohol or THC in these various tasks could attract divided attention stop signal tasks and cognition the study study generally confirmed that heavily cannabis users developed a tolerance to the Imperial effects of THC on neurocognitive casa formulas so if they're regular users they don't show any impairment even if their blood levels are extremely high and so what levels are not a quick way to really assess this somebody who's using cannabis and it's new to it they have a certain work level somebody who is a regular cannabis user for years is going to happen 20 times a blood level but may not have a clear mind so ever here's another nation Highway Traffic Safety Administration test that's completed in 2015 I can see my time has come to an end a drivers for THC and their systems adjust our age waistlock all were no more likely to crash than those who had not these drugs are help before getting behind the wheel corroborates the fact that we don't really see the accidents and injuries much that's been heard good what should we believe by you know I think I probably wrap it this I don't want to go in trouble here the term abuse we don't see troubles with the babies and as far as that adverse effects yeah we'll get dry mouth on injected eyes and steady gauge some short-term memory loss all of those things to clear up with regular use it is an air to the airway I spoke of it rarely people faint when they use cannabis is rarely really seen anxiety and panic attacks but those things can happen there's a rare thing called a hyperemesis syndrome with its retina readily this is here's a cessation in canvas user even today there is a drug drug reactions between and that the dye obviously be in certain anticonvulsants so you have to be careful monitoring those and if you bought some drugs when using high doses of CBD and that is it thank you very much [Applause]"

snzC9oA2YwA,CANN GROUP - Shining light on medicinal cannabis,2018-10-25T05:32:19Z,cannabis has long been used for therapeutic purposes thanks to new laws Australian researchers and clinicians can now evaluate its medicinal value using an evidence-based approach the TGA has approved medicinal cannabis for the following indications and cannabis can now be legally prescribed for authorized patients to enhance their quality of life without relying on the black market that's why can group exists as Australia's first commercial grower can group will supply cannabis extracts for use by authorized researchers and approved patients we will enable the generation of scientific data needed to understand its therapeutic value cannabis contains a complex array of cannabinoids terpenes and other biologically active components with cannabis strains containing differing amounts of each finding the right combination for each patient and medical condition is the true medical challenge atcond group we will precisely characterize the key active components in our pharmacy grade cannabis products with genetic materials from leading Canadian producer and can shareholder Aurora and Avandia we're developing elite new strains to tailor patient treatments we're collaborating with pre-eminent Australian research institutions to publish findings from translational research clinical studies and patient experiences and we're ready to support other researchers and clinicians looking to unlock the therapeutic potential of cannabis want to know more we're here to help [Music]
IlSlD71arKw,"Health Sub-committee A, Pt 3: Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Bill",2018-05-03T10:05:48Z,"thank you delicious mr. Nicholas Brandon here can I call you no please come to the table thank you thank you very much for making the effort to make this Commission so Nick you can use an edge cruise thank you but I will be and this is just for us more than it is for you actually I'm keeping us vital because we're sitting in till 6:00 so I will be timing you and I just have to find my where is that seating issue for me can you can have extra time okay thank you the first thing I'd like to add to the written submission is that New Zealand has led the way in so many areas of social change it gave women the vote was the first country to do that we're very early on the homosexual law reform we had nuclear-free we had same-sex marriage you know we were right at the forefront of all these things and so why are we being so slow to make medical marijuana available to patients with chronic illnesses who are being denied a medicinal drug that could be of value to them so I'm asking you to have some empathy do the right thing there are I just can't imagine what people are afraid of is it really seeing a clip of reefer madness back in the 50s that is fueling people's scared nests of this drug and the benefits that will come from it being available in a regulated manner but also ask you to consider declassifying THC as well as CBD and in the derivatives of it because experience and other juror fiction's has shown that it is a combination of the two in that some proportion or other that yields the most beneficial outcome for people on a buddhist '''l basis there are some activity going on between the two components that enhances whatever it is that the benefit is so what we're not I don't know the science behind it but there is in other jurisdictions they have found that this therapeutic enhancement occurs when these two drugs are combined the percentage of each to be used for each individual as a trial and error process but you need to have really properly laboratory tested drugs available so that you know what you're getting that you've got ten percent or 20 percent of one or the other so please consider be classifying THC and and the other CBD derivatives and there's no need to reinvent the wheel that's been done before elsewhere successfully so I'm Thomas taking the other thing is to think of the economic benefits that could be derived for some of the poorer regions in our country I'm thinking particularly the east coast or the far north there are really great financial opportunities for people in those regions to benefit from employment and from putting their skills to use in a in a good way rather than growing it for the black market and in the establishment of laboratories and internationally measured facilities so I think there's is a real number of wins out of being a bit more outward looking in terms of your approach in the final thing I'd like to say is that as a person who has a chronic disease which there is currently no treatment of are the the current model for research and development of medication relies on funding from drug companies largely and so as a result they're not interested in finding cures for anything that will damage the cash flows so what they're interested in doing is keeping as many people sick and reliant on regular medication rather than finding a cure so we have to somehow break that model which is deeply flawed and find some way to fund researchers and medical schools and universities to come up with better solutions that actually solve the problem don't just a band-aid to put on it and that's that's all I had to say I'm not available to answer questions if anyone is community if I've been identified for a long time as a potential kind of research cohort I agree with you I think we do need to have a lot more research from some of the evidence we've heard there have been fantastical companies who have explored I guess the potential of medicinal cannabis and actually chose not to progress probably for some of the reasons you've highlighted because there are the products we're selling in particular ways were being used in particular ways that may have been undermined that you never will produce something it was a bit more effective and cheaper but I think the whole issue about a research agenda at a partnership between researchers and indistinct communities is really valid and I know in Australia that they have looked at that's exactly what they've done that they've looked at children have seizures that look that you know cancer patients and palliative here and so I guess the up for New Zealand to also contribute some evidence and spite of the fate of people who are using it knowing it I guess makes it what's the right word I mean because one of the things we've been grappling with there's you know cannabis is a medicine and the verification and the processes you have to go through to verify there's a medicine folding GPS and clinicians to prescribe so your point is not lost on our committee yeah so any things you've actually brought up about the combination so yeah but very much appreciate your submission thank you very much for making me look I think I've just add that I'm probably being a bit narrow my focus because there is a lot of other people with other diseases which hours life-changing as my team uses and they also can be now we have to go back this meant hard in here thank you for making a submission thank you for letting me talk on it yep so first of all I'd like to say like Julian who before lunch that spoken who said machinee talking about the prohibition and how it just all started it doesn't really make sense it's kind of an outdated law and it's year like 40 years old I think he said him yes I think that needs to be chipped into perspective when I'm ending this one and it's being mentioned most most submissions today but the terminally ill there's two smaller scope it needs to be on to the chronic um it was chronic pain and illnesses like a Miss the doctors education needs to I think that should be a focus in um some stage because I kind of feel like they're like although it is legal for them at the moment to prescribe the two skier to all these kind of peer pressure not to and um also the scope on just CBD I think is too small it needs like the entourage effect it's called with like CBD THC CBC and all the other different cannabinoids um I think there would be ashamed to miss out on the whole big scope of things when you yeah in terms of how to do it I think we don't need to recreate the will it's being just emulating the country's legislation who are already doing it I mean in u.s. the majority of states have legalized medical marijuana in 2016 so they must have gone through the same or similar process is New Zealand to pass there so just kind of see what they've done in yeah emulate that so what I think would be good for New Zealand is licensed growers to supply the domestic and international market so you'd see benefits for all New Zealanders from economic Irwin social point of view like I'm a regional development is a key agenda for this current government and I think that will be a huge way or opportunity to realize that and it also helps with regulation like at the moment people are having to use black market of the black market and so these things where you don't know where at how it was produced and there's no regulations on the procedures or anything like that yeah that's all I've got and if you've got any questions after this industrial hemp so that it was an you know medicine or focus on that one year but it is the same cannabis plant it's just an for the seed what leads you to applying and what the state price is like for the industrial him and years so I've always been quite interested in like ten of us as a whole because of the prohibition in the reasons why I see in the whole reform a madness kind of kind of seems a bit kind of propaganda berry so when I kind of came back onto the family farm I thought I'd you try give my foot in the door in try to grow some NC no yes it did go well with harvested it already so I extract or get the seed out of it and then sell the seeds of people that press it and that oil is just a seed oil yeah like flaxseed oil yeah so supplements I was quite independent of CBD or any medicinal no no it's different yeah there's a lot of confusion about it that's probably the most common question I'm asked it's got a really small amount so it has to be tested and it's got a people 0.35% yeah yeah you so - I'm initially in the application process the police had to come the local police had to come in see we're always going to grow it and make sure that it was out of sight of the road and things like that and you meet the requirements and then we know it was growing that they came in at another looking more out of curiosity than anything just to check it out in kind of see if it is the thing we should walk between other cannabis so I have to apply each year right thank you very much oh just make me know when he's here so that means we have Shona how we roll yeah yep well when you're ready to start your five minutes please okay well thank you for hearing my submission today in 2017 it was estimated by the Minister of Health that 24% of the adult population in New Zealand have a chronic or long-term illness this is about equates to about 1.1 million people and I'm one of these many of the chronic illnesses have constant pain as a symptom we live with pain all day every day and not just in the last year of our life pain is debilitating and unfair I take mid pation for my pain and then I take medication for the side-effects of my pain relief medication people like me ie those were the chronic or long-term condition are the thorns and the side of the healthcare system we are expensive immediately not that interesting prior to diagnosis our medical teams find us interesting and complex they challenged by their diagnostic process the thrill of the chase you might say but as soon as you get a chronic illness as diagnose the chase is over we are told in a very nice way to suck it up we can't do anything more for you here have a few pills along comes of medicine that is cheap plant-based been around for centuries and has few or no adverse side effects but it is denied to us because of politics pharmaceutical companies don't want us to have 8c says that relation to their profits policy and lawmakers don't have the guts or the skills to give us access there are two main excuses that they give when its effectiveness is not non the research has been done and two if you give it to some people the floodgates will open in response to little being known about its effectiveness you just have to go on the internet there is lots of researchers here some of it dodgy some of its good but you also see that well-respected organizations like amiss you and USA are promoting that they are putting on their website pieces of research supporting its use I also did a quick search on the mid-south website if you look at capex I know capex owner is a very commonly use medication for Amir if mid-face says and I quote although the exact mechanism of how capex on roofs on amis is unknown it is thought that capex owned dot dot so there are medications that they are using already for amis that they don't know the exact mechanism by which it works but they know it does so it's approved in response to opening the floodgates to improper or legal use this is what legislators and public servants are for research and writing comprehensive legislation we don't go around saying we're not going to give the unemployed benefit to people in need because some people might abuse the system so why should we have to pay for the fact that some people might abuse it so in summary what I'm requesting as one that medicinal cannabis is accessible to all those with the chronic illness at an affordable price for as long as the symptoms of the illness requires relief not just in the final year of life and secondly through that controls the put in place to ensure that any that cannabis available is tested and donkey and has documented THC and CBD ratios to be medicinally effective [Music] thank you for the taking the time to Wellington yes mr. homn you bet but no I don't need so we have your submission before us you will have five minutes to present to the committee it's your time if you want to take it all that fine yeah otherwise they may be questions yes okay um yes um I was diagnosed with neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer which has been to my liver in July 2012 my oncologist at the time said I had about three to six months to live this is a typical diagnosis for that type condition people in my situation don't survive this long fortunately I have thanks to an organic diet herbs in meditation and holistic approaches there was nothing they could do for me so I was left to figure it out myself and thanks to help I have figured it out myself on the whole um obviously I've taken a great interest in health and how to maintain health and this is where the cannabis issue came into my life but particularly this bill as it stands if it was enforced in 2012 I would have qualified under it because they said I'd die within 12 months clearly I'm not dead within 12 months I think the first point is the doctors do the best but human health being what it is is very a vague science at best and I think this bill limits the options available to us FSC is this within a 12-month window because I think I'm down to the question okay what if they live more than 12 months and they were prescribed medicinal cannabis does that say right it stops on a certain date and if it actually does work for you tough luck wait until you start dying again and then we'll give it to you again it's just crazy the doctors in the patients need to be able to sigh for themselves waters the best course of health care for them and this comes to medicinal cannabis products as well doctors in the patient should be free to decide what is the appropriate course of action for them the next situation the statutory defense as it's currently envisioned isn't wide enough I'm anything same with a terminal diagnosis situation I mean we know cannabis from research overseas is useful with things like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and so on I know people with Parkinson's they're not looking for a cure but because of cannabis they have a life but their muscles don't tighten up they can live a self-sufficient normal life they stopped taking the cannabis they get bedridden they won't save their life but they'll give them a quality of life but much longer than they would otherwise not everybody has this effect of course I know people in the cancer community of those who've had murex effects from cannabis those who have had a much better and longer quality of life thanks to it and those for which has done nothing whatsoever so this is a spectrum of of the effects cannabis does have for people but it should be up to the people decide and their doctors what is best for them trying to survive cancer on your own is a very expensive business without support from the healthcare system doing it all natural methods as such I believe it should really you really really should be able to grow it ourselves if we need to get a license from prescription from the doctors in so be it and I'd hope they'd be able to prescribe seeds which have the rights THC the CBD ratio into it beans as well so if you're getting the right plant for your right condition and they'll be able to adjust it and so on stuff like that um and this would help keep the cost down cannabis oil and CBD this I was fortunate last year I went to Europe and I was walking past the health food store and burn and Switzerland and there's a whole range of CBD products anybody in the street could walk in and buy this here is a hemp cream contains CBD or was it just the packet I probably were been arrested if I brought into the country even though I couldn't get stoned on or anything like that but like any audience whistling just gone buy any type of CBD product tourists included same again in Denmark I found this as just waxed and I didn't go to look at this but this is what I found there's another one this is from mum as you'll see in my submission just from a hemp crop it's only a few years ago they figured out they would mainly grew up for seed and oil and stuff but then they figured out the leaves the leaves actually contain CBD and so they made it get it extracted and make it into the paste which people can take for their health conditions and anybody can buy off the shelf online whatever and it as it stands in this bill at the moment it's just talked about opening it up by description well when clearly there's restrictions all around the world which are opening it up freely for people to buy as they see the need for it and I think that's that's very important that we have the right to do that and in terms of the domestic market I think the bill isn't particularly clear around what's going to what the framework is going to be in terms of growing and how you can process it and sell it and all the rest but need to be very clear about the regulatory framework you're coming up with because there is there is an arms race on at the moment and the cannabis field in case you may have noticed and there's billions tens of billions at stake and we're behind the eight ball right now we really need to get into it and this will help with the quality quantity in the price of the products we eventually give so in conclusion this bill needs to change in line with my submission and others to reflect the healthcare interests of people who need the healing powers of cannabis at a reasonable price that is affordable to the average person yes yeah yeah others just the cream one I got excellent I found it very useful they also brought some droppers as well as a liquid where this was more of a paste in a tube type thing yes just ate the paste is sort of a waxy oily sort of thick paste from the CBD you can further refine it but that was I think then I just been going a couple of years with us I figured out in Denmark that's in Swiss on PhD is illegal but unlike New Zealand they didn't make CBB illegal so that this market is sprung up accidentally is evidence has come under the head of positive health benefits for people in the demanders ESO yeah yep yes no yeah it's a terrible disease unfortunately normally so I'm glad I could be here to submission details on your time it's your time see here Motorola my name is Ezra stabat and I work in suicide prevention these will help I've been doing this six years throughout my time thing and means will help I have come across many different people with many different issues for me cannabis is one of the things that will heal our country and we've got to stand up and we've got to make this thing to say yes we can we have amazing kind of conditions that would produce the peace in the world I'm not that we should that we should be accepting cannabis as a home but more than we should be accepting CBD for its the THC inside of the cannabis that is the addictive mentality I was there watching my mum who used eighty-two prisons in cannabis at the same time and the adverse effects of her bipolar was skyrocketing her mood swings were higher than normal when she was just on cannabis alone I stand here for the simple reason of I know people are out there that are hurting in silence we've got ex-cops that will not touch the stuff but are suffering in pain because the stuff is not legal and they will not touch it until it is legal this is the stuff that can heal this is the stuff that does heal we see it at roots so what are we waiting for why are we standing around what that hands in our pockets because generations of force in cannabis is a big no-no you know you're a pot here whatever hoc Heather's as a simple term of being happy that's what I believe anyway and in the words of patch Adams we should be increasing the quality of life with our patients who are suffering we're talking about Ms we're talking about mental health issues we're talking about anything we have the capability of healing so many different so many different things that are out there you look at someone with anorexia now when we here in cannabis the first thing that options we're given luxuries or for me that's one of us that would stop the mind frame or I haven't done much research and to that side of it sort of things but the things that we can do to in a for our people as simple that's making this stuff legal I as I said before I reckon means we'll health in I also focused on Renoir and Norman what is multi medicine and I particularly love making pani poni and panty panty is extremely healing we use color color leaves and honey and everything out there and if we could only put CBD in there for a cancer patient that can't smoke it they can't eat they can't do any of it or we can put it inside of the pony pony rubber on their belly belly button and we see the effects happen within moments we've seen we've seen videos across the world of people that are having epileptic fits like you see it right in front of you they take this stuff everything subsides everything goes away I do understand that there are that there are dangerous if it's cannabis Ben you can use it for too long or you're using it in the wrong dosage but we really shouldn't be looking at there and I and I and I and I also understand that some people that take it Heather everything's up in the fit a friend in front of me had an effect that I've never seen before from any of my friends to the few cinemas where he turns why he became breathless and I was interested so I don't know but I believe that we have the power and capability of creating strains that no one else in world would be able to do we hit the best conditions we have the best resources in this as my friend Steve just before we have been the leaders and will change come on the first people for the right to vote you know you've got the electric fence you've got the washing machine you've got all these amazing things Kiwi ingenuity this right here it's right now and we've got it so what are we waiting for way while we standing here having this hui hui hui hui hui and nothing's happening we also need to decriminalize this because people are getting locked up but healing themselves just going to commend you it's nice to young people come and present and in your own way so I'm glad that you felt comfortable to do that and I think what you've highlighted is but like we've had arguments today about alcohol and tobacco and it's actually not the alcohol the tobacco or the cannabis itself it's the types and how we use it and what we use it for like what's the purpose so appreciate you're making a submission thank you very much it's right here ray welcome to the Health Committee absolutely so we have your written permission yes and you do have five minutes it's your time yes so okay first of all I'll start by saying why did I write the report three years ago I have been suffering from from diabetes since 2002 I've also got a vision impairment which is a blindness and this was about in 2015 Rugby World Cup that's what I look like okay I have seen he lose a bit and obviously I have my diabetes under control these are the tablets that I take and there's 20 cabinets in total 15 in the morning five in the evening I also inject myself with insulin right and I had no control at all of my diabetes it had come to a point where if I had continued I would have got gangrene in my foot lost my foot and subsequently died and yet because of the tablets I was able to curtail this in 2015 I went to the states and a friend of mine suggested why don't I try cannabis and so I registered myself and what my this is called medical marijuana card and I was able to purchase cannabis from a dispensary and they had all forms this is why I'm saying and that is medical cannabis I mean at the end of the day you can go to a dispensary you can tell them what your ailments are they will suggest what strains are good for you you select the strains that that would you would need you can then bring it home and you can smoke it and and I'm telling you within weeks I had a total transformation of my diabetes I'll tell you there was a point where I had a problem going to the toilet I was constipated and everything else comes six o'clock in the evening my ankles swell up and I have to go to the toilet but I can stand there and strain and strain and strain and nothing happens at all but since taking this I have had really thirsty in the morning I go to the toilet that's it dumped and then right throughout the evening I have no issues at all with so I know my metabolism is all working and the only way it is working is because of the cannabis so there may be other people like me who approval or and there may be some people who it won't work for but the only way to do it is to train our medical practitioners to understand that we do have an endocannabinoid system in our bodies and that is the important thing and that's years before we can come to that stage but in the meanwhile I suggest that canvas is legalized so that everybody can use it if you say if I guarantee you it's their right to to actually died of overdose you have to consume about 30 yea tons of cannabis to actually sort of kill you the other thing I have an issue with is the the CBD okay CBD is wonderful okay the US government has a patent on CBD and they say it's antioxidant and a neuro protectant a neural protectant means that if there's some harm coming into your brain and you take cannabis it actually protects you because of the CBD now it does the same thing with THC so you take THC and it takes you to a high it gives you a Korea it it causes a little bit of a situation where you you're not you're not in control okay but it doesn't take you to the limit it doesn't take you to the point where you will die because CBD comes in half way through and it suspends the THC and and it supports you from prolonging the treatment and that's why I'm saying it is safe twelve thousand years it has been associated with humankind in one way or the other as as many seen as as obviously as impairs the fiber and the medicinal aspects go back to two thousand two thousand two thousand seven hundred thirty-seven BC so that's about like five thousand years ago and it's recorded in in in a Chinese document that cannabis was in use for medicinal purposes so it has been around for that many years but yeah in in in just a fraction of the last seven years we we have abolished opportunity to use this drug as as something that supports you that something that prevents you because it is something that okay the word is homeostasis homeostasis is a balance in the body and what it does is it brings upon this balance in the body which helps you to overcome all the illnesses and side-effects and stuff like that right now to conclude I would like my friend to read just two minutes if won't even take two minutes I'm sorry but if I give you more time your others here and we're trying to be you've seen how we well good afternoon and thank you for your time my name is Anna and I support this bill but I don't think it goes far enough to help people like my dad who suffers from Parkinson's disease and chronic pain in 2007 my father was struck by a severe case of shingles which Britain sudenly leading to meningitis and careful itis in a mini-stroke it was the first of several majors knocks on his health it was heartbreaking and gut-wrenching for our family to live through and at four stared into early retirement in the start of living daily life that ongoing chronic pain poorly managed by prescription medication in 2016 ded was diagnosed with Parkinson's an illness that affects this mental and physical well-being on a daily basis this world begins to get smaller as the power concerns disease the neurological pain and the side effects of the daily means to take their toll he had been managing herself pretty well until February when he fell very sick rapidly leading to a criticals case of sepsis and pneumonia he came pretty close to the edge but mercifully he had the inner strength to fight it go dead he was in hospital for two weeks we calculated that he was prescribed over 250 oral in IV medications a drug cocktail that severely affected his Parkinson's and a major medical event that he is still in remission from and a few weeks we'll go back into surgery with the risk of the infection reoccurring he's already proven he has the strength to tackle this they stay strong did I love you dad has never been one to drink much has never taken recreational drugs and has never broken the law whilst he understands the benefits that prescribed means he can't stand the chemical haze and what he calls the brain fog and the other disruptive side effects that this medication brings with minimal effect on managing his pain or his Parkinson's often he refuses the meds just and suffers the pain to feel present in desperate times dad is often thought about obtaining cannabis via the black-market to treat his condition that stops short of doing so as there is no certainty of dosage and he wants the medical treatment not the high the unregulated cannabis would bring my fear is there as the parkinson's progresses he'll be forced into more of this medication that brings more damaging side effects continuing to reduce his quality of life yet at the same time there exists peer-reviewed evidence-based studies that have proven medical cannabis can be beneficial to manage my dad's range of health conditions which makes me realize that we are no longer faced with a lack of evidence but merely a lack of education to DES to the medicinal benefits of cannabis how is the progressive society do we ask people like my dad to choose between his health and the more that he and my family would need to risk the legal prosecution to excess whole of plant treatments especially since there has been a significant shift in the global public mindset for marijuana is a gateway drug to marijuana medicine and it's one of the fastest-growing global economies as more societies embrace and access the medically proven benefits of cannabis and business continues to develop quality innovative medical products to meet this growing demand we have a massive opportunity as we transition from a black market the only place currently affordable and available to those who need it into an established and regulated industry that provides a wide range of whole of plant-based medical products the treat of vast array of chronic illnesses an industry where we can leverage our proven excellence in agriculture entrepreneurship and innovation to create a new economy centered on social natural and human well-being because for many New Zealanders medical cannabis can and does provide them with the ability to leave manageable fulfilling lives but with this bill my father would have to currently risk prosecution to use this medication and for the awful reason that he isn't terminal my father and others require legal access to whole of plant medical cannabis not just CBD and we need to build a regulated domestic industry that championed entrepreneurship innovation and social well-being to produce effective quality medical cannabis products of a standard that New Zealand is globally renowned for the world is ready for it and they're already doing it New Zealand is primed to become a leader in it and I want my dad to stick around he would like access and but he has a lot of brain fog from the opioids that he at times refuses to take he doesn't want to get high so he and because he has the range of health conditions in Parkinson's they're still in its very early stages of a medical cannabis treatment he wants to know with certainty that he's getting you know whole of plants specific dosage treatment to get him off the opioids at regime 2 then enable these products to be available yes I think that the main concerns I have is that I don't I don't think it should be about to illness I think it should be about people's ability to to live manageable and fulfilling lives with chronic illness and pain I think that that people should be able to grow their own medication but to specific regulatory standards and I just I just want my dead I just don't I've had to spend many nights in hospital watching them come close to death and wake up in the morning to take very very heavy hitting pharmaceuticals and still be in chronic pain and and I want to provide him with an alternative it's too expensive and because he has neurological pain he has such a wide range of conditions we imagined that it would take you know that the right medication from the rightly educated doctor to give him the right dosage requirements to meant you know Parkinson's versus neurological pain quite different illnesses the regulatory regime being able to be originated grow your own specific products although it's out of scope for people to be able to grow their own within our bill because we've become once already had the baby and we voted it down I can't see why that can't be part of a regulatory framework I would absolutely support their ears yeah yeah but the other thing is you realize that the exemption is just the prosecution so once the regime's in place it will be available to everybody who needs it based on the adopters prescribing it for them [Music] [Music] more evidence thank you so the next what have we got one two three four five six missions or markers after yep so we've now got Tracy [Music] [Laughter] does that mean you're trying to bring I'm here is going on here sorry I said that if I if I couldn't come because Grace's health then I'd let you guys know thank you good afternoon thank you for the opportunity to come and speak to you today my name is Tracy and my daughter Grace has been prescribed medical cannabis since November 2015 as you'll be aware from my submission grace his a severe chronic condition as a result of nikka vallarta or an information of her brain when she was 10 she's just celebrated her 16th birthday and March which means that she has injured nearly 6 years of what can only be described as a living hell excuse me um since beginning medical cannabis in 2015 grace has experienced great improvements and her motor skills who epilepsy in who dystonia three months left beginning medical cannabis you're against your ability to speak in Grace has been cannabis has become a really valuable tool alongside her other treatments some medications we've been able to wean away completely and other medications we've been able to reduce as far as the regulatory framework has concerned me Tabuk medical cannabis and New Zealand needs to be affordable I've been told by graces specialists that thermic will not be subsidizing these medications she has been prescribed two different products one as set of the X which has taken as an oral spray and that costs us at even hundred dollars for three bottles which depending on the dosage that she needs in lasts anywhere from four to six weeks lately she has been using touré oil which has also taken orally and there is at a cost of nine hundred and two dollars for three bottles which at her current dosage lasts us twenty five days unfortunately the moment to dose is presently higher as here three monthly Botox injections that she needs and who Nick her back her arms who leagues if thumbs are three months late so at the moment she's in a great deal of distress and very stuff him so I had to go up on the medication we're only able to afford the medication due to the generosity of the public I have had to leave my job as a registered nurse when grace became ill in 2012 to become her full-time carer and now I am a single parent so I'm on a supported living benefit as Grace's Kiera so the cost of these products is prohibitive and we're just very lucky that we have been given money free fundraising in literally some temporary additional support from one's has helped towards the cost I have to reapply for that every three months which is quite stressful you're always thinking about how much money have I got left I mean if we'd tried it for grace and it hadn't worked that would be fine but it has worked and it's been incredible and it's not something I can deny here so for us it's important that it's made affordable um alternatively making your own medicine until New Zealand has an affordable medicinal kind of a scheme in place you know realistically that's possibly I don't know two three years away I don't know but until that happens we need to be able to have that viable option but I also think to be confident in the end product we need to be in control of the entire process I don't think it's feasible to go in buy some raw product from someone on the street you need to be in control of the entire process from choosing the strain of plant that you want to grow to be able to grow it organically pesticide-free disease-free and then to continue on and do the extraction via suitable method which brings the my second point in regard to the regulatory framework and that is that grace needs access to a variety of medical products in order to address his specific symptoms what she has prescribed as a one-to-one ratio THD to CBD a set of X into rate oil are both the same much has been said about CBD only medication but medical cannabis is not necessarily a one-size-fits-all medicine grace needs the THC as well as as well to effectively calm her spasms and give her relief from her pain there are numerous strains providing varying ratios of cannabinoids and terpenoids and studies are showing the merits of whole plant therapy rather than isolated extracts you know those studies are coming through the entourage effect they call it because grace ingests in medicine it takes some time to take effect and in times of distress for dystonic storms or prolonged clusters of seizures I do have to resort to a sedative drugs - just to knock her out the Razr p.m. in clonidine just make a good asleep get it asleep for a few years but I know that there are high THC nasal sprays available in the states that are amazingly effective in most circumstances my final point in regard to the statutory defense is that that will be grudged to the term lleol is that my daughter's classified as palliative but she isn't at this point dying and to make the projection that she will die over than the next 12 months is impossible I would like therefore to see those with debilitating in severe health conditions to be included and that they would also that would also extend to carers in family that might need to provide medication for them there also needs to be a provision made for patients to grow the plants they need or to nominate a grower if they are unable to do so themselves realistically you know as I said before a local New Zealand scheme will still be a years away and in the meantime patients need to be able to medicate safely that's fun able to pay for the prohibitively expensive imported products so yeah again I thank you for the opportunity to come and speak to you today highlighted the palliative I mean we focused on terminal but negatively I think palliative has got a particular connotation about you know finishing people kind of an state a stage of chronic condition yes so so what can you just talk me through this mission and how she will not get better um here her seat of symptoms with they damage to her basal ganglia means that she suffers severe dystonia which is contorting her body she has been a very very extreme case and as I mentioned and my submission she's had numerous interventions for that she's had deep brain stimulation she's got an unethical baclofen pump running which we have been able to reduce the dose of since using cannabis products but she won't get better so it's more about quality of life in controlling her symptoms she has a very severe BEC curvature scoliosis which the force of the spasms is just dragging her more and more out of position in that as an operable so long term medicinal cannabis is going to be very important in providing you with pain relief to enable her to sit in who cheer for a period of time to enable her to sit in the chair long enough to go in the van and go for a drive or go to school for the three hours that she can manage so we need to if we were to look at also communicates I think here in need I think in Grace's case she's suffering she suffers um who suffering is indefinite there's not an e in it in its line I could be tomorrow because she is fragile but at this point in time it that's indefinite and she will always have it thank you I'm just making sure Kingsley's not here so trying to go to the next one you you're no Josefina idiot slowest of all speaking your - Josephine we're just gonna turn you up a bit can you hear me okay yep come here here Lee I can so before you begin and we give you your five minutes there's a couple of colleagues in the room who are going to introduce themselves hi right hi I'm Nikki Wagner in people Christchurch Yoda Josephine so you we have that a five-minute submission from you it's your time so either you deal with it as you choose so if there are any questions you'd like us to answer please save a little time at the end but I get it ready to go thanks why today there's no much more to say is there both of us things did they know I shouldn't just be Fatima no it should be for chronic and debilitating is spell remove universe in him bombs misuse of Drugs Act with all the money that's been spent on these we could have set up our own medicinal cannabis program you know the people who are using it and don't stop cuz it's working it amazes me here many politicians can sleep at night knowing that one thick can change people's life I've got a question about cuz you're right the exemption regarding prosecution is only for people with the terminal condition I guess our challenge as if you make it too broad being essentially anybody can use it free from prosecution I know people have been talking about chronic and debilitating but as their I mean we just I think I feel Majed a condition for something like three or four years recurring be considered on it and debilitating means if you can't get around if your quality of life as in in a debilitating rice bowl I don't know but that makes sense to me yeah it's a long-term medical you know you can't just over your doctorate they are there has to be better there's big proof miracles and most of the people I believe who has made submissions has got this over 13 years long you know two years ago my oldest brother diagnosed insulin given six months but he died in January this year we're all terminal well I think it was a very straightforward submission I like this is a challenge for us just to get on and do something it's quickly and thank you very much these change for what I think the rollers when I'm Sophia I don't know why but I don't enjoy the rest of your day every eight okay well we'll move on from tourism yeah you you're not Victoria it's the list of all speaking can you hear me yes I can Oh oh there we go that's much better for us as can you hear so just before you start shall we give you five minutes for your submission just allow my colleagues to introduce themselves thank you so much right right so we're in your hands Thank You Victoria okay do I only have two people on the floor committee it's me no sir I'm in the wood for the chair okay thank you so much sorry for the brief nature of my submission to you but I was having two to two problems and I was only able to show that in at the last minute first of all I'd like to say that as a great power member I strongly support the ultimate Tia gray power branch who has submitted to earlier and is asking our government to read legalize the cannabis plant for our health health benefits allowing us to have a choice between the prohibitively expensive and potentially during dangerous pharmaceuticals and that in the plant that has been used for centuries with what one not one single death by overdose I am a victim of the war on drugs we are all victims of the propaganda that we have been fed over the decades when the incredibly misguided war on drugs was imposed upon us I myself was dragged through the courts as the 60 plus year olds women never having stepped outside the law before I was growing cannabis for my husband because he lost his legs in a medical misadventure cannabis proved to be the only effective drugging completely stopping the excruciating phantom pain that he had spent other people with limb and amputations experience and like Helen Kelly he said that that he said that you Cannabis allows me to continue to function and that was the beauty of that compared to this very strong and addictive opiates that he was offered when your young ones your grandchildren children friends are out there in the real world when they grow up it is perhaps not eve to think that they will not be offered some kind of drugs at some stage right now in this country people are being offered a drug that they call synthetic cannabis which has nothing to do at sea anibus it is a vegetable matter sprayed with chemicals some of which have killed almost 20 New Zealanders last year the unintended consequences of cannabis prohibition is resulting of higher youth and extremely dangerous drugs like pee please don't believe me I will now quote dr. Graham Gulbis Debrecen who recently received an award and he was picked up in the New Zealand doctor magazine and he says that quote prohibition of cannabis has driven people to use dangerous alternatives like synthetic cannabis with deadly results cannabis is right down there at the low end of the harm spectrum a 68 year old woman patient tells me I go to my penny shop to buy cannabis but the last few visits all they had was a white powder if there is a proper provision of recreational cannabis where people knew what they were getting and could buy they arrest likely to get these other dangerous substances you have all asked and I think Nicky you have asked for more evidence of efficacy you can be very comfortable in noting that dr. Anthony Faulk Ross who is a renowned New Zealand oncologist says that between 40 and 50 percent of all New Zealand cancer patients are already self-administering with cannabis because it works and why else would they risk incriminating themselves and family members yes it did work also a new study that came out was written up in drugs and alcohol today it was research from the UK Ireland in bed mark it looked at the research on team was made up of seven researchers and they looked at 4700 Danish 24 year olds they found that cannabis use on its own did not cause psychosis and that the one quote that is commonly used comes from research that did not look at other causes of psychosis and impaired brain development like over use of other drugs such as alcohol pharmaceuticals traumatic events or what five percent of all new zealand children are suffering from and that is alcohol fetal syndrome so to use that as an excuse not to realize this plant is was not valid also research because it worked for my husband with his his limp leg pain he has phantom pain is because cannabis is a neural protector there is why it is also effective for people who have who suffer from seizures that's why it's also effective for people who have glaucoma I have two front pages of my local newspaper here one first alcohol big problem in edy the other one says meth-fueled violence hits nightlife these you will never see an article like that on cannabis it is not a dangerous drug it is very low on the hoenn spectrum and former police chief both in America and last week in in Australia Bob Karen Jeff Kenneth came out and said that cannabis should be treated as a health issue not a criminal issue they are not alone in saying this Greg I'm sorry um James Gray from the United States judge of Superior Court and and I quote I believe that cannabis prohibition is the biggest failed policy in our country's history second only to slavery now any question me please challenge me I'm here let's got a question for you I was brought through the courts and I was accused of supplying cannabis I did supply cannabis to my husband because I not watch him go through that kind of thing and he have no other alternative and I put to you that you would do the same and I did not get convicted because the judge and the courts of this country are starting to see that sending people to prison for helping other people who are sick and don't want to be subjected to dangerous pharmaceutical should not be a crime thank you so much for listening to me and other people or any answer you know Ashley its lowest of all the chair of the Health Select Committee are you there hello Ashley yep are you here yes I can hear you aqueous oh you bet I'd be a little bit oh okay so before we proceed Ashley I have two colleagues in the room they'll introduce themselves and then we'll ask you to present your submission you have five minutes thank you very much thank you thank you well firstly we thank you for giving me another step to knee and platform to address this issue of basically treating good honest people who generally give back more to society than either Kate categorized groups of people who say wrinkled these are drugs reasons and this is a national day that helps so many people will have the room people dealing with cancer diseases Alzheimer's arthritis never listed English depression PTSD and in those first ones the various countries it is legal you are not regarded as a criminal if you use cannabis and get relief from your symptoms you know the illogical law stating if someone is missing 12 months ago things do seem to use cannabis so easily of the cosmic better taste in my mouth and I'm sure many others have the M you know something okay Addison thinking where's the logic in that I will tell you a bit about myself suffer terrible seizures from a bad decompression saturation diving in the women s industry the decompression in turn meters and unfortunately you know a stack of bubbling my brand of course became terrible seizures and I lost everything I lost was my Lafayette which was very gray my family loved and in store to this data and my self-respect my belief in myself or my ability I was having epileptic seizures they were following the same pattern of sex relation thousands every three or four weeks of having these terrible season when I was living in PA at the time when I picked up my expect office and most people knew when I was having my seizures because the respective will be arriving and oh my god Samuel talking to the hospital and put me into camera in these comments and sanitizer be in this camera and you never I first started online by the lady runs the the chem crack well is very sweet Kamala stone when Sam was pretty much limited and then I come out of the seizures anything that people around there seem to recognize no matter the water one or two times but now where I'm at what's going on it's quite quite freaky and the same is nothing from 2013 every month so gene was yeah McCutchen is colonized when the relatives as well he's one of the top neurologists in you know every can prescribe anything but they just feeling around same with ear mmm a lot of the opinions are changing as well slowly but fly sort of suffering their agency - keep doing what you're doing Khan telling what what you shouldn't do but you're not having seized anymore and so just keep doing what you did and so it's very nice to come I rediscovered I can eat all the noisiest I've used some cannabis with special color and it actually expects who the cannabis artisan into a bag that's one of any recognized been true cannabis the horizon and said aware that we eat a bit not people my mouth even looks easy on the ground at one time I xx you thought of a bag and squirt it in my mouth and a case straight out of season sun cooking normally okay omona system I said I don't understand why speaker I don't have you treated anymore but our corn stop what because it is helping me and my seizures Thomas yeah coming up my life is coming back I can work again I can contribute to society in it's been a long time and I just got tired of being regarded as a criminal I'm sure other people now Jane must know somebody because some trains in family that he's using cannabis who pays for my testicle cancer and these why is machine is good instantaneous relief is fish hello been put inside the machine within a few seconds work talking from seizing so um you know like I said I would just like this to be pushed forward and these people to listen to listen and hear our plea because there's some really good people out in society that she's not be regarded as criminal anymore then I'm saving my love him and I'm a non-rpg I don't really know what I say besides thank you for being us perform at least to you at least an issue and hopefully this can be can be addressed sooner rather than later unlike ourselves gonna continue doing what I was doing to keep myself alive and keep keep motivated so thanks again and can I say thank you Ashley for choosing to engage in a process where you know there is a some vulnerability and some of what you've shared but I actually think as understanding the relevance of this piece of legislation and the relevance of cannabis to people's lives is really important because we understand who this bill is trying to help and I think it will help us making a much more effective piece of legislation well that's the aim of our silly committee process anyway and we can't do that without the people the public and putting so thank you very much and enjoy the rest of your your day yes so do you all up there and say thanks again obviously speak soon sometime with it but everything's changed and then we have mark a smack in the roof yeah mark you'll be up after Kelly so yeah I'm sorry Joshua got a Kelly it's mr. wolf speaking there chair of the Health Committee can you hear me oh it's lovely now before we end over to you and give you five minutes for your submission I have two colleagues who want to introduce themselves hi good afternoon you all afternoon so we're in your hands Thank You Kelly we're on the loudspeaker are we yes you hear me here is a lot of these a roomful of people so a lot of interest in this bill today you will expense the reason that would be because as a country we're a long way behind I believe did you submit either anyone I imagined someone read my letter detailing my history Malone said of an expat so the priest is pretty substantial with some of the submissions alone I imagined little own than the documented history sort of pretty much worldwide now that is far as medicinal use or ethnicity it's really well over drew and if anything really I'd like to take a little bit of time to talk about the real decriminalization of this substance if it really is time for change if surely there's expect that don't come home because they're not going to have the same security meet if they leave with our and even that isn't jeopardy nowadays as the lights are flickering you've proven with the demand for a high-value product it's really a bit of a no-brainer that's an industrial science and industrial what niche market that Heather country were quite capable of filling it grows like a weed life is meant to we don't have to try and add value to it it's already valued for our system time on the land and everyone's always talked about in Delhi to the product and here's an opportunity let's not let it slide boy like the seventies with the opiates that landed in Tasmania they provide a third of the world's income it's really a no-brainer so let's talk about decriminalization and getting some guidelines then take the take the industrial advantage the employment the revenue and use it to fight some of our real problems and issues and our ever-growing country and little yeah little regional little farmers little land owners get something of real value out of it I'm quite prepared before my hands up through a land court operation and help out it as goodies we want to refine the billion trees will lease replant a billion implants or whatever the proper strange need to be to make it value for all of us not just medicinally but as a country on a decent survey I imagine in an employer or seen firsthand it's it's running freely here anyway if you're over 21 why not be a layout it so brain finish developing make your own decision so you know Kelly that as part of the government formation the Greens have managed to have agreement that there will be a referendum about decriminalization in this parliamentary term so presumably at the next election but I think what we've been hearing stories about today is very much about how canvas has been amazing and alleviating symptoms in people managing pain for a number of conditions or in reasons absolutely I agree the lights events please yeah neck pain let alone the people that are only living prism I'm a little upset I couldn't be to you today and produce the paperwork that showed you know a grade three tumor that are basically being proved by me prior to anything else I went through yeah so no brainer well that's wonderful any questions [Laughter] darn it does cook sorry what State Forestry and be proud of them timber consider the junk that we're trying to sell on our domestic market it's just wobbly genetically modified timber it's not acceptable bro what we used to grow really quality timber all our builders across the country will absolutely agree that had enough of the shortywood so least effective you're in a corporate thank you Kelly it's really helpful appreciate your input Kelly enjoy the rest of your day well I have a little bit of much it that feels yeah the motor that is change wonderful we liked it okay khaki please boki good day to you all now we hit Mack have instead as your time thank you much oh when you're ready I'll begin your time thank you very much so thank you for the opportunity to speak to the committee I'd also just like to take a moment to think in Cannes I wouldn't be here today and the hope wasn't for your support they are a great organization and I would love to see the government acknowledged there as you know from my submission I'm a medicinal cannabis user I'm okay with saying that I've come to terms with it no no I have Crohn's disease and further to that my mum has multiple sclerosis which makes this whole issue she couldn't be here today in part because the finding is obviously so as I said before it may not seem like it but a couple of years ago um I was a bedridden priest me said about six kilos due to a horrible condition I will have for the rest of my life and the meat that came along with it what is unbearable side effects for me and that actually outlined I think in the submission it was a bit the cotton paper I cut a nice job from about six different drops didn't it um but is a thigh friend hydrocortisone cream the zone of codeine and morphine through middle cycling or Tripoli climb and some others that I either care not remember the name of almond genuinely just can't those are all medications that I had to take I don't take any of those communications I haven't done for about four and a half months now I've also been in remission for three and a half months for the first time since my diagnosis okay you can draw your own conclusion as to why this but I sit before you today relatively fit because I'm quite lazy but definitely help me like I said I don't have to take those medications anymore I did that very sensibly I consulted with my GP throughout the whole process I made in very aware of what I wanted to do and how I wanted to do it and I was very very fortunate in there I just so happened to have a GP who was particularly supportive of that I obviously couldn't do too much on a professional level but he certainly gave me the space to make the decisions that I wanted to make which I felt I was merely given and the two and a half years prior that I had involvement and the help system I like to think that some extent that I'm a living proof of how cannabis can be beneficial to people if you take the time to learn about it and you use it consistently and you use the right products and you use it to safely as soon as possible under encouraged especially it can be incredibly rewarding I go as far as to say in my submission that I genuinely hand on heart believe their cannabis saved my life I was going through huge issues with all the opiate medications that I was on to a point where one day I came home from work and I just broke down into an excellent heap on the floor and I pulled my eyes out like a five-year-old wheel for about an hour and I said to my wife I just couldn't do it anymore and I asked her to take all of the medication out of the house because if it was lengthier obvious I was going to take a lot more than I should she lovingly of course she did that which was the best thing since then I started used canvas consistently and and that's how we ended up where we are I find me personally intervals aren't overly practical I know some people regarding with Crohn's are spoken to the house elite completely separate if you already know that I know young child so we'll keep those very separate but you will have a bit of an understanding of what people as crimes go through on a daily basis for example I can now go to a supermarket that [ __ ] himself I'm to be French and I get to live a life of dignity this law allows people to die with dignity but it doesn't allow living people in the same respect that's my only real question to the Select Committee if I'm really honest is why is it this I appreciate it wasn't either two of you individuals but why is it that this legislation is written in such way that it means that people can't live with dignity they can only die with it and in such a way that it means that like I said my submission you expect terminally ill patients to go to Kenny houses for what they believe is medicine and you'll also expect me to sit there and watch my own mother deteriorate in health to a level where somebody is willing to give their at least that to say how you're about to die now you can have some relief that's not the way that it's written it's actually just a dispensation from being prosecuted yeah it's a compassion so it's not you're not saying it's okay you just say we're not in jail and and I think the argument is that until people feel confident that they can have a product that's safe that when people know that they're to reveal though perhaps would take more risk there brings me back to the submission as well and once I mention that I think people should have the right to grow their own medicine at home you can do that safely and that is just that you can no one has ever died from cannabis you know and I think that's we we've got I'm not sure if you're aware that because in this parliamentary tuned and Parliament has considered a bill let propose for people to grow their own yeah I mean we first parliamentary term we know that we've had the close corporate bill that is loaded down we hear the government build it with yeah voted for which is why we're here and then at the end of this term possibly at the next election there will be a referendum about decriminalization yeah I think what a lot of binding referring is no well nobody unless they go through a process like we did failure but we could have a referring them and absolutely nothing could happen as a result yeah so yeah that's right yeah but I just wanna but what a lot of people have highlighted and what you've particularly highlighted see once we create the regulatory regime and it is deemed a medicine yeah cannabis I can't see why that regime couldn't prescribe seeds for people specific seeds based on you know it our full knowledge of what's in them yeah so so so trust us we are taking this role incredibly seriously but there are constraints on what this committee can encounter and we're just trying to be as transparent as possible with people but I don't believe one moment that I think very very it's necessary for the taxpayer to be fishing out thousands of dollars to subsidize miscommunication or the people to be paying six hundred fifteen hundred dollars a month for this medication the reality is they can grow product in their back garden and somewhere in the lucky if that is in some cases going to be superior to their and and I personally I believe with this is the beginning beginning of us being on the pathway to do it it's just navigating away from the historical reality that cannabis is illegal yeah and so what we're trying to do is to address all the issues that you and your colleagues have borne out so but yeah and I'm sorry about the time but we've just there's so many people wanting to speak to us that we've kind of restricted individual submissions to five minutes but all of the organizations that you're all parent of please be reassured they've all been given 15 minutes and when we see them as a full committee we have decided to break in here individual submissions as two subcommittees but it's actually about keeping this bill on track getting it back into the house so that that will be passed this year one thing I'm the dust talking system about earlier that I just really want to make you guys are we're off which is a little bit of an understanding thing around crimes I'm in the way that a can or might not help um what cannabis because I I appreciate is not a lot of evidence out there rigidly related to crime is not and I see this reality it worked for me I'll say then yeah but I kept on a scientific level is very little we often talk about smoking and things like that but eatables you would have heard a lot about this stuff oils teas all of those sorts of things I just want to add for people with inflammatory bowel disease or me in particular I know speak for other people that it's not fair honestly the amount of information within myself varies significantly at any given time it could be quite severe - it's quite limited I've been very fortunate in the last four months that I think virtually none um but as a result of that if I'd consumed edibles in a time where I have a lot of information in my bell don't exhort them okay but if I exhort if I eat edibles if timeliness no information in my bow I exhort that entirely and do absolutely nothing what I'm saying is that there has been some talk about limiting the way that people consume cannabis but the point I'm trying to make is there some ways a bit of a summative or in other ways the planet for other people and I just think there's something we really need to give a little bit of understanding around because what works involved might not work for Josh thank you very much [Applause] welcome now I ever you have read my written submission right well I won't go through that again just for the record that is there's about me choosing to break the law to obtain the cannabis product for my friend who was dying and I wish to affirm I would do that again it's also about the risks and harms that were attached to the election because of the law as it stands only some of which would be eased by the bill at hand I'll jump through the conclusion of my submission I ask you to consider taking a realistic and compassionate view and do the following use the regulations that will be attached to this bill to make its gesture towards the terminally ill work in the real world by allowing them to nominate an approved supplier I think at the moment the bill simply will not do that purports to do because it leaves the legal risk surrounding everyone but the patient recognize that the term the ill I'm not the only New Zealanders derive benefit from cannabis products and allow others with chronic conditions to register they use those products provide specific protection for hospitals and hospices from prosecution under section 12 of the misuse of Drugs Act and I'm not sure with us this has come up in your proceedings section 12 is the offense of allowing apprentices to be used for the Commission of defense against the misuse of drugs and it may not may never happen but it is enough to prevent hospices from allowing cannabis products be used which is what happened in the case of my friend I don't think they were opposed to the use of cannabis per se they did not want to expose themselves to the legal risk and I really think this is something you have to look at in this bill there is a comparison there with pill testing festivals and made the major barrier there is there first of all understand organisers can't afford to put themselves at that legal risk I would also be keen to see you allow a local industry to develop by allowing export of locally produced products and by not excluding those with existing convicted convictions from participating in the industry as someone else mentioned Hitler Danny before I've heard I think what they want to do and what they're doing is is inspiring and I hope they can do it even though you've told me I'm not allowed to ask allow self-growing under regulation I would rather see their handled and the general cannabis reform but that seems a long way away so I would like that and also finally to enable research into growing and into clinical trials the trend and the developing global industry is overwhelmingly towards breeding clients with specific desired attributes and that's an area at much New Zealand has a really from history and I think that would apply here as well so I am asking you to regulate canvas differently to other potential medicines but maybe this is a bit easier because of those is already regulated very differently to other potential medicines its regulated differently to other control drugs under the misuse of Drugs Act it's much harder to prescribe and morphine or heroin or even cocaine so we are we have this situation I mean I understand the New Zealand Medical Association's position and clinical trials are important I have no quarrel with the pharmacist but it's a system geared towards delivering novel products to market and this is not what we're looking at with cannabis it's a very different challenge it's already in use very widely in many cases and this is the case with my friend before he died as well it's in use with the knowledge and approval of doctors there is a very different situation to say a new drug that has been developed and is someone's intellectual property and that's one of the reasons that you're not seeing a lot of products progressed through the phase three trials is because it's hard to own you know that the current system is geared towards developing intellectual property they are product trials of products and I think though there are various other reasons that you are going to I think Israel may actually crack it with research but at the moment most medical research is done in the US which currently makes it very difficult to conduct research into cannabis and also prohibits the use of modern strains and as I noted before this is the whole point of growing modern cannabis strains is for specific attributes so I think there's a real problem with research at the moment and I do understand what the doctors are saying but this is not a normal situation with a new product no I think really clear yeah oh good I'm glad yeah I mean I write about this stuff all the time and it's fascinating and it's it's nice to actually deliver so it'll be me juice thank you you can hear me just speak slightly lower I'm Juliette Makara mmm and I've traveled up from Christchurch mmm where I have a good friend and his fifties the stage for biotech nfler hmm he's been given three months to two years by the oncologist he's had seven months since diagnosis and he's still working full-time and the nursing profession this man needs help accessing cannabis and several circles of friends around him have become involved trying to help him um this is what he wants even though he hasn't been involved in recreational cannabis prior to his diagnosis in New Zealand doesn't have anything else to offer him beyond a small amount of chemo which he his head possibly in Australia he would get an amino therapy drug anyway cannabis has been really helpful for his sleep and for pain relief and he also hopes that if he can have it in high enough doses that he might slow the cancer down and have a bit more time with his family there are plenty of anecdotes to show you that this can happen a few cases so what has he got to lose the thing that's bothering him is that his friends are at risk of arrest um so this is very stressful for hominis friends it the people who help such patients should be commended not made criminals the most especially should not be made criminals when in the next few years this drug could well be legal or decriminalized in a compassionate system would allow growers to grow and processes to process medicine of any type that patients need from this plant and to other options are available for years to come I'd like to suggest that you somehow find a way to have some kind of moratorium on arresting those who supply patients with any illness that benefits from medical cannabis not just those with only one year left it's a time of transition I hope and so we have a Canadian or Israeli or Colorado stop in sit up picking out the best aspects of all those thank you of all those that have gone before and trying to avoid their worst mistakes at biggest belief that police energy should be wasted at this time of transition when real crimes with actual victims are being committed so please consider a moratorium on prosecution for that wider circle of helpers remember there are no victims so business does not have to be a crime thank you [Music] [Applause] we now is David here we have your submission it's very brief um okay um yeah I'm not very good at public speaking about here we go I'm here on behalf of all New Zealanders um the second annual healthy I haven't had time to be able to sit in here all day I don't know what's been said before but I'm listening to Russell with you pretty much the same is what I would like to say and then not just CBD needs to be looked at and regulated and approved at the whole I'm hope at all all okay number noise yeah I heard Nicki say something about the safety of cannabis and apparently nobody's died from taking cannabis themselves but there's only a few people I heard it was but more and that's only those people that are susceptible to it and if they choose to use it so really the number would be much lower but nobody's died from her and if you were to sit down and smoke it you need to have smoked 1,500 pounds of it in 15 minutes brought to be fatal now to put that in context on paracetamol and head over only needs 10 grams teen grams and this is available everywhere people shall be able to have access to um canvas and it doesn't need to be expensive you can give a seat 14 bucks chuck it on the ground and it will grow like a weed means somebody's medicine team bucks not three hundred and fifty dollars an ounce before I'm little whatever though I think it's 350 the government approved cannabis is gonna cost people that stuff from Canada yeah safe affordable medicine what the people want that's what the majority of people want and you are the people that can do it what's up to use and don't be lost down like the 2001 committee do you have um access to information yes I think the difference that we see today is we actually do have a bill so and it is a government bill with the support but it doesn't do much for the general public it's just for unlike chronically ill people on this door no so what's the regime is in place and will be able to be you know doctors will be able to prescribe it to anybody they feel will benefit from it the exemption and the law is only for those who have a terminal illness so there's a little bit of just a bit of a misunderstanding people think that it it's only people they can use cannabis what we've what we've seen is which has been tested today I must say is that we will exempt the law and say to our police officers don't prosecute people if they're terminally ill because in a couple years time when the regime that is really but isn't it at the discretion of the police can't they still prosecute they want to at the moment I have to say we've heard some pretty good arguments about it being broader and I think it needs to be because um the anti-inflammatory properties of cannabis are well documented we can look alone tonight yeah it's thousands of papers being written yeah I know this is all a very meaningful exercise come on hit my side Oh Jordan once pretty name put the magnet people here taranaki sure I'm Jordan reason I've come today is because cannabis helped me get out of a wheelchair in Arabic I'm Erin and so insisted I was born with fidelity Fairlane had cerebral palsy of a blackout since I was a teen I've had quite a numerous open-heart surgeries had eleven strokes I've learned how to walk talk and all that sort of stuff and in our 2016 a Canadian doctor Wellington Hospital and told me to try cannabis I hated it I grew up in body door and Kenneth Creek whereas all my friends suffer from no mental state of mind things because of they went to cannabis to other higher drugs and I was not having it and I was having quite a lot of seizures and I was on very high medication I was on fifty seven tablets a day my liver and all my organs was done in the shutdown and I went to natural medicine so I made all my approach to snuffle order to get all my muddy and here in the Wellington region and cap Tikus and belly and I I swear by the cannabis that they can help I've had back problems all my life because we know was eight I had to keep my achilles lengthened and they stretched the two Ferrand slept in the middle some three and a half inches sort on the right hand side which gives you a lot of big problems medication wasn't working anymore because I had been on them too far too long for the kid and the cannabis was natural I don't nobody has to say but um I've helped numerous things with II we settlements and I'm we're in both of those affair Taranaki ammonia at the moment and I know if I hadn't have been on cannabis I probably wouldn't have been here I've even tried missing suicide a couple of times but being undecided nope it's not the right thing to do and the Canadian doctor that was an Wellington's now gone back to Canada because there was too much heat on here if you saw a man a wee leader of that I'm lucky I can't see a problem with having medical cannabis allowed but the criteria is not good enough for people's like me very young can do things if I hadn't I tried cannabis I probably would still be on all those medications I'm also on wrong or Marty but cannabis a natural way to go in it helps of pain and most of our population in prison as full interest charges and at the moment I'm going to report now and put it alert for cannabis charges and yes small amount but that small amount still counts which could I work with a DA in living so I used to be a nerdy a patient and now I'm giving back to what they've done for me yeah obvious to say good at that they yes I was put into there and so then that has after going off those medications because the doctors believed I was crazier I'm gonna die and I prove them wrong [Applause] yeah it's crazy so in just to let people know next we have Richard and Brendon before you have a break but we're allowing okay to proceed now because he he needs some support yeah okay a little background about myself I'm blind I'm born dead by one i you know my god I wish I lived no but tonight it really bad Toronto Reinbold I 24 hours you know hey all the time not as Howard in my head yeah hey physical broken bones on Motocross young when I got older now Arthur Isis at the name develop now I have unclear hypertension and the I put in very high over rock climber from a black person I'm diable pushed it through great condemns the new the back don't blind I don't want to go in a line and death so on I'm movin cannabis to fight the progression and to stop going in a bind it I don't want to lose my independence my eye specialist feel great but he can't watch a litter move because the institution formulas I specially there are not up they are not up to up to speed with it you can buy new additional I drove with synthesis cannabis the only way I can deal with the pain in the eye and the only way I can deal with the talento drowning me out and hell I can't have a conversation people know quite isolating and quite depressed again Hanabi help I used to have I used to take any two person years ago I did not like it prescription though long quite dangerous they look like white people my crew soil and they know more by showing a blanket one where we I would like to take a further I think cannabis dry that's where we all right than cannabis the drug can but a medicine a snatch will come from the plan that's not in fact it's five minutes nothing like buying confirm yeah I've introduced myself II know I I'm concerned about the line yeah their missions emotional being and rehab rehab dilatation places doctor's office when they had pamphlet come on you given information packed enemy Hey or do you think ER doctor Center so I'm quite the spirit that they compared me antenna bit the same thing family more dangerous that's from Monson just full of just listens motion not helping but we're going to go or in to legalize cannabis little corner carefully we weren't going to have information don't have to be have to be Claire and a lot of people are on this cannabis Lisbon a quite well booth for pollen and healthy human right this bit I'm follow that my photo and what I say cannabis is a human rights issue there's not to be few as a potential customer or farmers interest more not interesting on farm or a little wee bottle over pi foam extremely difficult access oil that they should be an agency outside office we already have maintainable work with no leg answer no matter how big or how small disability can be visible or can be invisible so they don't judge people I wouldn't like to say it's committed you may not type militant cannabis militant you felt but we do listen to us see how many people actually swear by it ever you don't use that we're not hurting you it's not what the crime and we had no fear of using it because nothing danger that's not dangerous nothing really on the truth the genuine here in plan I mean quite a tomato vegetable carrot carrot should be album accent brightens up now but does they um well we would like to see all these false information to be rectified entry and what else do this and we will never look back again while helping him forth you've you know you've been on the health and economy even a free enterprise in crack jar inject people up hopeful hard like methamphetamine cannabis where at all no freed up like it thank you oh my guys our first of all up thank you for the opportunity to come here today voice my opinions on in this country um broken it up into four different sections here the reason I first became interested in cannabis medication the situation of for myself there now yeah I think we can go forward with us in this country and the concerns that currently we have up against um so first of all the reason I started researching for help from my mother which was diagnosed with Elsa Lamas disease eight years ago now luckily it's been a very slow process if you like unfortunately she was told by the medical fraternity that it was basically nothing we can do let's go and enjoy the recently farm he had there wasn't good enough for me I wanted to help sergeant Sam research came across CBD originally it was hemp seed oil which was proven to be a good for buying food or people with dementia and membrane problems then the CBD came about a football this is what we need to do then I found out that you could actually get a license apply for a license to grow I'm from the rural background so being around farming and who I felt oh my god um so I thought well this is the way forward back then CBD was so that I was license to grow industrial him like THC cannabis four years ago years ago yet just last year managed to obtain my research and breeding license luckily working alongside the man that's that's been very prominent in this industry in this country from the day one anyway so basically that's the reason I became interested in cannabis in cannabis based medication the situation that we're in is the fact that I can grow legally grow a plant that can help my mother but under the current law I'm not allowed to which is a very hard thing to deal with and I course run risk of losing all my work to date my licenses and things if I was seen to be helping my mother with what I'm doing so I'm being extremely careful of course um so yeah it's not just my mother really it's I mean it's become now with the the growing you know information that people are getting around cannabis based medication I'm getting phone calls and emails on a nearly daily basis now can you help me can you help me with because it appears that CBD oils are being marketed as he wills around the world so I see my him business are they calling me for help and of course unfortunately I say okay I can't help you so it's it's very hard to deal with all that um how well I think it could benefit this country and here we here we could potentially go forward I mean I've learned a lot around the legislation of course with my um him licensing and thanks had quite a number of meetings with the Minister of Health already in the last four years so far um basically low THC cannabis hemp should certainly be taken out of the mysteries of Drugs Act um it's basically strangling the industry immensely so if that was to be done it would be they were just another industry to start and and yeah so this needs to be a change there where am i up to sorry guys so also of course I'm sort of leaning towards CBD munication I believe also there's a need for research and access to THC as well because that's proving to be very in official also I do I am aware that of course there's more concern around the safety of THC with being a mind-altering compound but so are many other drugs that we have available to us and wine altering - there we go basically yeah if if we can form a medicinal cannabis industry in this country and if I was given the opportunity to to be a grower of a high quality product I'll make sure you know that I've strive to be on par or if not better leading facilities around the world and I think you know we came to be very good a bit we can take things from other people in there and make it better and I think it would be nice if we could do that and be famous for something else and also yeah I guess the just the concerns that I have witnessed thus far and my cannabis growing time as you know if we're going to to do this efficiently and properly we'd certainly need a really well thought out and good framework to work with as growers is biochemist extract manufacturers of the medicine right through right from the see through sale basically so this is a great opportunity I think it's good that we have you know there's an old saying good things take time and I've witnessed it and my offeree so I think we do need to take some time and get right and yeah so this I hope we can do that and I just like to say that yeah I would done certainly make sure that I do everything possible to to make sure that and work alongside government organisations to help get us over the line basically anyway thank you oh thank you for I thought from across which with us um I come from a long-standing drug law reform background and I have a good science background as well I'm young enough to remember when you could get away with murder if the victim that you've murdered was a homosexual I'm gonna prove that I'm not gonna remember slavery and burning riches no reason I say that is because I guess in a hundred years or even preferably less we will be looking on the misuse of Drugs Act and drug prohibition and scenario here the same way that we look at how we persecuted homosexuals here we give slaves and burnt witches if there's an appalling scenario um but anyhow that's that's just the preamble tonight I was wanting to refer to the Medical Association and the College of GPs and the College of Psychiatrists submission which is very brief and basically they affected obviously or competed notes I think are asserting that there is no efficacy of cannabis and they don't know much about it and we need more research almost contradictory in the way I submit that that the efficacy of cannabis has been long established for thousands of years and it's increasing dramatically especially since the 90s with our work of mckernon planning the Indo cannabinoid system is actually a fundamental function of our bodies so and they are opposed to getting a defensive terminal but if you turn it around the other way what they're saying is these people should should be prosecuted what they don't want to be involved yeah but a lot of the members I know many GPS whoo-hoo so there was an official line so I'm just gonna see any better but leaning on that what they're asserting is that or some people viewing it as it's a medical issue and we won't control it as a medical issue and that's a fundamental philosophical problem I have now I'm very sympathetic to the medical industry I've my daughter's a doctor and I believe in science and that's something I'm not you won't find me ranting on about big pharma conspiracy but you won't yeah it's not like that how and one of the submissions I forget which one suggests that they that cannabis should be lumped in with complementary and alternative medicines yeah that's very problematic as well because well some of those may have some it because they some of them are just ludicrous things like homeopathy are just nonsense and so I'm suggesting those organizations are disappointingly ill informed on this issue really so that's a big worry because you think there would be prestigious people and that there'd be the gold standard of I noticed the protection center of the tiger mid school came out yes they are very full and they are very our favor with this issue like that Salman and things are very fluid up in this issue so I just I'm asking that when we knew deliberating was met that you it just saw this as a medical matter one of the medical people say it's it's actually impacting on how people right people have over their bodies and things and that's that's the big issue and um I don't I don't I wouldn't I mean I laugh at people who use homeopathy and I hope I'm not offending people I probably am I'm sorry Albert Albert we like it but I would not want the criminal laws being any way involved in that whatsoever okay and similarly I think I want the criminal law to be involved in in cannabis yeah and that's that's basically what I want to say to you the there are harms from cannabis people say that but if that's not addictive well you can either there are people who smoke good morning noon and night and you know like zombies but there's not a typical scenario now Nicki you mentioned something about psychosis I don't really want to get involved in that something but you see this figure of 10% yeah I think that's what the outrageously high I think I think I suppose it's been off through a team of what police the right the right rates of schizophrenia have been stable and a stable for at about 1% the country and psychotic I'm perhaps I shouldn't be laughing see if he knew was funny but it's really there will be there okay just you need there's a lot of controversy on that yet that area especially the probably the work of Richie Alton on the pataga longitudinal study is looked at in great detail genetic engineering bases but I just to say you could say well teams in chemists users are going to go psychotic but that I think is a gross exaggeration I just asked them that you you really looked at a lot of a lot of information on that not just like take one fiction oh sorry I'm not I have study that okay I I find they outrageously high and I have looked at the issue but I didn't come here to talk about the technical matters likely I was just sort of trying to give a philosophical review of thee it's don't let the medical profession say this is our issue and we're not going to let you use cannabis that's it's a rights issue and and that's that's really and how the people who need that product what they think about their product their experience of that product within a framework how do we as a society move from it and you're right probably an analysis that we've done at all will go why is that taking us so long that's why I have submitted to the in the building's twenty years ago on this issue I have been the involvement and the policy area for some time in it and I'm dismayed that we're still doing it I was the general secretary of the legalize cannabis party and I've also been on the obvious because of troubles the idea in Christchurch we're not say that I must point out that I have never ever either consume cannabis and people find that hard to believe but I think was I believe in the prohibition is wrong and very very harmful to society and I'm it's now gratifying that that viewers started become mainstream it's starting to but we still have these laws on our books in two years in New Zealand as cannabis prohibition and and it has it does not have good basis they might do that but I'm ranting it's only a polemic okay so we just gonna have a little break everybody"
MbC1dKWeZxQ,What&#39;s in cannabis-derived medicines? - BBC News,2018-07-29T13:30:00Z,cannabis plants contained over a hundred active chemicals known as cannabinoids most of them are found in the flower of the plant rather than the leaves two key compounds are THC which is psychoactive it produces the high which recreational users are seeking the other is CBD or cannabidiol which is not psychoactive now both those compounds are used to create medicines GW Pharmaceuticals produces 300 tons of cannabis plants each year under license from the government to produce to cannabis derived medicines one for multiple sclerosis the other for childhood epilepsy so how does what's produced here differ from other cannabis products well you can buy cannabis oil in health food shops but it's not pharmaceutical grade so you can't be certain of its strength or consistency and cannabis drugs produced in the Netherlands Canada or elsewhere are not licensed regulated medicines so they haven't undergone stringent clinical trials firstly it should make it easier for doctors to prescribe cannabis medicines secondly it'll be easier to do research into the potential benefits of compounds derived from cannabis and thirdly it should be easier to bring cannabis medicines into the UK [Music] Cannabis remains an illegal Class B drug so the production possession and dealing of cannabis are still criminal offenses anyone growing this lot at home would risk a jail term

V5WokAbnZtM,Medicinal cannabis reform (NZ): online Q&amp;A session 12 March 2018,2018-03-13T04:30:21Z,I'm Carly Murcia I'm policy manager at New Zealand drug Foundation sitting here in Wellington and this is my colleague Steven black foods Communications Manager lovely day in Wellington today I hear people have signed in from all around the country which is great from down south and McCardle all the way up north to car tyre so welcome to Wellington virtually and I am going to talk a bit about the Builder misuse of drugs a medicinal cannabis amendment bill to give it its full glorious name and I'm also going to talk to you a bit about how you do submissions on net bill so purpose of this series of lectures that we're doing really is to demystify the process so that people find that easy to make a submission to get their voice heard and we're particularly interested in getting the voices of patients who because the government generally will mostly be hearing from medical professional medical associations and policy advisers but really important to hear from people out there who are from patients from Kiera's from support people who have personal experience of medicinal cannabis so yeah we hear them make you try and help you feel confident about the proceeds to demystify it and to show you that it's actually just a really simple thing to do in really important your democratic right to make yourself heard politicians are elected to to represent you empowerment and this is your way of making sure they know what you think so you know what I'll do is I'll talk for about 20 minutes first and take you through the submission process and a bit about the bill what it see is what we think is good about it what we think it's bad about it what we think should change and I mean we won't have question a Q&A session after that so hopefully we'll have a good 20 minutes to half an hour of Q&A at the end feel free to ask any question you want nothing is too stupid just go for it yeah but before I start talking about the substantive stuff Stephen is just going to briefly talk to you about the how the technology works yeah hi the meeting today is something is being broadcast using zoom meetings you may some of you may have you said before I'm just going to give you a quick overview of the key features because as we advertised it we do want this to be about a online Q&A and we want to accept questions so what I'm going to show you here it's just the main things ways that you can ask questions now on your page as this photo has taken a little bit before you'll see down the bottom a little strip and it's got three different options for interacting those three things are Q&A raising your hand and chat now these are the so if you've got a question please the best way to do that is to insert it into the Q&A box and that pops up when you you click on Q&A at the bottom of the screen or if you're using a mobile device like a an iPad or something like that as far as at the top the other thing that you can do is that you can raise your hand particular do that if you're having a little bit of problem with a sound or some technical thing you can't you need a little bit of help on that and one other team will do their best to help out and then the final thing that you can do is test now you can send a message to any of the team here at the drug Foundation or you can send out a message the ghostie to everyone I'm hoping that you clicking on that now and you'll see that I put a question in the asking where people have come from you get I'm really we really want to encourage people to feel at home I'm great cup of tea and so Becky but I do feel that you can ask questions as we go yes so as well as Kylie and me here I think I forgot Natalie our communications advisor behind the scenes really to answer any technical questions and any tongs cheese actually in Oakland today and she is also helping with the facilitation decision today is being recorded and we haven't quite decided how there will be made available what we look to to share that of of this demand and yeah I think that's about it if you do have other questions please feel free to to to raise them through the chat and now I'm going to hand it back to Carly and you're gonna I'm gonna dis Lee stopped hearing the screen and Carly's going to actually you can put the first okay so I just wanted to quickly talk to you about the legislative process for those that don't know much about how a bill becomes law so a bill is just basically a proposed law and it may be written by government or an MP in this case the government has written this particular bill so the first you hopefully have a slide there explaining how it goes through Parliament so first you hit the first reading and all MPs will get to vote on whether the bill goes through to the Select Committee and that's happened the MPs have all agreed to put this bill to sleep committee and it sits where it is now and it's where you have a chance to make submissions on the bill so once it's gone through the Select Committee so don't make a report on the bill and then probably make some changes hopefully on the basis of your submissions and then it will go through keep going through the process it'll have a second reading so it goes back to Parliament everyone has another chance to debate on it if it passes that reading then it will go into what's called the committee of the whole house we're MPs will look at each part of the bill in detail and discuss each but and really not about in detail and then we'll have another iteration of the bill which will then go to the third reading and if it passes the end the bill will become an act or an author also known as a statute so it's basically how a bill becomes law so this medicinal cannabis bill is currently at a select committee stage where we head to next slide please and a select committee there are about 17 of these in Parliament and they all look at different subjects so this particular one is the Health Select Committee that's been our to look at this bill there are eight members half of them national half of them are labor in the chairperson is Louis award so these are basically the eight characters that you need to convince on your point of view sometimes members can change but their likelihood is it'll be these eights that will be hearing your solution so and you'll have two chances also to enter them once with your written submission and then once with your oral submission so when you do your written submission you have an option to say I would like to present early as well and really encourage you to do that and then so you can then go along to Parliament in talk to them about your submission as well and as I said before really keen to get patients care and support people to do submissions it's really important part of the democratic person not that had it's not its theory and we were very happy to help you do it if you have any problems as well so just be in touch and folks I just wanted to emphasize that MPs really love to hear people's personal stories it's you have been a lot into elite committee hearing it's when someone starts talking about their personal story and how this bill personally impacts them on the ground that MP suddenly wake up we sort of sitting there all dozy and then they suddenly it's a human nature thing I guess to find personal stories really engaging so the more personal stories we can get and in the submission process the better and so next next slide can I just say one year so this is the website you'll go to when you're doing your submission and I will send you an email after this which is all the details you know need to know about how to link in to this and so on and you want me not so interesting to just stare at it okay so the submissions are due on the 21st of March which i think is actually creeping up on us and may even be next week and because as we say next week so we haven't got much time it's been a really abbreviated submission process this time unfortunate so we've hit to do these workshops on a bit of a rush so it's important to get your personal story into your submission we'll be doing quite a technical submission probably and in feel free to leave all the technical details to us in other organizations that are working on behalf of patient rights and just keep it really simple I mean you can get into the technical stuff if you walk back you can also just keep it simple say this is my story this is what I need the build to do for me it's also worth noting that as I see it before you can say that you want to do an oral submission in the silic committee can on occasion travel to different locations so if you have an issue traveling through disability or because you have no money because your sickness benefit do say that and you on submission say I can't make it and I would like to present to you we have enough people doing that they may very well travel around New Zealand I mean it's unlikely don't go to the small centres but they could very well go to Christchurch Auckland so put that in your submission and and then when it comes to actually writing your submission the things you have to think about keep it simple keep it clear if it's long it's a good idea to have subheadings so that they in peace can just read it really fast because if you think about it they've got probably a pile of papers about this receipe on the desk every morning I've got them at a time they'll be spending a limited time on your written submission so make sure they can work out what you're saying and what you're recommending within the first minute or two that they're looking at it if they have to wade through an awful lot of stuff to get to your key points they may very well give up but again you've got another to put your view through on the in the oral submission process and we recommend you do that because much easier I think to convince someone of something when you're sitting right in front of them looking at them when you're writing and both are important and also with your written submission run it by a friend it's really important to have the grammar and the spelling and all that accurate so if you're not very good at this stuff get someone else to head take a look at it it's really it's really not something to be worried about you can write a paragraph if you want you can write two paragraphs or you can write a book it's up to you do recommend if you have a book that you have maybe contents in an executive summary in it yeah just think about will my message be able to get across clearly and quickly to the people that matter other things you have to put in your name your contact details if you're doing a written submission and not online if you're actually sending a paper copy to Parliament and put those details your contact details on a separate page so they don't form part of a written submission which leads me to the next main point which is that privacy so your submission will be actually public it'll be published on the panel at website but just think about that's gonna allow me in any legal difficulties should I admit I'm growing six cannabis plants in the garden probably not but realistically if you say you consume cannabis from time to time because of a medical issue it's fairly unlikely that you would get into legal trouble but you just need to be aware that you need to balance that risk so you know don't give personal details about another individuals health issues without their permission as well so firstly wanted to talk a little bit before we get into the substance of the bill and I wanted to talk a bit about what is the distal cannabis because it's a quite confusing subject to everyone including us and the reason for that is that whoever you're talking to will have a different way of defining it for themselves so you just need to be aware that you'll talk about whether smoked cannabis the person you're talking to may actually understand something quite different from you so some people when they talk about medicinal cannabis will mean the whole plant so something may be that they're growing in their garden which they use to medicate here and how they might smoke it they might use that make it into an oil or a teacher some kind of stretch they may make it and eat it so there's lots of different ways or they might be put so there's different ways to take it and there's lots of scientific evidence now that cannabis is really effective for a lot of different health conditions as well and I think that's pretty much beyond dispute that it's there that's very effective to some conditions so other people when they talk about medicinal cannabis will talk about it as a pharmaceutical product so it's something that's been made by a company in a lab and it has extracts from the cannabis plant in it so for example set of X or tilray it may have CBD unit which is cannabadiol which is one of the component parts of cannabis or it may have THC in it most likely it will have a combination of those two compounds plus some other compounds as well so yeah different when you're doing your submission just be aware that you are quite clear about whether you're talking about using the botanical plant or whether you're talking about using a pharmaceutical product and so the next thing has a legal situation in New Zealand so cannabis is obviously illegal it's a controlled drug under the misuse of Drugs Act so you can't just smoke it however doctors can prescribe it for various conditions or for any condition really provided they can get the Ministry of Health to approve their prescription so it has to go through quite a long wondered process that you do want to get medicinal cannabis or you know pharmaceutical medicinal cannabis at the moment and then of course you can't get we can't grow your own at the moment that's strictly against the law so although it's officially available in New Zealand that's pretty hard to get only about two hundred and fifty-five people as of last December I think had actually managed to get set of its prescribed to them in New Zealand since 2008 we have the next slide Islam and so the various barriers for people currently to get medicinal cannabis things like the cost so sativex which is can be prescribed for multiple sclerosis at the moment without Ministry of Health approval which needs approval from Ministry of Health to any other condition and that can cost up to twelve hundred dollars a month so it's not a cheap process at all there's also not very many really good products available internationally at the moment after that high pharmaceutical grade standards and then it was the medical provision doesn't know much about it they don't get to talk about the endocannabinoid system I don't think at medical school so there's a lot of resistance and lack of knowledge from from doctors about prescribing it and from some others are more of them in and of course another main barrier is the legality of it currently so moving along to the next slide which is about the cannabis bill itself so you may have been aware there were two bills the first one passed its first reading and that was put forward by the Green Party so that bill would have legalized cultivation purchase position in use for people suffering from a debilitating illness and the other one so that they didn't go through so the government bill doesn't allow you to grow your own cannabis at all what's it's really focused on paving the way for domestic production of medicinal cannabis products so it's about trying to make products more available in New Zealand and what it also does is it gives a statutory exemption and defense to terminally ill patients who are found to be using mechanical or grow your own cannabis in the meantime until so and still they're good until they're good products available if you have a terminal illness and you're found to be using cannabis you won't be prosecuted and that's the one that we're looking at at the moment so the bill itself doesn't really is quite big doesn't really give an awful lot of information about how this is all going to work what it all looks like basically we had to go we had to go and look at all the cabinet papers that the Ministry of Health had written into the government and to explain this whole thing in order to understand what the bill was trying to say it's very confusing bill if it I don't even recommend you read it because you'll be probably less wise afterwards than you were before so basically what the government is trying to do is develop a system whereby we can make the products in New Zealand and have inter access to them also by importing more products so they want to set up an agency to oversee cultivation develop minimum quality standards for products that means that doctors would be able to be confident that what they were prescribing had the same potency every time hit the same ratio of THC and CBD every time didn't have mold and it didn't have pesticides in it so the doctor would know that they were getting a quality product and it would hopefully then give them the confidence to prescribe it the government's also outside of the legislation trying to make it easier to import products they're gonna set up this Advisory Committee hopefully including a patient voice and that advisory committee will be asked to to advise on whether it's going to be possible to simplify the current prescribing process so that's what I was talking about when you have to go to the Ministry of Health each time you want the prescription and to make sure that they approve that this product is new to your condition at this time so hopefully that committee will be set up and will find that it's not necessarily necessary to go through Ministry of Health to get approval every time and it is actually an easier way to do it unless it's easier way so hopefully it'll be easier to access products hopefully and under the scheme it will be easier to import products as well it's another thing that there will be an advising on it's the really the main gist of the government bill and then this other thing is the the thing that's had the most attention really is the bit about terminally ill patients not being prosecuted so there is actually not the major focus of the bill it's just a temporary thing so they're going to look at that again and 2020 and decide whether they still need to keep that in so the government I think is intending for when all these products become available in New Zealand and we've got a really good range of products in good quality products then there's no reason for people to be growing their own at home so you know if you think that there still would be a reason to grow your own at home then do cut that in your in your submission and the other thing that this government bill does is it D schedules CBD products which the Kennedy or which I was talking about before it's actually really happened already in the regulations I think last September so doctors can already prescribe CBD products so this is really just a formality that they're going to put that into the into the law itself rather than just the regulations yeah so there is the government intentions I wanted to talk a little bit about what these what this really means so setting up a a system in New Zealand is a really good thing and could be wonderful patients very in favor of it but one thing to really think about is that it could take a lot of time so in Australia they've tried to do something similar then let's pinch know they've spent about three years I think now working on it and haven't yet got any product to market so that's something to think about the other thing to think about is that we are having to submit by 21st of March on this bill but the problem was the actual detail of the bill is not going to be here until they write the regulations that will company the bill so the regulations are just all the various detailed rules that would sit alongside the nor what does go what this bill does is cut most of the work of thinking process around how medicine or cannabis would look and who would get it and how you would prescribe it that all goes into the regulations not the bill so we're really making submissions on there quite a bake bill which is an issue we won't really know what the government ends for the bill until they've actually written the regulation and the government doesn't really know yet what's going to be in those regulations so that's a problem but I think what that means for us when we make submissions is that we need to see how we think a regulatory system should look what products we think should be available what they should look like should they be hold plant products or should they be only read pharmaceutical grade teachers or what what do we think needs to go and what do we think the regulations need to actually do for patients so we've got a good opportunity really to help the Ministry of Health to formulate their thinking around how the final system will actually look and what conditions will be able to prescribe for and what products will be able to prescribe so and if you have good thoughts about that do put that in submission as well and so I think that was all on the actual act itself and let me go to the next next slide please sure so the key things I just want to go really quickly through the key things that we think could be improved about this bill the first one is my comment before that we don't really know yet what's going to be in the in the regulations and that makes it really hard to submit on it and ideally we'd like an opportunity to submit later as well once we know what the actual regulations will be the second point is that the statutory defense so that says you won't be prosecuted if you're found with botanical cannabis it only applies to terminally ill patients not their support people so if you are looking after a terminally ill patient and give them some cannabis because they're not able to to source it themselves or to take it themselves because they're so ill then you would actually be liable and not just for possessing it was actually a higher penalty so we don't really think that it's just you know if you're really sick how are you going to get hold of it yourself anyway that it's not really logical for us and so the Ministry of Health's idea about this was that enforcement was going to be too difficult because it would be too hard to define which support people we're supplying a patient and how much they needed to supply to the patient and just in general they were worried that the compassionate grow of someone who was growing on behalf of another person who was sick and may end up arguing that the statutory defense would cover their activity and which I think you know is actually well why not but that's what the administrative health advised the minister so this system set up around the world that actually get over these problems so I don't think that there was a good reason not to include a defense for support people I think there's ways that we could actually write a really good robust law around this we put in some of those details into our submission yeah and so the number three patients with other conditions will not be covered so it's including severe pain so there's a range of different conditions that medical cannabis has been shown to work for so it's a shame that they weren't put into this as well so the 100-day plan of the government said that they would be looking at providing medicine or finding a way to get medicine or cannabis to the public for terminal illness and chronic pain they've taken chronic pain out they've only applied it's a terminal illness unfortunately in this defense and the reason for that was that they advise the Ministry of Health advised that chronic pain and it's too difficult to define subjective and would potentially cover a large patient group so they said 21% of the population may may at some point have chronic pain and therefore that's too wide a group to extend this particular law to basically afraid of legal dispute for extending it too widely we think that's a lost opportunity they could have come up with a different wording than chronic pain if they didn't like that one so they could have for example so you extended it to severe and debilitating illness or they could have said a condition that a doctor certifies as a genuine one or there would have been different ways to word that so that it wasn't just restricted to terminal illness number four the statutory defense that patients obtain or consume cannabis but not cultivator and and so this one yeah this I mean this is probably one of the big the contention that this bill rather like other than the greens bill whereas the greens bill would have allowed you to cultivate your own cannabis use this one doesn't so if it's something it's important to you do put that into your submission so under the current bill patients will still have to get their and their cannabis from the black-market until until the point where the domestic market is able to supply product easily and affordable and affordabl accessible way to people and there's no desperation to people who might be growing their own cannabis so the terminally ill Chris and we're growing their own cannabis they wouldn't have a defense for that or someone else's growing to them there'd be no defense for them as well so I think the Ministry of Health was most concerned here about trying to police growing like how would you know that if someone said they were growing for a terminally ill person how would you know that they were definitely growing for them and not for the black market they were also worried so the MPs are worried that having men exits to medicinal cannabis in terms of a whole plant growing in the garden could lead to a quasi legalization or quasi yeah cause he really Ghilas ation of recreational cannabis and that maybe young people would have more access to it so it was some of the arguments that MP MPs gave and on the first reading and again we think there's actually good system set up around the world say for example in Canada with a heavy regulatory system which sits in detail how all these issues can be fought around so I don't think they were really valid reason not to extend the not to extend this particular bill to growing growing in cultivating at home right so are there any questions at the moment cuz I was going to talk about their oral submission Percy schnitz but we could talk with any questions that you think we haven't covered off Stephen kind of got one question statement come through so maybe we'll just mix things up a bit and to get people in the frame of mind that we do want to have any other questions come through I'll read this out but unless all you people people do want to override me and you could raise your hand if you want to hear from Carly now so I see a lot of hands go otherwise I read this question he runs frantically searching to raise their hands I can tell ya this has come through from one of our participants I don't think I qualify as a patient but I also think I can exist without cannabis in my life I don't think I can exist without cannabis in my life on a daily basis but that makes me a criminal to stay well and balanced I suffer from insomnia loss of appetite and anxiety I will not take the medication given to me by my doctors as a side effects are unbearable thanks thanks for that um so those are actual conditions anxiety and inability to sleep and loss of appetite those are serious conditions and cannabis has been shown I think quite conclusively to help with those conditions so it's worth making a submission about that and saying you know this is the condition that I really need help with and this is the reasons I can't take other medications this is the reason cannabis is really important to me and you know those conditions are perfectly valid or used for medicinal cannabis so put that down right so that's important to you and why and why you know you may think that you have a right to access medicine that helps you if it's not harming anyone else so I would argue that was a human right and in fact there was a Supreme Court case in Canada which decided that yes it's a human right to be able to access the medicine that exists it's not harming other people so yeah write that down please don't thanks for that at this stage we have another question yeah yeah now the question which I'll read out and I need to come back on the screen that's what I was going to get away with I have multiple sclerosis I wonder if there's any possibilities to get cannabis patches for my back shoulder pain [Music] should I US asked my doctors yet so multiple sclerosis is one of the ones that the set of its would be available for I mean I'm not an expert on the different medications and you definitely we're talking to your doctor about and if you don't get any joy there it's probably with contacting medical medical cannabis are we in s New Zealand in canes and I can send you the link of it but so though so multiple sclerosis it's possible year that they will be helpful to you but differently we're talking to your doctor and just about so I'm more of an expert on the policy side of things not the medical side of things so yeah I probably can't help you in detail on that one sorry um so we might just head back now to the to my presentation I just wanted to talk to you about oral submissions so as I said when you write your written submission you can say hey I'd really like to do an old submission and we really make you do that even if you actually don't feel like it just write it in there and you could make it at it in the ballot later so a few weeks after you do your written submission you probably get a phone call or an email from the classic committee saying hey are you free on the stage to do a presentation in Wellington at that point you can pull out if you don't really want to do it so just put in a new submission anyway but ideally you will do it and as I say you have to come to Wellington and if they do decide to travel so this is a picture of a submission room there's a few different submission rooms this is the biggest one and I've never had to submit in there it's usually in a smaller one which isn't actually Storting looking but I suspect medicinal cannabis might be popular so they might put it in the bigger room so you've got you can look at the tables there you've got those two people in the middle with the white and the red are the people presenting or submitting and they're talking - we've got the chair at the end opposite end it will be Louis the wall and then you've got the I think the label people down the list in the National NPS down the right and then over on the left you've probably those will be the the various clerks who do the administration and we've got who's speaking next and all that sort of stuff and possibly the policy advisers will be sitting there as well and from the Ministry of Health and then of course you've got the audience in the media will be set up along the front here in the foreground so although it looks daunting it's actually just not that scary when she sits actually quite fun once you start presenting that's my experience so may feel a little nervous but it's well worth it because you're actually going to be heard by a lot of people who have a real interest in this topic and you could actually impact you know what they decide and the in so the other thing to think about is that we the drug found Asian me and my colleagues are being very happy to help you prepare your submission or to rehearse such would also be happy to go down there with you will be probably looking about Parliament for most of the process so you know we can meet you outside we can take you and we can make it as easy as it possibly can be for you so don't be afraid to to go and do a submission there's also the option to come in on telephone if you can't travel and if they're not going to travel when ideally you will be there in person because it makes a much bigger impact but if you can't do the X then you can be man on telephone as well to tell your story let's see so you can take your friends and family along to support you you can take a salon to support you if you want you probably get about five to ten or somewhere between five and fifteen minutes probably around ten minutes on average you should stick to a very few key messages coz that time will go really quickly so just choose maybe two or three key messages whatever you do don't read out of your submission because it's incredibly boring and everyone will just go to sleep but you know if you do want to write some key notes down and then to read them out it's absolutely fine but I don't read from the submission because I've already seen it in theory and read it and absorbed it um also if you've got ten minutes then make sure you leave five of those minutes for questions from the NP so this is the time for the MPS to really dig deep and find out you know to ask questions from real people who experiencing these things so they'll really want to ask questions but they'll usually get ruthlessly cut off I'm at the 10-minute point or 15 min a point so try and leave a lot of space for them to ask questions things to think about try and structure your talk before you go so you know roughly what you're going to be talking about ideally practice in front of the mirror or from friends or in front of us we can help you as I see it before we'd be happy to to rehearse it with you and the reason to this is that we've been to lots of submissions and seeing lots of people present and not put their best foot forward I guess not really making the most of this opportunity so we'd like to make sure that people who are presenting are really grabbing that opportunity and making the most of it other thing to think about is you can go early in the morning say your honor 11 you can go this thing like check online on the Parliament website when they're starting turn up at the beginning and then you can get a sense for what's being said already and what the mood is and then you can you can pitch your talk you can change your talk and something's come up a lot already you can you know focus on the bits they haven't think of it yet a really important thing is to stay polite so you'll probably eat in peace or you may maybe it's just us that get this book you know some of the in peace can be a little bit bolshy and ask for questions because they don't agree with you it's probably slightly to have to happen with patience talking but yeah so the main thing is always stay polite always stay friendly don't get into some kind of aggressive argument or anything the in peace I guess it goes without saying but that's still with saying make sure you don't defame anyone make sure you don't say anything that could get you and illegal hot water same as with the written submission and yeah we can help you we can help you formulate your key messages and stuff so do me in touch as a question I just yeah I think that was all oh yeah you can also table extra material at that point if you've got supplementary information at the point that you're doing it all submission and it may be that it's worth doing if the if more advice has come out from the Ministry of Health in the meantime about what we need to do in terms of how it sets up the regulations and you can also submit there's a group but we can mean that if you do do that you have you rehearse together to make sure that one person's not going to just take up all the time and yeah so that's a submission process and then I think we're gonna turn to questions in a second but I just also wanted to show you quickly and other ways you can influence emps as well outside of the Select Committee process so after the secret reading as I see that would go to the committee of the whole house and then all MPs will discuss it so it's worth you being in touch with your MP to talk to them about about your views so you can contact them by phone or email and go into the electorate office and talk to them or you can write letters to all of the MPs or just specific ones that you think are key and you can write letters to the editor in and we'll be actually giving it will email your hand out in a minute actually about the various different ways you can Lobby to get your voice food outside of the Select Committee process so we're going to look at that yeah so you've got some community yeah yeah hi everyone again thanks for sending through your questions I'll just go through them three here the first weigh-in is is the New Zealand drug foundation going to sheer submission before the 21st so he can get some ideas of what to include yes that's a great question in a dream world we would have shared it with you already but we're so busy running workshops we haven't written it yet so I'm hoping that the dress will be at a couple or a few days before its June and we'll do our best but this week we're spending the whole week traveling giving these workshops what to in Auckland yeah maybe we'll be able to put up a draft but possibly not the final but we will seen you as much information is we have available and I think if you have logged into this we have your email and so we will we'll send you all the information that we've already got various handouts and we'll send you a template that you can fill in to help you to help you form your thinking and yet if we've got the submission during time we won't send it to you I mean most of what we're saying is really reasonably clear on the website all really I think just some of the technical detail that we haven't really clarified you so yeah I think that's good we can commit to sending it to you that's really and maybe sending you a draft of it isn't in advance but it won't be very much in about sorry guys okay the next question we've got here is as one asking I really appreciate your help with my submission how can we do this yep so I'm not sure if it's the written part or the oral part but with the written part I mean you can first look at all their material to see if that answers your questions and and then if not give us a call and we can talk through the structure how you want to do it the kinds of things that you might put in there the kinds of things you wouldn't put in there and we can do that and or we can actually have a look at the draft I mean I can't promise that we can get really good editing on all everyone's drafts because there's essentially it's not that much time before it's true and we made me run off your feet but do our best and we know one or two other patients and patient advocacy groups that may also be able to help so you're really struggling give us a call and then when it comes to oral submissions again we'll probably be making our officers available for people to come in and rehearse or we can rehearse in a cafe outside Parliament before here and what do suits just be in touch with you feel you need help we'll do our very best within capacity restriction yes so stay tuned be the email and details of how to get in touch with us through the and a slide coming up but you can also just get that off our website I've got another question here this is from Joe is this submission a place to address New Zealand the the referendum that's planned on medicinal and or recreational cannabis I believe this is scheduled for 2020 why can't a referendum happen sooner yes I the referendum was part of a coalition agreement and it's about recreational cannabis only so it's due to happen by 2020 or before they have an actually see today it may actually happen before I suspect that they'll probably want to keep it back till 2020 and attach it to the next election so that it's not because it will be a lot cheaper and they won't want to get into the hot water that the last government got into with the flag referring them that it was costing huge amount of money so they probably will want to attach it on to the next general election that's my guess so it's quite different I think so the needs of medicinal cannabis patients are quite different from the rights of recreational cannabis you know people who use cannabis recreational recreationally medicine or cannabis patients really need really good quality medicines and and that can be quite different from you know access to so some of the needs are the same so for example you don't want to know either a recreational user nor medicine user should be prosecuted or made into a criminal in my view but they also are quite different because medicinal cannabis patients need quite a different system and they need access to quite a lot more cannabis quite a lot cheaper as well so in Canada for example they have two different systems well actually recreational is still illegal though you wouldn't be able to tell it from walking down the street in Canada now but they've got a mail-order system for medicinal cannabis in or you can grow small amounts of your own if you register that with a health practitioner and you can also think now get it from dispensary so I don't think that's actually strictly legal so we've got a mail-order mostly system for medicinal cannabis and they're going to have dispensaries for recreational cannabis so they're keeping them quite secret and I think that's probably right okay well that's all the questions for now some kind of more things to cover have you um know I think actually he's got to the end of what I was wanting to say and there's a slide there about how you can get more information somewhere I mean basically you can give us a call you can go onto our website if you look on the go website and look on the policy pages and then go to the medicinal cannabis page and under that there's a whole section on how to do a submission and that will take you through some of our the content stuff as well as the logistical stuff and it gives you a link to the Calment website here as well you can also google to find that but it's actually really hard to find if you don't know exactly what stipend the bill again is called the misuse of drugs medicinal cannabis amendment though we googled that you probably find it but might be easier to go through our website which one strike foundation NZ and go into the policy pages then and yet you can email me is my email address I may take a couple of days to get back because I'm traveling and doing these workshops at the moment but I'll do my very best to get back to you as soon as possible it's really nice to hear from people you know and to get the stories that people are experiencing cuz it helped me do my job better as well as I know you know how things actually are for real people in the real world that's really helpful and I can think their understanding into the submission that we're writing here as well so thank you very much for tuning and I don't think there's any point continue if there's no more questions any more questions I think we're all good um but yeah if you do have questions that occur to you later do be in touch and thank you again for joining us and I really hope you'll be making submissions it's not hard I've seen your template in a minute and you can just fill it in turn it off easy peasy well with that so thanks guys in good luck with the process and enjoy the rest of your day you
3TkkZAVvmHI,Jenny Hallam Part 2 of the Australian Medical Cannabis Interview,2018-01-31T14:14:28Z,[Music] is this whole fear into saying the news agenda will leave you a fool idea for you to canvas have to worry about design there is a blog where people are they using alcohol every day interest in a punching people in the head using other drugs you know recreationally like where it'll just be useful the psychic analyzed and we might attack apiece you know I'm just tired of it and we know we know you know the pharmaceutical companies and I just want to say if anybody why don't we have it here in Australia I'm just gonna cite one night and one night only Malcolm - mouths - as two unique nations - pharmacy the one that's holding bodies break out these he's little paint which is little paint on so they took at least 30 days when I announced it was late we have officially kind of a sinister purpose in this country unfortunately we don't have access like break out put it in the hands are steaks which they knew would cause them solute chaos because no state wants to be the first one to bring the through everyone wants to watch and see what the other states are going to go right over here exactly chaos and slowed everything down so we're pretty angry at the moment because we have been screwed by this government we have been promising it on again and they just haven't delivered they have been fluid we have email was leaked to us so they basically so that I've said one thing to arson and I've done something completely different and we're tired over the records you know it's only two more when I stop we have no idea when we're going to get that that is the tree that is maturing weekend no idea what we taught a point on a met with you know hundred dates on it and yeah because at the moment we are students vital history but you say restore to anything that's how we respect them and I think that that's on top of that is the pharmaceutical companies and when we have people are now Contreras worth having she is the best in these pharmaceutical companies that is when Lucy table poachers in GW Pharma and GW Pharma make epidural X and capital X is they're basically the drug that they have many may have the contract for life in Queensland at least in Queensland we know that there is definitely information going on we want to hold but unfortunately we're getting at the dire which is a save me day pretty much product that is not effective and we know they join the cannabis trials in Queensland with all things now the now we already know the studies have already come out overseas Doyle exactly canvas effective in elements in case of epilepsy defective so widely using a drug that we know he's already only ten percent effective in Detroit we know we're setting the exact available so we have a drug because only ten percent effective we know our results are going to be no more than ten percent and that's not good enough to pass anything through so they have seven restaurants have to fight and this is why where I work manipulation is all the [ __ ] boys and the thing is it's a constantly in his way and they secretly recording for the interviews and then different government officials and so we have ways each unit when I say one thing in one meeting they deny saying that another reason and then in the next meeting they always say either of those things but we have recordings of everything so it's getting to the point where people are getting smart now they starting to record in museums and we're now starting to prove the [ __ ] and and is making a lot of people not really it is hard to foreign to information in one place then I'm going to tell you now you I'm not going to promote anything you don't want to face these employers and that's what I'm going to say there is a lot of groups out there that are giving out information there there are support groups there's some a groups and I'm not going to name anybody but there are some a groups and pushing out information that is not helping anybody hands vested interest so you have to be careful with India the only thing I can suggest a people is asked around going to lots of different groups ask the same question to you know multitudes of people and see what you get and when you get the same answer from fifty people then you're probably places that's probably the right answer but the best thing that you can do if you want information on cannabis probably in front of us the only place you're gonna get real balance information with those proper and besides white pubmed go to the site go to the actual studies now there's both emphasis on online people understand there are studies and there are articles as sometimes write me some so that might not necessarily be true and there are a lot of the hospitals out there but absolute [ __ ] one of the front which is the hole I saw it is dangerous and that's what I'd like to address as well this hole I suppose were alcohol is dangerous to use is brought up when people start selling the big extraction machines that were crossing two or three thousand dollars and people were saying oh no that's too expensive and I won't buying them so people started saying okay well are you gonna get in there because you can't use a ricer oh because that's dangerous we found out that's dangerous so you just look at the studies it's not realizing all the time and they started saying that I say was dangerous was about the same time they started releasing with these new machines that they want a lotta money look back a boy things makes it they actually studies not just the articles because articles long as they are simply people's opinions and everybody has a different opinion it's so if they want one menaced unbiased information go to studies dirtier things like hip-hop Nets Google is your best friend sighing question and look look at the arts are nearly 20 different sides and like I said when you gotta get the same answer 10-15 times then you know you're pretty much right so all I can say is you know just you've got to do your own research there's a lot of misinformation out there and it's hard to say one side in particular there is okay you know this there's a lot of people that some sighs I might have 10 no great articles and 5 [ __ ] like so it's up to us to bond that information [Music] but we have to start looking at some different ways we try changing at three legislation three politicians and then just listening to us they are waiting so we're going to look at some other place we look at your chance record sideways you know everyone's going to stop meeting guilty we're gonna fight without charges you know we are not guilty so we need to we need to say that moon so we have to start finding our judges I'd like to see my class action and I'd like any voice out there so taking action against this government metis from us they basically told us it was late last year and we have a later we still don't have access we have people dying and so I'd like to start a class action against the government with public medical treatment that is a medical necessity to most things oh and see what we can do with it because there seems to be what's happening over America we've got young all over in America the challenging young man that seems to be getting somewhere slightly suspect so we need some boys that cleans you up it's gonna be expensive it is gonna be hard but I tell me there's a few other ways out there that could make a name for themselves out of this you know Sydney from all the words if they pray that I supported a young child there is someone out there we need someone that if anybody's willing to do it contact me we'll get our furniture packing boobage I found me a job they demanded or what we just want someone who's really so you put their logins where the business is going to be one of those big cases this is going to be one of those Erin Brockovich is gonna change people's lives and not just change people's lives but say millions of lives because this would be a treatment for me and every treat given every day treatment use in hospitals in 20 years five months is legal it'll be something that's just the hospital to is you don't even ask where the unwanted or not is just just why we don't get our swar medications you know but that's what will happen you will have cataracts whether you're not on that's the way everybody so it's time we get this what a spontaneous stand up I want people to stop me stop being ashamed there isn't other than the government telling us that his government are punching tickets what they doing to us look at the cycles marriage to my YouTube euthanization about look at Adani the coalmine with everything that they doing that mutinies understand that politicians are a bunch of decades and wait April and look after us and world date so get out they might get oil and stand up in Samoa I'm really hoping that in a year's time I can catch in there yet mom things are going really well and the legalization of either done on it's very very close our website economically for the sake of everyone because more than anything in the only reason I started is that is based is a lot of people to be well and happy that's it that's a lot of money enemies I don't want and you know reputation and I just want everyone to be well and some type Isis made a spanking Michael well and happy burger if I need a break [Music] you [Music]

aVXWDNq-33g,Medical Marijuana The Triple M Story 2018,2018-05-15T17:05:58Z,an FDA panel will vote on whether or not to recommend approving the first drug made from the marijuana plant they look at multiple sclerosis and found that it was in fact effective for treating spasms muscle tightness and pain my big idea or sharing is that medicinal cannabis can be the healthcare success story of our lifetimes but only if we all engage in learning the truth and ask our federal government to end prohibition of cannabis I went from my eye exam and I'm pre glaucoma and the pressure on my eyes are like 15 to 17 the pressure all of a sudden now they're down to 1213 pressure in there it reduced the pressure my eyes I'm diabetic and all of my ia 1c and my daily glucose testing all the numbers all came up low I don't get I usually get back spasms during the day at the back 2000 it's been shown to have anti-inflammatory components anti spasticity there's a lot of anecdotal evidence that's coming out that potentially that it has neuro protective components to it in addition to there are some cancers where it's been anti tomorrow which is really exciting these people have been on prescription meds for years and either that therapy is stopped working or they've needed to find you know they've heard and read in totally about medical medical marijuana and the benefits of it and they're slowly becoming believers I met a woman from born that was in our waiting room one day and I said why and she said and she pulled out her hands and she showed me how arthritic they were to go as I finally broke down in December of this year got my card and then the best winter we've ever had [Music] the voters approved in 2012 medical marijuana and then in 2013 the state put in to effect an application process we submitted an application as medical marijuana of Massachusetts and we then applied and we were successful in receiving three applications that were approved and we also had the highest score out of all the other applicants well I'm the co-founder of Triple M and I'm also the general counsel and compliance officer it entails in terms of the compliance officer making sure that we're fully compliant with all the Massachusetts regulations and that includes inventory or seed to sale making sure that all the plants are tagged and tracked all the way through cultivation to harvesting from dry and trim coming up with a cultivation batch that you weigh what's actually been harvested and then you have to account for how that moves through the facility all the way to the point-of-sale so at the end of the day everything that's gone out the door can be tracked all the way back up to an individual plant that started 12 weeks before the sale so this is our propagation room and what we do here is we've started our seeds back in August and we've grown all our mother plants out here and about every two weeks we come in and we take a cutting off of these plants and we put them into these cloners over here to grow roots these are just taken so they don't have any roots on them right now and then about five to seven days they will grow roots once they have roots we will put them into rock wool which is over here these are just planted into the rock wool cubes just a few days ago right out of the cloners so in about a week or so two weeks maybe we'll get roots out the bottom the plant will grow up to this point after this stage once they get up to the size that we want in our propagation room the plants are actually under 18 hours of light here six hours of darkness it keeps them in a constant vegetable into flower in this room and once we feel that they're large enough to go in the flower we bring them in to the next stage which is in the next room we want to go in there [Music] so this is one of our flowering rooms we have for flowering rooms at this point so what we're trying to do is we have an eight week cycle for flowering and every two weeks we're trying to plant grow for eight weeks and then harvest so every two weeks one of these rooms is being harvested of the four so what we what you saw back in propagation where the rockwool cubes with the little plants we bring them right in and we put them down in these trays their growth roots grow right through and everything fed from underneath hydroponically we also have a soil room but predominantly right now we're growing hydroponically my name is Ethan abacus I'm the head grower here at Triple M I guess I'm kind of in charge of overseeing all aspects of cultivation from seedling stage all the way up till it's packaged for for purchase like after the plant is grown we kind of pick the harvest time you know so we can choose to harvest it a little bit early to give it more of an up higher we can choose to let it go a little bit longer harvest late which will give it a more of a sedative kind of feel to it so we can kind of choose what way a plant is going to affect you based on harvest times as well as genetics but so once it's cut down we break it up into chunks that allow for a more even dry we take off all the big fan leaves and then we hang it up and we let it dry for about ten days to two weeks and then we take it down and we trim it further we remove kind of all the little leaves that have trichomes and crystals on it really maximize the amount of trichomes are on that bud before it's sold and then once we trim it down we put it in two containers that control the humidity kind of like cigar as you wanted that like a perfect humidity you don't want it too wet because it'll you'll get mold to dry and it's a little bit of a rough smoke so we try to control exactly where that humidity is and it stays in those containers right up until the day that it gets packaged which is usually no longer than a week before it gets sold we try to really keep them in the larger but bins and control that humidity before it gets packaged for sale there's there's a lot of science that goes into particularly the processing aspect of it so so Keith who you met who's the director of processing he has two different extraction methods that he uses one is solvent list which were really exciting about that's with a rosin press so just through the application of heat he did steel plates and applying an incredible amount of tonnage you can actually have the oil from the cannabis mousse out and that in and of itself is a concentrate it's a rosin we sell three different types of it and it's amazing because it's pure cannabis oil no solvents are used but the amount of science that has to go into that too for he actually created the machine or he extrapolated from what was currently a market where you could do one bud at a time and he's extrapolated that out so that he can do 14 buds at a time it was just an incredible efficiency what happens in here is we make nonsmoker bowl applications of cannabis teachers which go into your tongue for capsules which eat or topical creams and we're also now making lozenges for people that it also goes through your tongue and three of your cheeks we do that by extracting the resins from the plant and then process them in such a way that we can add them to these various applications and all the products that we make in here in general we make in three categories three types of the same capsules tinctures or or vape pens we make a THC one we make a CBD one and we make up what's called what we call a one-to-one which is half-and-half but we we're currently offering nine different final medical marijuana products for our patients and each one of those products is either THC dominant a CBD dominant or one-to-one profile and as a patient it all depends on what you need and why that would be important for you two to have one of those options so THC just in terms of general overview is the the psychotropic the psychoactive cannabinoid component and that's what gives patients a high from a medicinal perspective what patients have reported is that it's helped them with relaxation with reducing stress with taking down anxiety stimulating appetite reducing pain CBD conversely is actually non psychoactive there's no high to it but patients have actually reported as well that they've received benefits of relaxation more of a body relaxation it's been shown to have anti-inflammatory components aunty spasticity there's a lot of anecdotal evidence that's coming out that potentially that it has neuro protective components to it all of our products are offered in a 1 to 1 ratio which as it suggests it's an equal or close to equal ratio of THC and CBD but on a lower level than if you were to have a THC dominant strain you would perhaps want to be having something in the high teens or of a percentage or 20s or maybe even 30% when you're having a one-to-one like the strain that we're growing here called triple Medi haze it's just about 7% THC and 7% CBD so the interesting thing about that is that you're not although there was a psychoactive component to it it's not something that's going to impair you significantly and people who might benefit from something like that would be somebody who would who may be someone who take some kind of Tylenol PM so there's some aches and pains that they also have a little difficulty getting to sleep instead of taking a pill that impacts your liver every night you might want to try a one to one ratio and see how that impacts use [Music] so I think triple m stands out because we have made a very focused viewpoint of creating true medicine so we offer all the products in the THC the CBD the one to one we have the whole plant extract because we're looking for the entourage effect not just delivering the distillate the cannabinoid aspect to it but making sure that the patient has a whole experience where we're supported our investors are primarily physicians and they gave us the direction of we want this to be a very medicinal approach we're so excited to come to mash be a there's such a need and interest and over maybe thirty five percent of the patients that are coming to Plymouth right now are actually from the Cape and I know that everyone I have relatives that live in the Cape and they'll be so happy not to have to come over the bridge a lot of people look at the location of Mashpee and see it fenced in a guard house but that's what at the time Rodney Collins was the police chief and the selectmen and the police chief said we didn't want you know access we're young adolescents could be skateboarding through the parking lot or putting graffiti out there or asking people to buy product for them so that's why it's fenced in the guard house no one can get on that property in Mashpee unless they have a medical marijuana card or guests to the facility for some some reason the product will be moved from this location here in Plymouth it will be sold from there and then will reload will replenish the inventory as needed and we feel that this location and facility is very secure you know Mashpee was willing to allow us to come into their community we're guests I mean that's why we have Jim Vacarro Mary LeClair on board so the town people know that they have local representation if there's any problems we feel that the zone that they put us in you know being a dead end light industrial or heavy industrial in some regards in that location we won't be a problem for the community in any way shape or form the good news is we're the 22nd dispensary to open and from all we know from our security personnel and from reading the newspapers and talking to other people my counterparts is that there haven't been any security issues at those facilities so I think Mashpee was right and Plymouth was right to make us go well and beyond what's needed because it was so new and they were taking a leap of faith with us and I think that the level of security I think makes the patient feel safe that when there I'm here to make a transaction and leaving here with medical marijuana they feel very safe than doing so I worked as a registered nurse primarily for the geriatric population and I found over the last year and a half that there were many patients coming in inquiring about becoming a patient or that they were using the product and wanted to start tapering their pharmaceuticals it's a safe much safer alternative for them especially the geriatric population as general manager of the Mashpee location my primary goal there is to make sure that the staff is very knowledgeable and able to educate everyone coming in if they're a first time patient or if someone that has been using the product for several years as it's important to always be keeping track of what it is that you're treating and how effective its it is for them because change is needed at some times when people come in to visit the dispensary for the first time they're pleasantly surprised by what they're what they're seeing a lot of them are not expecting it to be such a clean well-lit environment it's very welcoming all the employees are very welcoming to the patients it's just a really pleasant experience for a first-time patient to come into a facility as nicely done as we have done here I have recommended family members my mom included who's turning 80 next year to treat her arthritis she is a stage-four cancer survivor she really is so interested in this and she's pursuing getting her card hopefully the benefits of it medically will far out see the perceived benefits of cannabis as just a way of getting high and because it goes well beyond that and the difference in products between what a medical Asian takes and what a recreational patient takes is really no different and we've created product here as Liam will talk about that allows someone not to get just high but also get the medical benefits of it and that's really been our mission but I think five years from now it's going to be much more mainstream I think towns will feel much more comfortable once they see how it's rolled out in their town either on a medical level or recreational and that'll give people comfort that this is not reefer madness that there is going to be as an acceptable social experience I can certainly four see this replacing pharmaceuticals in the future even something as common as Tylenol and Advil [Music] you [Music]
1iIENII-lVo,THC vs CBD: What&#39;s In Your Weed?,2018-11-08T17:00:00Z,everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea

hzGnJ2vA2Zg,The international crime syndicates running multi-million-dollar cannabis businesses in the suburbs,2018-07-02T03:34:52Z,"place one over the door what you're saying is police seizing cannabis plants from a Gras house a modest home in a residential street where hundreds of thousands of dollars of marijuana was being grown this type of houses are not your everyday mum and dad's growing a couple of plants these are backed by organized criminal syndicates this police operation is only targeting grow houses in southwestern Sydney but since 2011 it is rated over 570 properties and seized more than 70,000 plants I don't know whether we actually make a dent into it or not because we could we could be disrupting one here today and another four or five could be popping up the drug syndicate stays place the targeting are doing big business and police say it's not just about cannabis the cannabis grow houses the profits they make from there can fuel you know other illegal activities and that could mean in putting and other drugs through the border manufacturing other drugs including ice that's the potential danger a house like this one can yield over a million dollars a year in cash a single grow earns a quarter of a million dollars and multiple growers are cycled throughout the year any given house will contain seedlings such as these as well as rooms full of clients but ahead of the shindig at the top level in one operation depending on how many grow houses they've got they have a potential of you know tens of millions of dollars in profit in the hands of organized crime a typical grow house will have its windows blacked out to hide the high-intensity lighting inside the ventilation systems transfers the heat and smell of the plants upwards and away from the neighbors while a network of hoses are usually connected to the bathroom to water the plants so how does a criminal syndicate keep one of these houses from being detected well they don't houses are frequently detected when energy providers notice excessive power use on a street with no apparent user the lighting in a hydroponic setup like this choirs a lot of power which syndicates managed to steal by rewiring a grow house to bypass the meter and it's dangerous inside too when you've got crops and generators within rooves of particularly old weather board buildings out in the southwest potential of fire the potential of being electrocuted you've got water irrigation systems running all over the floor you're walking into a death trap the profits are so great and when a grow house is raided the losses were simply absorbed where you've got so potentially 20 grow houses running at once if you lose one or two for free it's not a huge dent in the profit a typical grow organization is structured in three tiers so the higher-ups can evade detection syndicate heads can collect the most revenue from a cannabis grow operation without ever setting foot in a grow house that's because below them are facilitators responsible for sourcing properties and providing equipment they're electricians plumbers real estate agents or loan brokers with the right connections to establish a profitable grow house they are also a layer of cover between a syndicate head and the crops eaters at the bottom of the tree it's the crops eaters job to leave in and provide security for the house as well as to maintain a crop and harvest it once it's grown most crop sitters are found to be unlawful non-citizens from poor parts of Vietnam lured by the opportunity to make a lot of easy money they usually have no ties to Australia speak very little English and are very easily replaced which makes them attractive to syndicates the organized crime tentacles they can reach back home for them where they have got families you know the threat of violence to their families often make them very very scared to speak to the police this is what back home looks like many crops udders are from poorer provinces such as high form and they are for a young Vietnamese person such as swung very UE there was too much money to say no to just a same guy he come to he come to have it let's just clean up with the house and then he pay me from what later - what up - tree and that's it he was 25 years old when he was arrested at a grow house in Melbourne and deported there are hundreds more crops it is likely some arriving unfortunate business and police want a whole-of-government response to the issue it's huge it's a massive drain on our resources many work impact behind it that could be better used somewhere else as well"
wStNGJ9VX78,Why weed isn&#39;t legal in Australia,2018-05-12T10:14:36Z,hmm I needed that this is why we doesn't leave in Australia I'm not gonna waste my time expanding how awesome I think weed is I'm just gonna explain why I think it's not done yeah even though America Canada Israel Spain Portugal seem to be pushing it through quite nicely even North Korea North Korea you can smoke weed legally here in Australia we're still just just waiting so this is just my opinion on why it's not quite legal here I might be wrong on a lot of these points and in that case you can take your own time too right make a film edit it and posted it first up I hear mentioned a lot of our heads of state have possibly invested or have light connections should we say with big pharma companies wink wink nudge nudge which means that they have invested money or have been lent money by a big pharmaceutical companies that would want them to be quite lenient towards the idea of not legalizing any medicine that you could possibly grow yourself Big Pharma is such a big industry that it's really not hard to see how you can get blinded by all of the money I mean if I had invested in a massive evil invisible cash cow that sells drugs to people while training other people to prescribe more of these drugs not only would it makes money it would virtually in Jack you late money into the air like filth and corruptions and that unfortunately is where a lot of our head of states are just standing under this showering stream of steaming doodle and money unfortunately the irony isn't lost on me the drugs that are prescribed by most of these by big pharmaceutical companies don't really work or have side effects that that nasty most people would rather start doing heroin for breakfast awesome heroin now I know this may tickle your angry bone do you just got to [ __ ] deal with it politicians weren't actually contemplate legalizing it when one of their own people is ill so it's not until themselves their children a relative or close friend of theirs if they have any is literally affected by a disease that can only be cured and/or relief by cannabis or one of its derivatives don't try some chemo chemo no you know what some maybe should Google brick simpson silly-billy money doesn't cure cancer cannabis does the prison unions are another one that could stand to suffer a wee bit from the legalization of cannabis because their investors might stand to lose a bit once they realize that most of their regular customers are not coming back to their find rehabilitation centers a lot of employment would go down the drain and where else could some crazy sadistic prison guard go to bully and overpower and stand over people for a living oh wait that's right yes they could join the police force but hold on a second if we legalize pot that means that a lot of the people that the police force are playing around with at the moment they won't actually qualify for judiciary readjustments anymore because if weed legal then they're not criminals anymore see to have to deal with them and you'd literally have to go and fight a real crime like cyber fraud murder sexual abuse pineapple on pizza this goes on one more find customer that might be affected by the legalization of cannabis is clearly the people that have invested recently in the alcohol and tobacco companies now cannabis kicked in fear and if you were to take these people just offer them a grand have freshly grown Australian weed I'm pretty sure not all of them would take it but a handful of them would take it they'd behave better you know they wouldn't end up in so much [ __ ] trouble to me it just seems that we'd end up with a lot less incarceration and violence and I'm pretty sure a lot of people agree with me I think him right I think I'm pretty [ __ ] right on this one I'm pretty sure I'm right on this one yeah I'm right I'm definitely right there all the main points I wanted to make most of these examples come back to really the people in control choosing wealth over health until of course they're with us next to us in the waiting room crying into a [ __ ] bag of their prescription medicines how did we get here now [ __ ] it hurt us why can't I get a pain medication that works oh that's right because I lobbied against it when I had a chance to make a difference it's Australia 2018 welcome we have pharmacies and formal shops on every corner legalized weed Australia it's well beyond time can follow me on social media Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube for comment like share

1ICp8krCN8s,Callie Blackwell Is Campaigning to Make Medical Cannabis Legal | Loose Women,2018-03-09T08:31:48Z,would you officer you want to campaign to legalize cannabis because you don't want somebody else to go through this haven't secretly and worrying about your children being taken away what happens now you who you campaigning with well I was down at Parliament last week wherein people Flynn asked for a bill to be put forward which actually did go through which is fantastic news and then I think that's being reread in February what I really really want is for this to be an option might be the very beginning and a last-ditch attempt which it is for most people because of the illegality of it you know I want people like your sister it should have been there right at the beginning even if it's not a cure-all for cancer which it does it does kill cancer cells and I do know the science behind it but to help alleviate the suffering that comes with the chemotherapy it's fantastic and for palliative care there is nothing better you know what I saw is him was it took him off the morphine it took him off the cycles in it to come off some fentanyl it took him off some other drugs that were giving him the death that he didn't want and I and and what I saw was cannabis gave him the death that he wanted which she does confers medicine it's it's an amazing story the boy in seven-billion sitting there looking very healthy and smiling and we just must make clear again that obviously using and buying cannabis is illegal and it isn't proven at all that it does cure cancer in any way and but this is your story thank you very much it's very long [Applause]
Sq_Lnf8hDfY,Cannabis oil is used for several medical conditions legally here in Georgia.,2018-01-30T11:21:47Z,thousands of people right here in Georgia can legally have it but none of them can legally get it we are expecting a new debate over medical marijuana will begin soon at the state capital and Jennifer Leslie joins me now so Jen what do we know about this new bill that deals with both cultivation and distribution well those are the two components that are missing from Georgia law as it stands now it went into effect two years ago the Georgia law there was a forum at Emory University last night led by the Macon lawmaker who's been out in front on this from day one right now there are thirty four hundred patients adults and children who are registered in Georgia and legally allowed to use cannabis oil for one of 15 qualifying medical conditions as long as the THC level or the potency is less than 5% but in order to get the oil they have to cross state lines and bring it back or try to ship it here both of which violate federal law that's why state representative Allen Peake is pushing a bill that would legalize the production and distribution of medical cannabis in Georgia we believe we can put the proper restrictions on it properly regulated to make sure that we don't go down the slippery slope of decriminalization but we provide access to medical cannabis oil so those who have legitimate debilitating illnesses and access is the key word here and this is not the first time he's pushed for this right no this bill was actually introduced last March did not get any traction really so he is hoping for a different outcome this year all right so joining us now to add some perspective to all of this this Sebastian cot co-founder of Georgia Hope thanks for joining us this morning Sebastian I know that you were at this forum at Emory you presented as well and your group this parent group Georgia's hope played a key part in getting medical cannabis passed in Georgia this is a personal issue for you as your son is in need of cannabis oil and is on this list is registered list correct correct so are you hopeful with the the conversation that's happening now and the push happening now in Georgia to make it accessible because right now you can't even get this here in Georgia yeah right now you cannot get it legally so it's very challenging it's very difficult I don't know if hopeful is the right word because it's very very complex yeah we started this in at the end of 2013 so it's been it's been a long time and we actually had to move to Colorado my family and I moved to Colorado for 13 months just to have access to cannabis because he was helping my son so much I think it's confusing that these people who are registered can use it they can possess it but how do they get it if you are not allowed to if nobody is allowed to cultivate it meaning grow it or distribute it in Georgia how do parents get it any patience well you can get a some of it to the mail if he has a very low level of THC but that's not enough for the majority of people so what the majority of people end up needing is he legal to ship it's illegal to grow over here so you gotta be very creative and you have to kind of do what you have to do but none of those solutions are good and none of them are legal so what happens now what's the next step here so the next step is we have a bill we have two bills this session but one of them the main one is HB 645 and VY will allowed in-state cultivation and distribution which we really need we really need that access so that's a bill that we are pushing with state Rep Allen pick this session okay can we just quickly just talk about your son Jagger he has a mitochondrial disease which includes a number of health issues including seizures he has lived long past the age in which doctor said he would live he's seven years old correct how is he doing well right now he's in the ICU so he's not doing too good today yeah that metaphor of pneumonia but he's doing good with the cannabis we help reduce his seizures dramatically and his pain a lot we were able to get him off some of the opioids when he was taking by you just using some THC oil so we're very happy about that and he really gave him is giving him still today a much better quality of life all right Sebastian we wish Jagger well as he's recovering in a hospital you and your family well thank you all right Sebastian thank you so much let's turn it to Chesley now it's

11GeNIFXMJY,"Medical cannabis is on the rise – but does it work? | Epilepsy, Chronic Pain &amp; Sleep",2019-05-12T09:00:01Z,"[Music] more Australians are using medicinal cannabis and ever before we know this because more than 3000 scripts were approved last year by the Therapeutic Goods Administration medicinal cannabis isn't easy to access and it can be very expensive so the people who use illegally well they're just the tip of the iceberg it's thought as many as 100,000 Australians self-medicate illegally for everything from back pain to sleep problems getting access to pain relief is of course a good thing but when it comes to the evidence for medicinal cannabis well the picture is mixed there's still a lot that we don't know so far research into cannabis has been difficult partly because it's still illegal in many places but also because of how complex the cannabis plant is cannabis contains more than 400 bioactive molecules about 100 of which are cannabinoids it's thought that these cannabinoids tap into one of the human body's natural systems the endocannabinoid system there are two cannabinoids that you've probably heard of THC or tetra hydro tetra hydro hydro can I do that into tetrahydrocannabinol or THC and cannabidiol or CBD THC is no important psychoactive effects it's the thing that's so high CBD doesn't but both are thought to have therapeutic effects different cannabis strains contain different ratios of THC to CBD and when you add that to the different ways cannabis can be consumed the various types of products available the different doses and research methods used it means that clinical trials have vary a lot in 2017 Australian researchers did a systematic review that's like the gold standard for evidence and they found that on the whole the evidence for medicinal cannabis is limited and it should only be used when registered medicines have been unsuccessful so what is the evidence the strongest case for its use is with children and young people with drug-resistant epilepsy CBD products have been shown to reduce the frequency of seizures by up to 50% or more in up to half of pediatric patients the evidence for its using chronic pain is a little more contested a large US study in 2017 found substantial evidence that cannabis containing both CBD and THC could effectively treat chronic pain but Australian researchers have found that the effect is likely to be modest when it comes to the relaxing qualities of cannabis well there is some evidence that medicinal products can help to improve people's sleep but a lot more research is needed and that goes for nearly all conditions which is why there are a number of clinical trials underway here in Australia and around the world what's your experience are you taking which is not kind of this leave us a comment below or subscribe by clicking here and cabinet camp cannabis kind of cannabidiol cannabidiol"

3AFgI1Giqws,Olivia Newton John on her medical marijuana use | TODAY Show Australia,2019-05-27T03:07:38Z,now it's an issue that always attracts very heated debate not just here in Australia but right around the world that all of medicinal cannabis what's its purpose and how can it actually help people for many suffering debilitating pain and illness medicinal cannabis can be life-changing and now a new Australian documentary featuring olivia newton-john and her husband John eastling digs deep into the trials and tribulations of not just accessing it but using it it follows the journey of brain tumor patients might Gallaher cannabis has been used for thousands of years UNIDO cannabinoid receptor sites on practically every cell in our body I was diagnosed with a brain tumor the kind of brain tumor that will send me blind I had metastasized breast cancer and I'm going through my third bout with it and I reduced all cannabis means so important when I went through my cancer recurrence I was lucky enough that John was able to grow me my own little strains to help with my pain and discomfort and help with my sleep and it's been a total blessing I absolutely believe all patients should have the right to try I mean it's a matter of common sense and it's a compassionate thing to do to people I'll tell you what it's a very powerful doc oh and John Easterling joins us now from Santa Barbara this morning and here in the studio Mike himself as well as advocate of this issue Luci has some good morning to you all thank you so much for joining us John we'll go to you first we heard there just how much medicinal cannabis has helped Olivia herself explain to us the difference it is made to her in the battle that she's going through with cancer at the moment it was made an extraordinary difference and to be to be sure right up front I would say cannabis is not at not a cure-all but it is an extraordinarily important botanical with a multitude of benefit and Olivia was fortunate to have a great team of practitioners and doctors right there at the Olivia newton-john cancer Wellness Center where she received first-class treatment and once we got back to California here about five months ago then I was able to access a whole variety of medicinal botanicals that I traditionally use and one of those is medicinal cannabis for her and really relieved the pain and if you look at the studies on cannabis you'll see a broad spectrum of uses across the board not not just with with cancer or what cancer related pain but you're looking at MS Alzheimer's Parkinson's dementia the the seizures you know all the chronic pain issues an extraordinary botanical with a wonderful safety profile and it's just heartbreaking to me that in Australia you really don't have easy legal access you've got you've got easy access to I mean the cannabis is a big industry in Australia but why the regulatory authorities keep it so restricted is is difficult for me to place in a in a box of compassion and common sense so Olivia's doing extraordinarily well we just got back from the Bahamas swimming boating this really is a very very impressive story with Olivia that is wonderful to know Mike you're the face of this documentary that we just saw a snippet of and and you you took it upon yourself to educate yourself didn't you about medicinal cannabis in your case because of a brain tumor that's affecting your vision I'm just wondering what was the the biggest misconception that you came across as you traveled around the country I suppose a lot of people really don't know much about medicinal cannabis per se as to exactly what it is what they I suppose I have that image of you know people smoking and it's it's actually a range of products these days and a range of medicines that are available but there's you know there's there's quite a range of things available for patients now that are that can treat a whole range of ailments and illnesses and Lucy you've been advocating very strongly and strongly on this issue for four years now most notably in the in the wake of your son's death from bowel cancer is the red tape issue the big frustration that John mentioned for you well the red tape is definitely an issue but it's really the system that's the issue we've adopted entirely the wrong system so we've put cannabis into a regulatory limbo so it's an approved unapproved medicine it's never going to be able to be subsidised on the PBS because it can't be listed on the AR TG and hence we're getting problems now with patients that are able to get a prescription they can't afford to fill the prescription so it's actually cheaper safer but not safer cheaper and quicker and easier to go to the black market and you know then the legalities that's right so they're prepared to criminalize themselves for the relief that they're getting and what you know what I'm saying to the government is you need to recognize this this is poor public health policy if you are in fact driving people to the illicit market which is what is happening and they won't recognize it John in in many states of the US you streets ahead of Australia on that front just explain what Australia needs to know and the difference it is making to so many suffers in the u.s. well like what Australia needs to know is is just look at the look at the data look at the information that's available look at where the rest of the world is on this issue and look at Canada look at America look at Israel you're right I mean I'm not sure why all Australia is so far behind I don't know if it's intentional ignorance or arrogance or you know we just got a drop down to place a common sense compassion you can look at regulatory frameworks in America you mentioned earlier in the show I think that it continues to be a controversial subject around the world there's no controversy around it in California here or Oregon or Nevada or you know Washington or Maine or Massachusetts you know if you're if you're 21 you can go into a dispensary you've got full access of a broad range of material it's very competitively priced and there's you know very knowledgeable people to explain that to you so from a safety profile it's proven in the literature there's thousands of studies on cannabis so from a regulatory standpoint in Australia I think it's just time for the sake of all the people in Australia for all the Australians it's a freedom of choice issue and an issue of there's a lot of benefit to cannabis that they look at the regulatory framework in Canada or any one of a number of states and just begin to overlay it like that provide the easy access well it's a powerful message and the documentary itself is so strong and we wish you all the best in your health journey and we thank you all for joining us too to shine a light on the issue here this morning thank you thank you all very much indeed you

on iTunes and thank you for sharing all of the episodes because we've just done it we've reached 100 episodes is absolutely friggin huge you're like the Don Bradman of podcasters it is so good so thank you very much thank you very much to our podcast friends at BSG they've given us this amazing road class a server-based podcast board it's incredible and today on the show I would like to welcome someone who is spreading the good word something that is very near and dear to my heart it sounds like I'm about to give a religious message but I'm not but it's it's kind of like a religion because it does so much research and study on because I know how this stuff can help people but there's a few government roadblocks happening and that's where we need your help it's Jason Jordan ladies and gentlemen from medical cannabis research Australia thank you very much welcome to on the mic nice to be here touring around Australia and around the globe telling people about medicinal cannabis and that's what we're going to talk about today how it can help Alzheimer's how it can help people with cancer with ms/ms cementum Parkinson's so much all stuff things and people from all over the place I love his story I've seen it online I've heard you on on interviews I've seen you on interviews online and I love what you're doing in the medical cannabis space and for people that don't know my dad's at cancer for like nine years and and the CBD oil and the resin has really helped him so I want to talk to you about that I want to talk to you about how you got involved you know how you had MS and it's helped you get off a lot of your meds and and what you do traveling around Australia and and breaking a lot of the the psyche that there is around medicinal cannabis this is the stigma where people just sort of like even my dad when I told him he should do it in cancer like I'm not doing the Y key tabacky yeah beat stoned up but not all the time used to work on the radio and those this guy called Georgia and midnight the dawn who's always wasted he put a pie in the record player once by accident so yes I know I know what you mean by the this this stigma that's going along with it but firstly where are you from and and how the hell did this all come about oh it's a very long story but I'll give you the Reader's Digest version all right so I'm based in Perth I built an IT company over a period of time it got relatively big yeah and then my MS came along multiple sclerosis and it got worse and worse and worse to the point where I'd become I would argue quite disabled and at that point I basically had to let the company go how disabled were you I get a wheelchair disabled I was on a walking stick gotten to the point where a lot of brain fog a lot of confusion all the time short-term memory loss and inability to find my words and in fact an inability to speak clearly incontinence you know all of the things that go with multiple sclerosis even to the point of having bizarre sensory experiences so you know you'd go cross-eyed or you'd get paralysis in one half of your face or your feet would feel like they were burning or they were in a bucket of ice and it was progressively getting worse and worse and so getting on to the medicinal cannabis stopped all those things from happening or like if you have other meds that you're doing with it so at that point you take a lot of medicine when you're when you're not you and you've got multiple sclerosis yeah and unfortunately I mean you're on painkillers and you're well it's all sorts of stuff but all of them horrible and some of them are toxic and some of them you can't possibly think of overdosing on because it could kill you yeah so I've gotten to the point where my neurologist basically said to me Jason we've come to the point where we've run out of options you're just gonna get worse from now on there is an experimental medication you can try however there is a small side effect possible massive brain infection or medical cannabis and I think that was the the good choice going in a medic well I was much like everybody else you know I thought cannabis was a gateway drug and it was a bad thing and no I wasn't interested straightaway but I heard the opposite that it's the opposite of a gateway drug the moment that I started doing my research I realized that we'd all been lied to all of our lives wine like to look historically we can go back and we can look the racist politics of America back in the 30s and 40s and Henry Anslinger who was like really involved in creating this new legislation that basically was focused on making the black man in America and Mexicans for that matter looked like they were responsible for all of the wrongs of the country right and so they were able to look at cannabis or as they called it at the time marijuana which is not a slang term a pejorative and they basically turned it into a demon drug and but was that because the pharmaceutical companies are lobbying to the the politicians and giving them money so that that they only push the drugs that they can synthesize rather than something that you could grow in your backyard that's a weed called weed back then that wasn't the case back then the reason for doing it wasn't just the politics of it but it was oil it was all to do with oil how is it so Henry Ford actually came along and he built a car completely out of hemp because turned into plastic hemp can be turned into all manner of wonderful thing our houses in Margaret River that are built out of hemp it's just amazing what yes I never knew that it's incredible it's like the mud stuff that you see but so you can go the Margaret River have a nice bottle of wine and then start smoking your house do you mean just one bottle of wine anyway so they built this car out of him chemically everything about it was built from him yeah and even the fuel that it was using was made from him mm-hmm and I can't remember the exact phrasing that he used but he said why would you go and dig up fossil fuels out of the ground but have taken millions of years to accumulate when you can grow stuff in a field of hemp build a car fuel it and then regrow it again as you need it it was kind of very early sense of renewables yeah it makes complete sense and why didn't they remember that because the big oil companies at that point we're kind of local hang on we're making too much money out of this whole oil thing mm-hmm we don't want him to come along let's find a way of getting rid of it now of course that's hemp but hemp is basically the same plant as cannabis the only difference is is that hemp doesn't have the battle the flower with the properties that you know a lot of people appreciate yeah I guess the the key to all of this now is because of that policy and because America has such an influence over the United Nations and therefore other countries around the world everybody signed up to just copies the Yanks exactly right and because they banned it pretty much everybody else had to ban it as well yeah and so of course the story follows along that if you've been something there's gonna be a reason for it or here's a really good reason for it and so we've ended up in this situation where we think it's a bad thing but in actual fact we know that it's not I didn't even know that there was a leaf on it [ __ ] I didn't when I put we were walking through Heathrow Airport yeah and I saw myself in a mirror and I win holy [ __ ] I can't be wearing this going through customs you have a massive marijuana leaf on your shirt speaking of taking things through customs a friend of mine the other day had some CBD oil in their toiletries bag and got busted coming into Australia what do you think happened they probably just took it off him and slap him on the wrist that's all they did hey hey he thought he was going to jail yeah which is funny because in actual fact in Australia CBD is considered in the same category as cocaine and heroin and LSD and ecstasy no way it is in the same category so he could have potentially got in a lot of trouble but I think because it's legal here in so many countries in the UK this tastes like a food supplement and you can buy it over the counter right let me tell you a story about when I first went onto the medical cannabis know I was the first patient in Western Australia to get prescribed medical cannabis for multiple sclerosis huh so the TGA the Therapeutic Goods Administration this is the body that basically approves doctors when they want to prescribe an unregulated medicine or yeah an experimental medicine if you want to call it that they sent me a letter and said mr. Jordan we don't know what the correct dosage is for you so what we would like for you to do is to experiment with going up and going down with the dosage and see what the optimum dose they wanted to use you as a guinea pig they wanted me to guinea pig or myself now I ask you how many other government bodies around the world would say in reference to a medication here's some medication that we don't know a lot of feel free to experiment see how you go that's really weird is that's almost criminal know what it tells us is that they know full well that this is a safe medicine yeah as an example they found residue of cannabis and seeds in the sarcophagi of mummies right now that means that you know you're going back now 10 to 11,000 years hmm if your human race has been using it for at least that long if there was any definitive evidence that cannabis was dangerous we'd have it by now yeah yeah exactly you know if it was going to make people grow an extra leg or something growing out of their forehead or something like that it would happen by now so we know that this stuff is safe so what why is it still banned is it just because of the u.s. we're following the US but things are changing and now the US is legal there I mean that just last week the first marijuana bar just opened the Laurel farms and you saw the videos I've still got a lot more video but I'm still recovering from that day with the make Courtney Dover from The Bachelor we went in there and we we ate all the food we smoked that the lady comes over the the flower waitress yeah and it said bring us your lightweight stuff we both had a drag each of this joint and we were just like yeah but um you know it only lasted probably about 20 minutes and then and then we're back to normal but that's it though this stuff this this medical cannabis this is not just CBD yeah a lot of people think that medical cannabis is just CBD knows not why is this stuff so this stuff here is basically 50/50 THC and CBD oh so that gives you a bit of a trip out advise so but that but that stuff that makes you go trippy then actually is the thing that might help you with your MS or help you with the epileptic feed or cancer for me that's absolutely the case so I've tried CBD only and it didn't have the benefits that I was looking for this 50:50 stuff gave me everything I needed and it's brought me back from being an invalid into being I look I'll never be normal again because my brain is damaged now from the MS and it always will be what do you mean not normal like what what effects do you still have so even to this day I'm still clumsy I've still got balance issues I still get a little bit forgetful I still got some short-term memory problems there are challenges with having multiple sclerosis medical cannabis is not a cure there's no cure for anything yeah what it is it's about treating symptoms and improving quality of life now have you heard about medical cannabis like curing cancer and curing certain things like epilepsy though absolutely but here's the thing outrageous claims require outrageous evidence Yeah right of course and and we don't currently have that we have lots of anymore you need a doctor to be to be paid by a pharmaceutical company to write something that they want in the write for a medical magazine and then you can bring out the drug doesn't that how it works and you know what there's a lot of conspiracy theories like that and I got them all I don't really subscribe to those I think you think they playing your cards right by not subscribing to those being in the position that you're in yeah look that no I've no doubt there's some weight to it and I think there's more of an influence on doctors and whether or not what about the conspiracy theory where you know doctors get points for you know prescribing more radiation or more it's not happened I've no doubt that and they get a you know free holiday or a set of golf clubs or something like that and you know put prescribing this kind of medicine have you seen the movie thank you for not smoking yes you know where they've got the people going around promoting the viagra and give you the whole holidays and there but see using it on themselves you have been a radio announcer yeah yeah did you ever get paid for playing a particular song I got paid not power wings I paid for playing songs but you know you get a bar tab at the local club or it's the cash for commenting the Alan Jones you see yeah oh that reminds me I just want to say a quick hello to my friends at BSG Brisbane sound group I've got this amazing podcast set up if you'd like to start a show people sound like advertising now any audience won't hmm I don't know I haven't really played good no I don't and while we're on the subject of sponsorship right bands right bands as well yeah I mean it's it's true I mean that happens with doctors and happens in a lot of industries where people get kickbacks oh but I guess if you look at it both ways I think that when it comes to people's health though I don't think you should be taking a kickback usually doing the thing that helps a person out the most it's about compassion yeah and as far as I'm and you know what I think to an extent the government has recognized that because that's why the TGA has what they call their compassionate use program that's how this stuff is being approved at the moment because at the moment it's still scheduled as a poison yeah well they have to be careful because there are a lot of snake oil salesmen salesmen out there so there are a lot of snake oil sales I can't today there's a lot of snake oil salesmen out there and they are pushing the most ridiculous stuff like I had a few drinks in a state of my friends place the other night I woke up in the morning he's showing me this documentary on this organization called Genesis 2 and and they're basically charging people 40 bucks for what it is apparently a chemical cleaner and and you have a drop of it in some water every couple of hours and they claim to be able to cure cancer HIV hepatitis malaria like and they've got testimonials in the video and I even I was hungover I'm like yeah that sounds great anyway brings me over a glass of it I have never felt so here's a testimonial for you I had to go and lie in the park for four hours I mean normally with a hangover I can I can work and I'm fine but whatever that [ __ ] was that he gave me no good not good at all okay maybe it works for some people and I'm sorry if it works for you but just be careful because there are a lot of snake oil salesmen out there that are pushing ridiculous let's talk about the snake oil for a moment yes it's a it's one of the main points of conflict in the whole cannabis world at the moment this is legal okay I can get a prescription for this it's expensive yeah and a lot of people are fearful that because it's big pharma it's not it's little farmer that are involved in making this stuff that they think that somehow it's not the real McCoy yeah right okay it is this is full extract so it's like it's it's everything that you wanted to be nothing's been taken out of it and it is not synthetic in any way shape or form this is the real thing okay there are a lot of people out there who do the grow your own thing and what we call compassionate growers yeah these are people who are prepared to make oil man give it to other people or sell it for a very low cost now that's that's entirely up to them it is illegal mmm but that's the choice that an adult can make and I have no issue personally from the medical cannabis research Australia point of view we don't take an official position on this whatsoever but on a personal level adults should be free to ingest whatever they want to ingest yeah but at the same time if you know that this is exactly the same stuff as a guy who's making his backyard but this is made in a lab exactly and it's made under sterile circumstances which is exactly why I and you you know that you're not allowed to get if these people give you something it's got a bit of bacteria in it that makes you sick then you can sue them that's it you can't sue the backyard dude because he's doing it illegally and this is the thing so cannabis is what we call a bio accumulator and so when you plant it it will absorb what's in the soil and it accumulates in the buds which is the bit that we can so a lot of it comes down in the soil because not just the soil yes it's how you fertilize there I've used pesticides if there's mold you know all of this stuff is it's critical for people like me yeah because I've got a compromised health system if you want to call it that I have to be really careful about what I put into my body Yeah right I got afraid you wouldn't think that so much but I made of mine yeah you look great I made of mine Josh from tenna field he grows hemp legally and he's put in for the licenses to grow medicinal cannabis but he says he has the the best soil he thinks then anywhere in the world because for the last 10 years he's been cutting up the buds and putting it into the ground and and because you're not allowed to sell it sure and the soil is amazing I reckon so good for treating people who have no doubt therefore a lot of these compassionate growers what they're making is brilliant mmm perfect and I know some but he's not making anything he's only making him products like the legal stuff nobody get him in trouble there's a lady by the name of Jenny Hallam who's quite known for producing the can and she's just been in court recently yeah she's about to get sentenced for the fact that she's been supplying this stuff right I've no doubt that her product is good and I'm sure she's had it tested she knows that it's it's a good product and it's helping people but ultimately if I as a person with with a poor immune system or a parent of a kid with with epilepsy and I've got a choice between something that a person has made and something that I can buy that is a proper medicine yeah that's been through all of the regulatory processes and the legal whatever if I've got a choice I'm always gonna go this way first and that's not a criticism it's like a liquid or a resin it's an oil and oil because I have seen it's like a thick black resin no no not this one yeah right you know what that all the way well I actually think that's more like hash or hashish yeah right okay and that wouldn't be considered to be medical cannabis Yeah right okay um so in Australia the primary way that it's delivered currently is either as an oil like this or as a capsule generally there's other methods coming through the administration there'll be things like nicotine patches the same sort of thing and we will see other types of capsules we will see what we've already got for example sprays there's a lot of people can't tolerate it though because the base of the spray is an alcohol and you know if you're spraying into your mouth or your nose then it can really affect some people quite bad food so look the thing with medical cannabis is that as we speak today whilst it is legal it's still quite hard to get yeah so how come is so hard to get like can't you just go to the doctors and say hey I really need it or you know I've got some sort of stress you know I've got anxiety or you know I've got cancer give it to me now and you just get a prescription get in and get it you're fighting it with that see because I was at Northern Beaches hospital with my dad the other day and I just said to the girl behind the counter us in do you smoke cannabis here and she's like just let me check she whenever we yeah they got it in like a bad form it's grass that's right inside a little science is another way you can get it yeah not a preferred way because that generally means that you've either got to smoke it or Lape it but it's everywhere so is is it how come it's not easy to get well how can bunch get the prescription oh they're only certain doctors are gonna do it yeah well kinda so here's the problem at the moment each state has slightly different requirements but you also then have to go to the TGA as well so there's a state-based requirement and a federal requirement now thankfully in New South Wales and in Queens now the dependency of a doctor having to speak to another doctor before they can write the prescription that's either going or gone hmm in Western Australia unfortunately if I go and see my GP and he agrees to it he still has to then talk to a specialist and get their approval before he can put the application in an application in yeah that's [ __ ] is a massively getting easier I mean over the last two years I've seen it go from almost impossible to just really who are the people stopping it who are the roadblocks who are they we're all gonna write to them it's get get out to your iPhone now and type in this address in this name it starts with the politicians yeah she's right to the politician which one in particular Oh Greg hunt is probably the main one that we thing Barnaby Joyce is the member for ten afield and I host the Peter Allen festival out there and that's where Josh grows his hand and they got supporting letters saying that backing it a hundred percent yeah about a year ago but now Barnaby's just flipped what the [ __ ] has he flipped what is his problem he's stopping people from being helped he's lost the plot lately Tasmanian farmers used to make a lot of money out of the fact that they were the number one place around the world growing opium poppies yeah the end result of those puppies is opiates so things like codeine now they are dangerous codeine and those sorts of painkillers yeah internals and all that kind of thing not only are they addictive but they've got really bad side effects yeah and you can easily overdose on them and die and opioids a horrible horrible and we have an epidemic of opioid opioid abuse going on at the moment so if we could find a replacement for oh yes that would be brilliant oh my dad's been giving opioids at moment because he's coughing a lot yeah and he could see he's just tripping out on the stand the worst thing is he's gonna get backed up as well what's that mean he's not gonna be able to go to the toilet properly yeah right and and it makes you sick and nauseous that is when when I cuz I broke my collarbone in a bike accident about seven or eight months ago and they gave me the opioids in hospital and I was talking to the nurse and I just projectile vomit while I was talking to her while I was on the [ __ ] and I'm like I don't know what the [ __ ] you're giving me I'm not gonna take that anymore and then I've got some CBD oil and I just took that I could still feel the pain of course but I've got a friend of mine who robbie maddison who's you know the motorcyclist stomps and everything like that he said you know you need to feel a little bit of pain because that way your body knows where to fix otherwise if you just like ah I'm okay yeah your body doesn't know what's wrong anywhere and your immune system can't fix things it's it's the question that I've got about this in the some of the pushback that we've seen around prescribing medical cannabis is or people might get high and I'm like well hang on these are the same people who will go home and drink a bottle of wine mmm all right you're getting drunk yeah no medical benefit to that whatsoever yeah but if I've got someone who is has has cancer or is experiencing chronic pain or something like that and we give them this and it not only helps with their symptoms but it also makes them feel good if that's improving someone's quality of life why would we even question exactly especially when when a doctor says you know you've got six months to live and and it's just gonna go downhill fast and you're gonna be in pain well Holly it's have kids why wouldn't you want it give them as much as they want they're not harming anyone and that's the thing we've talked previously about cannabis being a gateway drug yeah now I've said over and over to people because I do a lot of talks about this and I've had a lot of debates with people about it the only way in which cannabis is currently a gateway drug is that the only way that I can until medical cannabis came along the only way I could get it was to go through the gateway of a dealer now a dealers going to upsell me yes right yeah if I've got this I don't need to see it Theodore I've gone to the pharmacy the pharmacist it's not gonna try and upsell mean hey found this is my vitamin might say hey do you need a toothbrush Abdallah paper two-for-one this week go to the aftershave section we got some lovely new Bulgari why do we talk like this dude is that Obama's pharmacist speak I don't know they just sound like the smarter than us so let me tell you a little bit more about this because this has changed my world okay great I want to hear about it's from Canada I just saw on the line that is from Canada yeah we do have local producers now coming online I am so little green farmer they're coming along in fact there's actually a bunch of them that are about to start selling into the Australian market yeah right she's going to bring the price right down so one of the big arguments I get from people is all this stuff not only is it synthetic rubbish stuff you're paying a stupid amount of money for it mhm the second part is true we are currently paying a stupid amount of especially Swede exactly I mean you can't grow it you should be on the PBS what why wouldn't it be let me get to that number one mmm I can't grow my own because if I was to get caught growing my own I may just get a slap on the wrist yeah but I would from that point forward be prevented from ever having a legal prescription ever again so I can't risk it because I need this stuff yeah you need it absolutely the way it changed my life is that within six weeks of starting to take it and no longer needed my walking stick well that's like that's raising log went away my confusion mostly went away yeah my ability to speak mostly returned I would say in all of these instances probably about a 90% recovery from where I was originally so I'm still disabled I'm still I've still got problems and because it's MS the primary symptoms come and go there'll be some mornings I can't get out of bed and that's still the case and what it what is the feeling when you can't get out of bed it's just like all the vines are hurting or fatigue so fatigue goes well beyond being tired mmm fatigue is it's utter utter exhaustion and it affects you not just physically but mentally as well and so you know people talk about the Black Dog and being depressed and all that fatigue actually feels a lot like being depressed but it's more transitory you know it kind of it'll really only last for one day generally yeah until you get out of it by taking this it helps yeah but it's again it's not a cure-all you know it helps reduce some of the symptoms but that oh can you live out your gears with MS with that absolutely yeah and it will make an enormous difference to my quality of life going forward and more importantly yeah it'll make an enormous difference to my family to my wife and my kids yes I'll be able to be the human Trish so is there a lot of people out there who don't know about this because it's not really marketed yeah it well it's not allowed to be marketed this is [ __ ] so this some person right now who's sitting there who's thinking I got a mess on my watch this video yeah and they've just gone are you freaking kidding me buddy whoever you are get this can ii meant no no no see let's not talk about the brand okay let's talk about the product and that's more important get this you need it met medical cannabis the 10:10 formulation doesn't matter about the brand 10:10 formulation and what is exactly in that 10:10 formula so it's got all of the cannabinoids that are in a cannabis plant so there's about 144 different cannabinoids yeah there's also what we call flavonoids and and terpenes all these different chemicals that are in there yeah that work together in what we call the entourage effect so all of these things work together holistically to give you the benefit you're looking for when you talk about medical cannabis which is an extract so they've taken out just the THC or they just giving you the CBD you've only got one component out of 144 cannabinoids and the other bits and pieces you're not gonna get maximum benefit from that so anytime you're on medical cannabis you want the full extract preferably and you want to know that it's not synthetic in any way shape or form and that's the bulk of the medical cannabis that we're seeing at the moment there are some exceptions there's a product called sativex which is one of the very early medical cannabis treatments um and that is not a full extract product and so have you introduced other people through this and it's changed their lives as well so the main reason I got involved with medical cannabis research Australia is that what it's given to me I want other people to have the opportunity themselves yeah I can't make any promises that it's going to be as beneficial to them as it has been to me because it works differently for different people doesn't it absolutely it does it but so does paracetamol mmm you know when I've got a headache I take two paracetamol goes away when my wife gets a headache and she takes two takes whole box well no no and let me tell you a story about that okay sorry if you took a full box of paracetamol yeah like let's say we're across the table now like we are you take that full box of paintable I'll drink this full bottle of cannabis who would live right exactly I will come and see you in the morning in hospital while you're dying of liver failure yeah and I'll bring my bag of twisties with me because I'm I'm very hungry you know right for me that's that's one of the things I look at with medical cannabis is that the risk profile is so low that said we have a responsibility to continue to do more studies we definitely need more controlled trials we want to be absolutely 100% sure that this product is completely safe but as it stands today we are seeing so many benefits from it for so many people with so little risk it shocks me that we are not seeing a greater increase in the amount of prescriptions that are being approved each month and so how do we change that easy and it's all about people power so let's compare it to what greeter ton Berg's currently doing yeah with the whole climate thing all right regardless of what you think of greater or her politics she has created a revolution that has motivated an entire generation of kids whether they should be in school or not besides the point I guess what I'm talking about is the motivation and the passion that these people have and that's the sort of passion that I'm feeling yeah but about this yeah I feel it too because I've seen it we've got to get people talking about yeah you've got to talk to you GP if your GP says not interested get another GP yeah because there are bees out there who will help you exactly get a second get a third opinion whatever you need to do do it talk to your friends talk to your family write a letter to the editor talk about it on social media yeah push push push push push because there is a stigma attached to cannabis it's wrong and it shouldn't be there but it's there and we can't it's not going to disappear in the short term that stigmas got to go we've got to renormalize it there's not a jurisdiction on earth that has gone from total prohibition of cannabis to total freedom every jurisdiction has had to go through the step of having medical cannabis then making access to medical cannabis easier and then eventually moving into the whole recreational open in a weed cafe and that's down the track yeah but even at that point people will still need medical cannabis yeah do you know what was really funny the other day at the Laurel Farms cafe is the first weed cafe first a little bit of Amsterdam that's opened in LA everyone in there is is chatting away having a great time but it wasn't the same loud screaming chat lis getting a when people have been drinking like having a good old chat yeah like you know when I think about this that is so interesting because in Perth we have a place called North Bridge and North bridges are nightlife district yeah and I've often said to people if you were heading into North Bridge and you've got some people coming out of a club would you rather them have taken too much alcohol or too much cannabis too much cannabis they're not gonna want to start a fight with you okay that's exactly my point and the same thing goes for people at home would you rather someone be abusing alcohol or be abusing cannabis because someone who's abused alcohol may very well also be abusing their family but someone who's abused cannabis is abusing their fridge that's the exactly you know their couch locked generally so who are some of the other people it's helped because obviously ms yeah we touched on cancer but I heard Apple epsy as well here's the real challenge at the moment as far as the TGA is concerned yeah only eligible people at the moment for medical cannabis have it's a very limited number of conditions epilepsy or let's say childhood epilepsy is is one of them chronic pain is the other one multiple sclerosis and there's about four or five of these conditions so not anxiety not yes but the CBD oil does work for anxiety I mean my girlfriend loves it it's amazing yeah yeah not that she has it American America absolutely chronic pain though is it's a really handy one because it's almost a generic anybody can say they've got chronic pain yeah I've got arthritis it's chronic pain you know so that is a way that if you really want to get medical cannabis you can push down that you just go into a car and need your help doctor look at that yeah so if you do want to get hold of it it is possible but you may have to do a little bit of doctor shopping hmm and you're gonna have to pay for it so medical cannabis research Australia our mission ease access so make it easier for people who are legally allowed to have it to get it number two bring the price down because at the moment it's out of reach of most ordinary people it's out of reach for me yeah but I've got no choice you know we have to make sacrifices so that I can don't they throw thousands of dollars a year for these speaking arrangements I don't you built the money you're charging with this podcast appearance come surely you can afford I wish look everybody involved in medical cannabis reaches Australia including all the presenters all of the staff we're all volunteers you're right we do it because our hearts are in the right place and because the cause is just who are these people give them a shout out what do they do whether they come from how they get involved it look it's so important that people who have experienced the benefits whether it be directly through themselves or because they've got a family member or a friend that they've seen their benefits with as soon as you see it you get this incredible motivation to want to make sure that other people get the opportunity yeah and it's one of those you know when your heart fills with pride because you you've seen something and you know that it works and you know it can help someone and you just want to you just so enthusiastic and passionate and earnest about delivering it to someone else I feel that on almost a weekly basis at the moment and that motivates me to continue doing what I'm doing and you know not that I'm bragging about it because it is hard work last week we're in the UK we did lectures in London and Manchester for medical professionals and patients helping them start to renormalize cannabis over there I'm now here in Brisbane to speak at a seminar this weekend back to Perth and then next week I'm back here again to start another round of seminars that's going Brisbane Sydney Melbourne Adelaide Bunbury would you believe so how you keep keep going I mean obviously this little baby else but how do you keep the business going how do you keep getting absolutely to do these talks who funds you we are registered not-for-profit Australian charity so and everything goes to that we get no funding from government we do charge a nominal fee to come to the seminars it's ten bucks so it's it's just enough to make sure that people who are coming actually want to come yeah the way that we actually get the bulk of the funding to help us fly around accommodation hiring the lecture theatres is we get sponsorship from the companies that produce medical cannabis right okay but let me make it very clear right now as I make it experience that's why I don't promote brands yeah if you've ever come to one of our seminars you will see that we do not promote brands we are explicit about this when we talk to these companies they know that they'll benefit purely through the renormalization and the removal of the stigma because then they will sell more but it's not my job to sell their product it's my job to actually say the the medical cannabis is a good thing more people should have the chance to use it help people understand what it does exactly right so these seminars that we do are all about well for medical professionals a different thing talking about the patient's what is medical cannabis how does it work is it right for you what are the risks what are the you know I mean you need to know everything about a medicine before you even bother walking down the path of the air to pursue it if you're gonna pay 220 bucks or more for a month's worth of medicine yeah you need to know that there's going to be value in there hmm really and can you drive after taking this you can't that's why you get your wife driving around everywhere she's driven yeah because how do you how do you how do you handle that though like you're just getting over it everywhere I guess well pretty much but like alcázar so bad if you're if you've taken something that puts you under the in for too much you're gonna can try it you don't drive so there's nothing unusual about yeah that's true again if you are on CBD only then you are safe to drive just the THC moment you've got THC but the front is and this is the frustrating bit like alcohol well-known unlike alcohol if you've drunk too much alcohol and you get tested and you are over 0.05 you're considered to be under the influence and therefore you shouldn't be driving and you will be prosecuted yeah unfortunately with cannabis the THC can stick around in your system for quite a while how long but well potentially weeks depending on the dosages that you've been taking now it's fat soluble it can be absorbed by the fat in your in your body yeah right so it's detectable for quite some time but you can have certain amounts in your blood but not actually be under the influence of it whatsoever you busted if you're driving things maybe you're fine even though you're fine right so what kind of sobriety tests are we gonna have to have in the future and how do the cops to tell you if you're on it like they have tests for the mouth swab or something though THC not for CBD okay so if you're on CBD only you are safe not only is it not dangerous because it's not affecting you psychologically but they could they don't test for it anyway mmm they test for THC so again the recommendation is just don't operate heavy machinery if you've been taken CHC that's good advice I can't believe how many people out there that it is helping already and and the amount of people out there that it could be helping that just confused about it and and what you're doing is going to help so many people I can't thank you enough on behalf of all those people that you've already heard and the people that you're going to help because without you we'd still be stuck in the 1920s and not not being able to give people this amazing medicine that can help them get through so many does a better job than what we've done so Olivia newton-john oh she has a she she's just angry actually got on TV and she's talked about it phenomenal yeah you know here's Australia's good girl hmm who is helping break the stigma of medical cannabis well um Olivia newton-john cancer Wellness Center in Melbourne it was organized with Austin health and back in I think it's 2007 Olivia Newton John and I and Dannii Minogue and Phyllis Diller and Cliff Richard and all these people went to China and we walked along the Great Wall of China to raise money and the government said well we'll match whatever money raised to build a hospital and and she's thinking like you know maybe a small building yeah next thing you know she's raised like 20 million the government comes up in another 44 million and the great thing about that hospital is that they have always been looking at spiritual treatments as well as as well as alternative treatments and it's great that she talks about things that work because she's not influenced by any big pharma exactly right and all those big fat guy called Clive who lives out in tena field that calls our occasionally I heard he's a bit of an influence but she is just an institution for promoting it and and making it the stigma go away like you are so but you know you're putting the long hours we don't take away Olivia newton-john all the credit at the end of the day it is now my responsibility to do what my neurologist did for me and he opened my eyes to something that I you know I just I was blinded to because I've been lied to my whole life like everybody else yeah so now if I have the opportunity to get out there and tell people about what it did for me and also find doctors and other medical professionals who can also come along and tell the truth from a professional point of view that then helps convince other doctors other researchers of a scientist or the nurses other people in the medical community and it influences the patient's themselves who they're know cannabis isn't as bad as I saw actually this is a possibility here that I might actually be able to stop some of the things that I'm on and just take that instead I was previously on seven different medications every day every day Polly farmer they call it once multiple different medications I'm down to two so as soon as you started taking this stuff he kicked off I wouldn't say soon all there listen between yourself off a lot of this stuff you can't just stop instantly but in particular the painkillers they were the first thing that went so that all the opiates gone there's another one called baclofen which I used to take like you I used to get some really bad pain through my cheeks oh and fingertips and toes that's gone tell me about the research side of things because I'm an ambassador for the Charlie T oh oh yeah I host events for him all over Australia hosting the rebel ball next year we raised a million bucks this year for the rubber ball and yeah but lately the smart stuff like the research to people like Charlie T and like he told me in an interview that I've done and you can watch this a few episodes back at on the mic comm he has seen CBD or kill cancer cells in a petri dish yeah absolutely what kind of research have you seen there is heaps of that research going on at the moment here there's a quote that I sometimes and I made this one up so I'm very proud of this one doctors who say that there hasn't been enough research done haven't done their research yes I love that and it's true because the amount of research that has been done not just over the last 50 years primarily out of Israel where it's been you know a medication that they've loved for a long long time yeah totally I was reading some research from the University of Israel where they used CBD oil on mice that had broken famous right have you read that one I have and and so and obviously using microscopy my bones of really tiny they saw that the the poor little mice that had their bones broken treated with the CBD oil it the calluses healed quicker and thicker and harder and so that was what crap coming crazy that was one of the reasons why I decided not to be opioids when I had the bike accident yeah and just take the CBO because it took away the pain but I still feel the pain but I knew my body was knowing where to fix awesome well know that what other research is research going on at the moment anxiety you mentioned before this research happening into that PTSD is is a big one that we're going to see and that's already that's already treating returned vets in America I see and we need to do that here we're not we need to support our troops and this is part of the problem that we've got here is that the Australian government insists that they need to do their own research rather than looking at the research done in other countries which is so frustrating why really is but PTSD dementia Parkinson's in fact a load of different neurological conditions which is probably the main place that we're going to see benefits at least in the short term longer term I think we're actually going to start being able to say it does help with cancer but today I would be very hesitant to go out and make that claim because the last thing I want to do is give people false hope yeah but that said I have heard of situations where it is hoped we're about you just hear these things when you go into it that's what these shows are for I'm not gonna give someone has watched 40 minutes into this show and you say that you can't just leave it up in the air just heard I've met people people like met them they just said no you know I made a lady antenna field because this one my mom believes nothing huh so it sounds like I just hanging out in Tennessee all the time a lady who had stage four breast cancer and her doctor said you know you've got the chemo the radiation just gonna keep doing that that's all I can do you've only got months affiliates yeah she can the chemo can the radiation and she was just doing the high resin CVD within a certain amount of time and I think it was months the cancer was gone yeah she took it to her doctor and and add after the tests and and said listen I don't want you to see this this stuff that I've been taking her cousin she was getting it illegally yeah because I don't have any cancer lifting mine right this is someone I met right this isn't like some video I watched online and I'm thinking ah this this person is trying to sell some [ __ ] yeah and that's where my research started because it was gone and you know what the doctor said he said oh well that's good for you keep doing what you're doing I'll see you later there's nothing you can do and they don't understand anything about it you were just one person and therefore we consider that to be an anecdote that is not data that is not a study it's an anecdote and therefore we're going to discount that entirely do you know and from then I started my own research and I just watched hours and hours of YouTube videos so I was down the rabbit warren oh yeah and when I didn't believe it was when I saw a video with you know hundreds of thousands of years or a million views and they would be talking about a certain kind of CBD oil how it saved them and I thought I don't know if I could believe this because it could be promoted or whatever but when I did believe it when it was and I saw a lot of these just an average punter going hi I just hit record on my camera because I had chronic fatigue or had cancer or had something wrong with me what whatever it might have been and I was doing this this the marijuana this CBD and it helped me and it's gone and I'm okay now I don't know if anyone will see this if they do great and it helps someone Thanks and a lot of those videos had like 30 views 40 views yeah and I'm thinking more that's not something that's put together by that's just it as someone who's not getting anything out of that other than helping pet that is super important and that is something that I think will help bring people over the line to want to try it but I have to give the counter-argument as well just to balance it yeah now I have a good friend who got lung cancer and he was dosing himself up big time on illegal hmm cannabis oil and he still died mm-hmm now I don't want to bring it down on anything but it's important to note that this is not a cure not a cure and it can help but it won't always how did it help him I think it helped reduce some of his pain but I clearly remember hearing from his wife that he was still in a cure but what sort of agony would he have been in had he not been taking the medical cannabis was that a secondary or was it just lung cancer we should know more about it than me was gone yeah yeah yeah well yeah well that's what dad's got bough then then at Trent transferred to the liver the lung hmm I mean you know Parkinson's is obviously something Trish just brought up as well as is that that can help people have you seen the videos I haven't seen the videos of people with Parkinson's tell me about them so one of the big things that we see with Parkinson's is tremor tremor to the point where if they hold a cup of coffee it'll spill yeah and they have Michael J Fox yeah exactly even getting it to their mouth you know and they can have it in a sippy cup but they can knock their teeth you know it's it's not it's not a saying there's a video on YouTube that I'll actually put a link actually I'll if we can put a link or play and really I'll cut it in there's a guy who basically takes a bit of the cannabis and within a couple of minutes he wakes up and he's normal no way absolutely normal what their hell and it's like what politician bureaucrat or doctor could possibly watch that and hand on heart say but you know it's dangerous it's a gateway drug well here's that video the best way to take it is put it on your tongue and rub it and you cheap don't do too much even be asleep all night then you know what you should do no don't try to communicate just relax see what happens experience will relieve of our sentence I think your calm down amazing he used just a single drop and his hands afterwards were rock steady and the dyskinesia left it works most of the time that fits oh did you guys see much oh yeah really easy I wanna yeah basically angry that thank you state so there's also another video of an Australian art who same thing again she takes some cannabis and the next thing as you can see she goes from being someone who is suffering big time into someone who how could you not let people have access to this medicine when it is saving lives like that this is ridiculous people watching this right now thinking okay that's great someone else will do something no we need you to do something even if it's sharing this video even if it's you know going to them your website which is I can give you right now it's MC Raj you making a donation getting involved in some way shape or form educating friends family so so that we would that's the key spreading education it's education over and over because that's how we get rid of stigma that's how we renormalize this education for both doctors and for patients education for everyone because at the moment we still look at cannabis even medical cannabis as being a little bit naughty and I'll give you an example I do some work for a radio station back in Perth mhm I once the station I'm not going to tell you because and there's a reason why I'm not going to tell you even though still could possibly get in trouble for actually saying this on such a popular podcast of course I there's an afternoon presenter who does talk back and we were going to have an interview about medical cannabis she said oh we've got to be a bit careful you best ask the boss so I typed out an email to the boss saying look this is particularly appropriate for the audience of this radio station blah blah blah blah blah he came back and said now don't want to don't want to talk about that on here that's you know that's not something I really think is appropriate for a radio station yeah well he just is uneducated well I don't if I call it that I think it's more a case of you know reputation management or risk management to a certain extent it's wrong because not only that's why radio is dying and television is dying because they're too scared about offending or hurting anyone because they are desperate to hold on to as many viewers and listeners as they can cuz the quiet shut up in so many different areas and that's what's happening the opposite is happening because they're not having an opinion anymore I mean you watch The Today Show it's bland as [ __ ] I mean poor old Tom he's a funny bastard he should be allowed to say and do whatever he wants he's it's funny that funnier than Karl who used to be on the show I watch more YouTube than TV yeah I think thing nice people do but that that's that's exactly the problems and that and this is why I need to talk to you because you should have your own show you should be talking about this kind of stuff every day on your own show people will watch it all over the world people will go here and they'll make donations so you can spread the word it's not hard to do even on your little show that you have one film it and just do you write little like that's the reason why I don't do a radio show anymore because pretty much because I've been fired from every radio station but because I was secret program managers who have failed radio announcers who were jealous of your talent yeah not letting you say or do whatever the [ __ ] you want to do and now I can do what I want to do I can say what I want to do I can speak to someone like you and get to the bottom of the story yeah and not have to it's a quarter past eight Oh where's the joke and here's another song and like I only saw commercials or songs as an interruption in my show I just wanted to talk to people I don't know whether it funny entertaining or informative like I'm speaking to you right now because we're actually helping people so that's why you need to do your own show did they make you play Nickelback I like Nickelback what's wrong with them I got a free t-shirt on it they fired the t-shirt cannon at me I'm sorry I don't like it's the interview over thank you Jason Jordan from medical cannabis Australia doesn't like Nickelback so sorry blue that's he I'll play this little you know Nick Nickelback oh right they take the piss out of himself so you've never been to anywhere Kansai do you like they do I I think just like medical cannabis I was the same as you mmm with Nickelback yeah I really didn't like them I despised them and I had a friend who really want to go and see him had a free ticket was his birthday and I went along oh pretty good peace out themselves they put the paddle pop line photo above the stage because you know he's never late and they're Canadian there's stuff that you're taking from Canada you know again it's legal in Canada you've got a lot in common with Canada I do have to say I I do really like all of Nickelback song can you name any of Nickelback songs song can you name this huh just the one song what is it look at this photograph every time I do it last photograph you know you know the other one this is how you remind me yeah that's that's all I know I think anyway they're great lines I enjoy them very funny name did the transmission vamp I never moved beyond whatever happened a windy James honey I don't care she was so hot so Trish the Palladium 1989 in Northbridge in Perth I was standing directly beneath Wendy James she had this blowing up at her here and I was just like a little miniskirt on a hotel room Wendy she was great that was the era of bras yeah when will I be famous Culture Club yes ma'am yes these only way is up for you bro so you were you're a DJ back then we did it bo-buddies very first have a job in real the job was as a announcer at something at the time called the Eagle which was 1080 a.m. which is at the radio station looking to become an FM stage you know they missed out on its license application and it all it was the very first job I ever got fired from you would you know you know a guy called Brad McNally yeah him so Brad McNally is the only man in the world who's ever fired me twice oh so he fired me from the eagle yeah and more recently he fired me from 96 fm what a bastard bastard did you get over it because that's the nature of crazy I still had a certain disdain for people who fired me Peters he's a voiceover guy he fired me ken sparks not alive anymore you can't fire me because I I was working it too uh Sam and my dad was the breakfast announced yes and he was bagging my dad and the jocks meeting and I told my dad I'm gonna fire that little [ __ ] I he dubbed me who else fired me ya think oh the Sydney Kings basket they fired everyone but that's probably why I don't support the same anymore no one can fire you from this show this is your show hang on I want to use one of my key straight lines let's go let's go man I'd be my government and you've been gold man did you smoke weed before you got sick or just when you got sick with a mess you know just the once okay and it was when I was quite young actually so with my very first job in radio there was a ratings party after they did particularly well one time I was on a stink boat cruising up the Swan River and and all the jocks were upstairs in a semi-circle Henne passing around a joint yeah now I'd never smoked anything in my life as a naive 17 almost 18 year old air they passed it to me and oh what do I do with this I've got no idea so they said you don't just pull a little bit into your mouth and draw those badass jocks from the Eagle back in the 80s I guess yeah now we're teaching you to smoke weed you should be ashamed of yourselves seeing all of them it was just a selection of the naughty ones who named in [Music] so something I've always wondered about if if you smoke cannabis your whole life recreationally and then you get sick with MS or Parkinson's or whatever if you start doing medical cannabis will it still have the same effect will have less effect because you've been doing it before I'm not a medical professional I'm not a doctor I've not got years of training in the field but after seeing what I've seen and being around the people that I've been around and hearing the stories and experiencing it for myself I suspect yes but I've no way of actually proving that but the bottom line is that if you are naive to cannabis altogether that's when you're going to get the biggest effect the meanest feeling of a difference because you've never experienced it but what about your body and actually actually killing or stopping it certain I guess problems the question really then becomes do you adapt to it and do you need more overtime so does your body become used to it I don't believe that's the case I don't believe see your body has something called an endocannabinoid system it's built in humans have evolved alongside cannabis we have a system an inbuilt system that allows the cannabis the cannabinoid molecules to attach to our body what we have an inbuild system that actually works with it is it only working with cannabinoids as work with all sorts of other drugs a common only cannabinoids why would we have evolved endocannabinoid system unless we hadn't evolved a long set goes back to the mummies and having cannabinoids in this road and we meant to I need some now no I don't need you meant to have it if you have a problem or maybe you want to go out and have a little bit of fun rather than having a few drinks you might want to be if it's really easy and you know as I say my organization doesn't have a position on that formally my organization does and you want to relax you want to chill out you got a bit of anxiety go for it as an individual I agree with you but you know it's an organization what we want to do is promote the legal Skrtel ie go as an individual these hard as the business as the company it's a whole I know you have sessions but you've got to it to be professional you know you so how do we change all this because there are people out there who need help there are people there with Parkinson's who are watching this for the first time and they've seen the videos that we've shown people out there who thinking I'm going friends or family or maybe even themselves going through the pain of having cancer or and yeah epilepsy how do we change it is it just to politicians in particular yes let me briefly touch on something that is a very close parallel rina tunberg so whether you agree with her politics are not besides the point what we're talking about here is her ability to mobilize an entire generation of kids of people because of a particular cause people power that is exactly what we need to do we need to tell not just the politicians and the bureaucrats and the medical professionals but also the other sticks in the mud there's a lot of people who have religious objections as well if we can get to all of those people and make them realize that the stigma that is attached to it is wrong and inappropriate and ill-considered that's when we'll start seeing some change happen Mike here's a really interesting statistic greater than ninety two percent of the population support medical cannabis that is a vote winner if you were a politician and you haven't looked at a ninety-two percent approval of a particular thing you're an idiot Barnaby yeah you need a few more of those extra votes bunny you know after the relationship thing and I have met his new missus who used to work in the office and any baby and they're lovely are they and everyone deserves a new start when the old one didn't work that's fine you know everyone deserved you start as well but Barnaby what people also deserve is help they're sick and this is going to help people who are sick so please Barnaby you want to win some votes and want to help people it's time to take another look at this bill this is about compassion and this is about quality of life and I'm not just talking about people like me with multiple sclerosis when you look at kids with epilepsy and when you look at people with dementia and Parkinson's and PTSD medical cannabis can help so many people in so many different interests with PTSD Barnaby it's nice what do you know would you say no we know that the risks are minimal we know the benefits are massive we know the population supports it it's a no-brainer hmm you know if you're in politics you should be smart enough to realize where your votes are going to come from and this is a winner so if you can and you want to help go to Barnaby Joyce's Facebook page and just don't be mean just play nice or Greg hunt for that matter Greg hunts Facebook page maybe share this video maybe just write on there hey there I just want to want to share my thoughts and how it could be good for you and getting some votes and also helping people who are sick even if it's just comes down to talk with your friends and family and stopping the stigma that that marijuana has had from the Cheech and Chong still smoking movies or that it's a really bad evil drug palliative care so people who are dying if we give medical cannabis to them and it makes them feel less bad even for the amount of time that they've got left what's the problem with that why wouldn't why don't know sing howe hall ready give it to these people i mean making their last few days on earth tolerable how can anybody question that hmm it just it's beyond it defies belief it really does it's crazy but like we said you know this is the way to make a change with you watching this right now thank you thank you for watching the very end and if people want to

ri5-aqBDRIc,Medicinal cannabis: what is the competitive advantage of investing in Australia for global markets?,2019-09-20T00:27:51Z,"well welcome everybody my name's Connie basic I'm the moderator for this session on medicinal agriculture and as we were coming here we were commenting on how privileged the position we're in is not only it's a opportunity of a lifetime but probably one of the century because we actually are involved in an industry that could transform health and lives and so it is a very exciting time to be there and it's an exciting time because Australia also offers an environment that is considered safe trustworthy and has a regulatory environment so in terms of an industry it's growing at a faster rate than any industry is 9/2 it's sort of got a better twenty five to forty percent compound annual growth rate is talked about how much of that is hyperbolas not because what we're going to address today huge expectations from consumers and patients as to what it can deliver and we really do need to understand what is based in evidence and what is anecdotal and so I think it's really important that the foundations of the end of the industry are really laid down and there's evidence to support the claims that are being made in it so to further complicate the ecosystem it's considered an illegal drug and an illegal substance by the UN narcotics Act yet it's being legalized from additional purposes worldwide and so how does that fit within the regulatory environment so we have a fantastic panel today that really covers the globe and also the market environment and right through to the local regulatory environment both from a federal and a state level so what we're going to do today is we'll get each panel member to briefly introduce themselves we'll then I'll have a question to the panel to a panel member there'll be a slight discussion about 40 minutes of Q&A annal discussion and I want to leave 20 minutes for Q&A so that the audience can participate in that and we both have it's going to be electronic as well as with live here so with that I'll get everybody to give one minute Jen and then we'll move on okay hi I'm cam badly I'm chief corporate officer of Aurora cannabis we are a company that's gone in the time I've been with them about three and a half years from 35 employees to more than 3000 worldwide we're now operating in 25 countries and that's kind of a good example as to what's been happening in this industry and the the pace at which has been growing thanks cam I'm Peter croc I'm CEO of kin group based here in Melbourne we were the first to get through the office of drug control licensing process though the first cultivator operating in Australia I am Oren Everett I'm the managing director of Medi farm labs were Canadian headquartered company just north of Toronto and I have a manufacturing facility here in Victoria about an hour and a half south of Melbourne good morning everyone I'm Ben quieren I'm the regional managing director for canopy growth based out of here in Melbourne canopy growth is a Canadian cannabis company globally we specialize in medicinal cannabis and we have a footprint across 16 countries across the world where we operate cultivation manufacturing and R&D capabilities hi I'm John Skerritt I am deputy secretary for health and the Commonwealth and I've got overall responsibility for the office of Drug Control which regulates the manufacture cultivation of medicinal cannabis and also for TGA our Therapeutic Goods Administration which manages patient access to medicinal cannabis and we had our 15,000 prescription just this month hi I'm Megan Hickson on the director of agriculture industry development and agricultural Victoria which is a state government and I've been responsible for the last three years of delivering some the government's commitments to establish a local medicine or cannabis industry in Victoria and support the government to the relative commitments to legalize most from cannabis other things in my industry look at how we grow and develop agriculture industries whether that's the industry digital adoption of technology on farm on farm energy and things also like how do we respond to climate change so thank you say you can see a fantastic panel that can really cover all aspects of the industry so hopefully you're getting your questions ready cam 25 to 40 percent growth rate annually predicted to be bigger than the beverage market by 2035 what's the fact and what's the hyperbole in this in this game there's not a lot of hyperbole the story of medical cannabis globally right now is one of unstoppable momentum I often call it a global mega trend a rapid change in law society and business that is sweeping the globe and there's a reason for that we've seen country after country some of them very surprising countries change their attitudes with respect to medical cannabis and the pressure is coming from the patient's themselves you know you take a look at the United Kingdom for example we're at the beginning of 2018 you had a flat no from the government with respect to the idea of creating a medical cannabis system based on the stories of two very sick little boys with intractable epilepsy public sympathy for patients overturned that and the country did a 180 that's one example of how rapidly things are changing and it's a good thing it's helping patients and at the same time it's creating an unprecedented brand-new economic opportunity we don't see the opportunity to participate in the creation of a brand-new global industry very often these are exciting times and so why do you say all the interest from Canadian companies into Australia what's the attraction Canada by happy accident started first we established a truly well-regulated medical cannabis system on a national basis before anybody else and we got a head start there and then the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau went ahead and said yes we weren't kidding we are going to legalize cannabis for consumer use this brought in a lot of capital it gave Canadian companies massive lead and one of the first places that we look to to partner was Australia so we of course are partnered with can group here and and one of the reasons is certainly there's an affinity between the two countries but there are a lot of similarities you've got good public policy for which these countries are known good regulation good reputations for businesses so when you're dealing with an Australian you know what you're going to get there straight shooters and that's part of what makes Australia is such an attractive place for investment in this brand-new industry and we're just at the earliest days and Australia is establishing a measure of world leadership here it's great to see thanks Ben your invite the global but also heavily focused on the Asia Pacific and I think we've seen over the last few days people draw circles around the Asia Pacific India and China is really where the population growth is and presumably that's why the interest in the market because it's true there so what do you see as the prospects so the asia-pacific region is you know footprint wise you've got 51 percent of the global population so and land masses it's very diverse so we're dealing with a great deal of opportunity but we're also trying to work in how do you put in place a framework that actually makes sense how do you enable appropriate patient access but making sure you've got the right quality standards that apply across that so the template we talk around is very much what's occurred in Australia so when I'm actually going in and speaking to various parties across the region the template that SSE referenced is Australia we talk about what we've done from the Canadian perspective in regards to establishing a global platform that can enable us to cultivate manufacturer and produce medicine of quality standards and that part of the discussion today is really around when we go into Asia is it Thailand is it China is it India is it Malaysia is it New Zealand everyone's have everyone's at a very different stage of the process at this point in time so for us it's yes there's a I think everyone got points too there's a great deal of value here and a great deal of opportunity but it's getting people on the right journey and making sure that they we all were all addressing the needs for patients thanks Peter you were the first to get a license in Australia to cultivate and manufacture and I've really been at the vanguard of the movement here so how do you see the Australian environment and what the opportunities are here and can we be globally competitive yeah thanks Tony it's a good question it is exciting times I think the real challenge for Australia having started and we're now into the third year of the the system here and it really is gaining momentum it is now back to patient access is real focus that needs to occur whilst this is an opportunity commercially it's actually an opportunity to change lives and that should be the primary driver here is to address the patient needs and keeping the focus on that ensuring that we're attracting the right quality people into the industry is really important that we make sure it isn't just Green Rush people rushing in to make money out of this it's actually the patients that need to drive it and that's where we need the biggest change in Australia the state versus federal position that we've got is it well it's how we operate here in Australia the states have started talking about harmonization but we really need to drive that to ensure that we've got consistency across the states but as we do that and delivering a product that doctors can contrast and understand that's where the TGA GMP standard that we're working to will set Australia apart and is a global opportunity for us so their Health Minister Minister Hunt last January announced that they were going to all our exports that was to ensure that we could work from a scale that would allow this industry to establish here so that is driving access for Australia Australian patients first so that's the key thing and I think it is what the community is looking for now is accelerating that patient access fantastic so Warren Australia has a GMP startup manufacturer Australia has a great reputation for commodity production but hasn't really done very well on a manufacturing and we've seen that in the popping industry where we're probably the second biggest exporter yet we do very little value add you know a half a billion of a seventeen billion dollar market you see it as a different opportunity for the medicinal cannabis to actually have the whole pipeline developed in Australia yes I think there's two ways to answer that I think you look first offers the opportunity I think the first mover advantage piece is critical I think Canada as cam said a second ago kind of a sort of fell on their feed into the medicinal cannabis space and the first mover advantages has put them in good stead for it to operate as a global company out of Canada we had the same same sort of first mover advantage here with the added benefit of operating under the TGA so with the TGA I'd say that the two words I look for here is gold standard to which we operate under you know Canada deployed their framework under GPP we operate under a GMP framework which basically gives us mutual recognition globally for us to export product which is you know as much as we're all here for patients as Peter mentioned yeah there is that natural bell curve that we need to go through for patient access here but for us to function as a company we need revenue and revenue comes from international exports and we can obtain that under our gold standard of product creation however in the future there is that risk so on the opposite side of this what what limitations may we have in the future in terms of being able to manufacture a product that is I guess financially able to support the industry here and that's where I think probably I'd say speaking on behalf of Medi farm labs here we're unique in the industry ourselves you need to have a finger on the pulse in terms of the commodity price so if you look at the manufacturing of product today the highest costs in the manufacturing part part of the product of the process is actually the cultivation that's that's where a lot of the energy and the costs go into so identifying low-cost cultivation at a higher quality is actually extremely important and if you don't have vision on how to do that you know cam and I just got back from Thailand you know we are looking at Southeast Asia and short cam and Aurora also looking into regions in South America you need to be able to identify how you can get commodity price down however still we want to consider the fact that we can bring product into Australia manufacture it under an Australian stamp and get the accreditation under GMP would allow us to export that product internationally and still maintain a viable manufacturing business in this industry so John you're the ODC has been mentioned by every speaker and I and clearly it's seen as the gatekeeper and an important one to maintain the safety understands the regulatory environment perhaps you'd like to comment on that environment and where you see it evolving to in terms of growing an industry well regulators should be facilitators as well as gatekeepers and government in setting the regulations almost three years ago made a clear decision but Australia was going to have a cannabis industry based on cannabis as a medicinal product and therefore requiring certain quality standards whether in manufacture or in finished product standards there was a recognition also that we didn't want to go the route of the opiate industry and maps of commodities and in keeping with the theme of this whole conference the government's made a clear decision that the focus for exports wouldn't be on bulk cannabis as a commodity yes cannabis products as intermediates can be exported but they were very keen to enable finish those forms to be exported whether that's bad for vaporization or whether it's oils or whatever and that's for direction me industry is heading there is a challenge always on price of cultivation and especially as electricity and water prices go up indoor protected cultivation can be predicted protected cropping can be an expensive option and as someone who was around when the debate with government was happening about should be sown we'd be restricted to putting in the greenhouse situation or an indoor situation the decision was no outdoor cultivation in Australia is permitted now and there are a couple of businesses that are in that business of outdoor cultivation the downside of course is that perhaps with the exception of tropical queensland you're only going to get one or maybe two if you're sowing times the right and your genetics is right you're only going to get a maximum of two crops per seeds and as opposed to say four and that's the business model that some companies for example in Tasmania have decided to adopt so do you see the hope we've just heard that the big price factor Porsche is going to be around the cultivation side of things and some countries are going to open sort of farming situations but here it's more in the regulatory sort of it's much more confined to a class house no no no no there's not there's no requirement in law and as I said there's a couple of companies but have built their business model I mean this is no state secret because there's one company that decided to use an immigration dissent detention center that was no longer needed no it's not on Christmas Island within within continental or within Australian territory I should say and so that's one model where they're cultivating outdoors we have several companies but I have an outdoor cultivation model as I've said the trouble is of course a big cultivation is in seasonally constrained and so some of those companies balso consider having a winter indoor cultivation model too so they're really business decisions for the company there's always a challenge as a former Aggie one of the challenges of course with the outdoor cultivation for a crop like cannabis is you'll get the risk of variability in product and and so these are all the trade-offs but where Australia's positioning itself is I guess it's fair to say I'm a premium into the market now you can't be ignorant of production costs and you can't be blind to to what the Germans of a Dutch or or other European countries will pay in that market but but we are aiming for a premium medicinal quality product so hey is that it synchronizes well with the need for defined products in terms of TGA approval for them for the matter as a medicine way so we are hoping and expecting that there will be some products that all go through and be fully approved TGA medicines and therefore available at U corner pharmacy but we also recognize that there'll be another pathway for these products as unapproved medicines for our own patients and as I've said we hit 15 15 thousand prescriptions last month but the export component of industry will be an incredibly important driver in getting the industry volumes and also maintaining that quality reputation thank you so Megan is the the state that really has been at the vanguard of driving there's no catalyst industry here and been closely involved with policy on the agriculture side and on the other how does Victoria view the current situation where do you see it heading and bearing in mind always our cousins from across the ocean of New Zealand who are thinking in a very different way we heard discussion about the federal and state issues how do you see that playing through well I'm really positive about it and I think it's got an exciting future I think when the Victorian government got involved and made the commitments in 2014 kind of like can it be what there was nothing else in Australia wasn't legal there was there was no even budding of an industry and we've seen huge development in that time I think with we got involved we our focus has been really on how do we develop a local industry that it supplies patients in Australia as well as an export market I think both of those parts remain priorities they're really important we've focused a lot on research I think we've developed over 200 proprietary strains profiles and it's been a key part for us about supporting industry develop here as well as our understanding expertise our navigating the system so I see we've had a lot of investment in Victoria's is really positive we obviously know that there's a long lead time for companies here to get products to market and that's important so we know our framework a read-through framework that we're banking on is really about a safe reputation I'm looking forward to seeing those products become available to patients here see how that makes it more affordable and then what happens in export markets and I think I'm really interested in particularly my panel members what what are the key export markets we know there's a lot a lot of speculation and seeing that come to fruition is really important so it's pretty exciting times does anybody want to jump in though I think the export market is exactly right but I think the work that that's been done at the Trobe University specifically is so I guess reflective of how Australia has perceived this industry you look at Canada quite quickly moved from a medicinal framework into a recreational framework which you know kind of diluted the the the fact that we still in Australia see cannabis as a medicine but the work specifically done within Latrobe University cannabis is not 0-1 you either got it or you don't and it's not just CBD or THC which is the next layer of detail the plant has hundreds of cannabinoids in it and each cannabinoid today could be a symptom treatment for many different conditions that people face and we're at the cusp of what I would say a revolution and the work starts from my perspective at the agricultural level being able to assess the genetic identified different ways to manipulate up and down percentage of cannabinoids and then getting it out to an extract and having a library of different cannabinoids in their different formats and then being able to put that out into a medicinal market globally Leanne's us in good stead for the next 3-5 you know I don't have a crystal ball I wish I did but quite a lot of years ahead of us because of the work that's done from I guess a federal and state level and I think that's tremendous the way we've deployed it that way anybody else want to jump in on that one Ben came I think the thing we were saying at the moment and you know Megan to your point the export opportunity is significant okay I think particularly with the standards that are being set out of Astro now people are looking at that and saying what is the roadmap to actually having a locally produced product that can be exported the discussions I have across Asia today are very much around yes there's a name patient approach that can be achieved in various parts of the world but when do we get to the opportunity actually having that product that will be available and you know like my peers across here we we're working very actively to make that a reality you know the thing for me is and very focused on is keep away from the PowerPoint and make it real right we need to get to the position where we have local cultivation we have local manufacturing and we have the ability to produce a medicine of quality and that and that in itself will actually enable us to actually set up a global export play to further the discussion about taking this regionally taking us across Asia the thing that both Canadians and Australians have going for us is our credibility it needs to be protected those who are following the cannabis sector will have seen that we've had some difficulties in Canada with some companies that broke the freaking rules and that has hurt all of us and that should be a cold shower wake up for everybody not just in Canada in this business but in Australia as well we have to make sure that we remind ourselves that there are catastrophic risks associated with breaking the rules because the whole world is watching I was meeting with the Thai Food and Drug Administration last week in Bangkok and they were fully aware of the the problems that we have had in Canada and that's not a reflection on the Health Canada regulators that as a group of public servants I've never seen more professional than that these are public servants with the same sense of mission that we have in the private sector that will pick up a phone on their mobile in the evening around the weekend the onus is on us as business people to make sure that we preserve the credibility of this now that said I think the credibility remains exceedingly high and once again that goes back to the level of rigorous regulation and the reputation of our regulators and and they lead for us that story is there in markets around Asia and Latin America in other parts of the world before we ever enter the room and so if we're careful to keep that regulation professional or that reputation professional and and also also as Canadians not to push the consumer legalization story I want to end on that point we do not presume to tell other countries how to manage their regulations around cannabis we can speak about the Canadian experience as you can speak about the Australian experience but what my own belief is is that these discussions with respect to whether a country wants to proceed to then that next step at any point of consumer the legalization that will happen organically and it's a discussion to be had within that country and I'll put my hat on as chairman of the MCI a medicinal cannabis industry Australia where the first license holders have come together to form an industry body both to provide feedback to the regulator and and in fact the legislative review process it's just undergone recently we we were part of that but from the MCA perspective again the industry believes that this is a medical play only and that's that's got to be the focus so that's absolutely reinforce what cam just said it's it's all very nice to share the love of a regulatory system although I think it's important to emphasize that it is evolving and when it was set up we were moving into uncharted territory in Australia we didn't want to go over-- direction there wasn't any other country that our political masters thought was an appropriate model they so we developed an Australian model and the agreement therefore always was to review it after two years now at the time there was a lot of concern especially from law enforcement and while we sit here and talk about cannabis as a agricultural product as a medicine as an export opportunity we shouldn't forget that organized crime still use coal evasion of cannabis as a way of laundering large amounts of money it's funny notwithstanding the high degree of community consumer acceptability I should also add they use things like illegal cigarettes for which excise hasn't been paid on to order money to and but they don't use wheat or cotton I've noticed that two cups of a chase so the original system that was put in place had a range of regulatory controls and requirements and information requirements for cultivators for people who wanted to get into the industry we wanted to know about their business associates we wanted to know a fair fit and proper people and you can see by the upstanding nature of the other people on this panel they're very fit and proper but we still have to prove it yeah but a review was done now we're a few hours too early because the actual review I'm advised and misses up to someone sitting up in Parliament House who a clerk of a Senate to be precise we're advised for review will be released at four o'clock this afternoon strange things happen it could be tomorrow but we're hoping it'll be today and I encourage you to go it'll-it'll be on the Palmer House website and and so just google now Drugs Act review and so that review really looked at whether some of the administrative requirements were not adding value you know where we asked after the same information twice did we really need to know that your great-aunt had had had a speeding ticket in nineteen hundred and thirty two so the sort of level of detail is it adding any value or security to the system is it actually impeding industry development is a structure of requiring separate cultivation manufacture and commercial production licenses a challenge if you want to bring you new genetics at notice and so forth so I'd love to be able to tell you what government's going to announce but I want to have a job tomorrow and so all I'll do is is I am able to give you a hint but I think that they'll be widespread support for the recommendations and to use words from a prime minister there will be a strong emphasis of congestion busting so watch this space and hopefully late afternoon evening the report will be out and available sounds great we're looking for two so there is a tension in the ecosystem at the moment though we have the consumers once a wire head pushing wanting the material released we have like in Australia the AMA saying basically there's very few properly regulated probably one or two literally you could count anything a properly regulated trials it's a show efficacy and so where do you see research playing a role in this environment because I'd like to bring this up because that's a really important part of the ecosystem and I'm happy for any member of the panel to comment on that amit what's the advantage in australia or having within our sort of research environment that you see and the opportunity for us yeah look I think I'll start at least but I think who probably also be saying the same thing there's no doubt that the science needs to catch up with and because of prohibition there has been no work done with cannabis throughout the world so from a scientific perspective what an exciting prospect to have the doors open where we can work with it so from a regulatory perspective we've got to try and make this workable so that we can accelerate that that process but yes so there's there's a lot of work to do another important thing though is to say that we talk about patient access and clearly the doctor is a huge part of that that process this isn't about educating doctors doctors don't need educating that they do need supporting data so that they can make the right decisions I think that one of the hard things so from my perspective is is as I said before each each particular like the amount of variations of a cannabis plant is infinite and when consider that an each particular use case that you might have as a symptom it's going to take quite a long time for us to get to the actual finite the outcome of what specific percentages of each particular cannabinoid and terpene profile will we'll treat a symptom and say that I'm probably a bit more socially progressive in my thinking around how we go about this obviously research is important but also there's no data supporting that cannabis has ever killed anybody no one's overdose from cannabis before so I think that having as a doctor I'm sympathetic because if the amount of variations of cannabis is infinite being able to prescribe it is it absolutely impossible because you're you're ultimately trying to identify which a particular strain will will treat them and if you're just thinking about high tier C or high CBD as your definition of a symptom treatment then ultimately the patient will have very different effects from taking that drug each time they take it which is concerning and as a doctor I don't know sir think that way went to university to learn all the different variables of cannabis so we've got a long way to go but no you want to add to that so we are as an industry alongside colleagues in academia we are conducting clinical trials with respect to the clinical utility of cannabis around the world that's happening it has to happen that said it shouldn't hold us up and as much as the AMA has been hesitant about medical cannabis so has the Canadian Medical Association and remains that way but the most important for Canadian patients has been that the membership of the Medical Association in Canada has not waited we now have more than 20,000 physicians who have written a prescription for medical cannabis and as a result we now have more than 400,000 Canadians with the prescription from the doctor to manage the symptoms of their health condition with medical cannabis I see things with respect to medical cannabis a little bit differently from other areas of medicine after spending my career in the biopharmaceutical industry and the way I would sum it up is this when we're talking about a disease modifying therapy something like a hypertension medicine or a cancer drug we have to go through the clinical trial process and whether it's a cannabis based medicine or not it must go through the same level of discipline however I would submit that there is a different level of evidence required when it comes to symptom management and this is where cannabis shines this is what it is used for it's used for pain it's used for the spasticity and multiple sclerosis and bowel disease and anxiety disorders and on and on and on and if a patient tells you that their pain is less or their anxiety is less or their seizures are fewer we have to take them at their word so that's part of the answer back to the medical community it is respectful it is in agreement with respect to some of the claims that we all have a responsibility to deal with where there are those who say that cannabis cures cancer I do not want to see a situation where a patient does not accept proper proven treatment for a serious disease like cancer and assumes that cannabis is a disease modifying therapies where it has not been proven to it to be so on symptoms I think we have to have a different conversation with the medical community I would support the fact that it's important to be quite clear there's a difference between alleviation amelioration of symptoms same cancer of and treatment of a disease where are perhaps differ is that I think it is still possible and it would certainly aid with adoption and rational use to be able to collect that data on alleviation of symptoms I mean there's a hot debate out there in the medical community as to whether medicinal cannabis can replace a lot of opioids we all know that we have an over your crisis out there we need good evidence base objective data collection just just on that and yes if individuals by their own voting with their feet attorney the cannabis instead of opioids that needs to be documented but I think that we shouldn't shy away from attempting to collect good data on that because that will really help with rational prescribing so we've got thanks John so perhaps I think it's time to open up we've gone from cultivation manufacture efficacy regulation consumer we've covered at all we've raised what the panel sees as the issues I'd love to throw it out to the audience now for a Q&A this or you've got some already online right yes we do have quite a lot of questions flowing through so I'm just going to direct the first one to Warren is Mary farm seeking to import cannabis for inputs in your Australian products if so why in which country are we looking at and how do we address the traceability issues around that that's very yes great question yes so I guess in simple form the answer is is is yes where we are able to under the regulatory framework so you know we we have to adhere to very strict rules under the regulatory framework to which countries we can import product from as we talk about international exportation we need to adhere to things like GAC P G AP which are agricultural practices with specific standards behind them and the country has to have mutual recognition for us to import but product can be important internationally today within the same realms of ensuring the product where it comes from is not dissimilar to me Bryan product from my cultivation partners all across Australia so insurance that the certificate of analysis meets specific requirements that there's no use of pesticides that they're it meets all the different regulatory standards around that so we're we're importing product from ultimately comes down to ensuring the countries meet those standards first and foremost but second of all it's going to come down to the commodity pricing in in the end and ensuring we can have a low-cost product because as much as we want patient to stay have product access when it's $600 a month its unobtainable for almost everyone in the room okay thanks for that word I've got a question at the front can I just ask also make it really nice and short and sharp just question though comments and please direct your question thanks a great panel thank you very much I'm Tony Agastya from biotech bridge I was trying to invite Raphael Michelin from Israel to join the panel unfortunately he couldn't make it and in conversation with him he really really stressed and touches some of the point here when the industry will show some a solid emphasis and energy as like building GMP manufacturing facilities growing cannabis with the same intensity and passion bring more evidence with clinical trials try to bring more clarity we know that there are more than 140 phyto cannabinoids and Counting I totally believe in the benefit that we can bring to the patients but when the industry is going to embrace the opportunity from all the aspect but with scientific evidence and clinical trial thank you I'm sorry there's another one back there good questions two things GMP it's happening in fact at at Aurora we've got two European Union GMP facilities and two more that are about to achieve that certification plus our distributor in Europe I have a sense that that could become a global standard it's the highest standard in the world in the same standard to which European pharmaceutical companies are held and the more we can collectively reach those standards and achieve those same standards the more of the credibility and that will help us around the world second thing is the clinical research it's underway companies like canopy and Aurora are funding currently scores of clinical trials they're not the same scale of clinical trials that you see in the pharmaceutical industry with tens of thousands or more patients in a phase three trial but they are significant they're useful and they'll give us specific insights into the use of cannabis on specific ailments it's already happening it's already underway and it's getting bigger and just on that one quickly with the Olivia newton-john Cancer Research Institute here in Melbourne were working and in fact daddy Mary from Israel is involved in that trial as well so and that one's actually focused on on a wellness measure for the patient to try and quantify and show that you're having an impact on symptoms sorry I'm from the state government to speak to so we've obviously got GMP level facilities and melon and which has been made a big impact in terms of been able to support industry establish here access those facilities at that high standard well they also build their own GMP level facilities which is really exciting good morning Stuart Gordon from CSR again food ex Latrobe eggy a couple of looking for comments from John and Tony and Peter perhaps the first comment for John how do you see regulation of THC from its more temperate CBD cousin in the future with the in the context of broadacre growers harvesting the CBD and Peter and Tony you talked a little bit about the cost of production as a plant breeder we know that cost of production can be reduced by yields and quality factors and I wondered about the you know breeding breeding programs within Australia at the moment well I'll start off with the question about cultivation and regulation around broadacre crops of CBD rich versus THC rich cannabis we are constrained by the United Nations International Convention we've got to align with that because that's absolutely fundamental to us being able to import and export with certain countries at the moment the requirements around a crop but even if it's high in CBD only and therefore you know not likely to be diverted down to the local pub the requirements are still that it be treated separately and it is treated as cannabis that means that we're required to have certain security around the supply chain and certain security around the cultivation but in practical terms if a company only is cultivating the CBD type medicinal cannabis the security requirements are not are not as prescriptive and not as high as if they were called in cultivating ithc strains but something we work with the companies on a case-by-case basis but just for shadowing the next session at the moment internationally and in Australia industrial hemp farmers cannot offtake their crop for use in CBD product manufacture that's a point of some tension but it derives from the black and white law under the International Convention for narcotic drugs but interesting leejohn in different states here we have different levels of THC that they can grow that high CBD in which I think but but it's still better they're still industrial hemp beverages I was gonna make that point but I'll get on to the research and the accelerated breeding programs and in terms of what the Victorian Government and Latrobe have done with the Agri bio Center at 75% Victorian government but the accelerated breeding the genomics work that's going to be driven out here we had Jonathan page from Canada came out he was the first sequence of cannabis chain ohm and he said I'm green with envy said the Canadian AG Department still don't recognize cannabis as a crop and we've got a 288 million dollar facility that is absolutely state-of-the-art and the best parallel is with what they've done with the dairy industry here every dairy animal in Australia is on their genetic database and they can take a DNA sample from a six week old bull calf and tell you what its progeny are going to produce within 1% if we use that and we are using that same computing power and capability with cannabis we're going to make huge advances and and I think with both the agricultural and medical research capability in Melbourne and Australia we're going to drive changes in this area it's going to be fantastic yeah I just going to say I think we can bring a lot the technologies of in broadacre that Australia has been very important in in developing into this industry because there is a lot of yield benefits that can come from that I mean another area is going to be disease resistance as well it's important I suppose from my perspective one of the things I would like to do to see the industry advance is that like the grains industry has done in Australia where they've got a seed bank that's nationally funded and is you know open to all research community to access I would like to see the government's actually moved towards doing that with medicinal cannabis seed and provide a seed bank that the research community can very quickly work with and breed and provide unique germ plasm that's optimized for our conditions because they're going to be different to others and especially you know you've got now we've heard the open farming well open to a point farming solution we've got the glasshouse thing although and so each of those will probably need different breeding strategies to optimize and also different technologies so I think it's an exciting time the Commonwealth now funded the medicinal research AG hub that we have with Commonwealth funding to see us grow the sector and I think together with what the state government's been doing here in Victoria there's a unique opportunity to really grow both industries actually the hemp industry as well as as the medicinal cannabis industry we've got a question that's very later to this as well who is the lowest cost producer currently in the world for medicinal cannabis and where do you expect the global supply of cannabis will be in the long term so who are our biggest competitors in the long term that's - I think that globally now things that things are evolving quite significantly and we're starting to see footprint expand into geographies like Latin America South out in southern Africa and now you're starting to see regions like you know Thailand discussion points and so on I think at the end of the day is really going to come down to you know we talked about cultivation the cost of cultivation labor is a major cost factor it is very melee bur intensive still today on how we were operating that side of it so I think we need to take those considerations to play but at the same time how do you actually take that product and actually enable you to export that or produce that for the local and domestic market so to answer your question I mean we can talk about places like Mizzou - we can talk about places like Columbia - and where low costs to be able to grow these things and you do broadacre grow so I think that's from our perspective that's where you can drive the cost down but it needs to be tested and proven longer-term only add to that and and I agree with what you have said and where you're going we add a roar we look at it this way there are a couple of ways of producing any good on an economic basis in manufacturing for example some companies choose to produce in developing countries where there are low labor costs others choose to produce in developed countries using a very high degree of automation in the end both approaches are competitive we are doing both that are we are doing outdoor grow we're operating in equatorial regions we're also doing the most high-tech cannabis production in the world with the highest level of automation and robotics what we are finding is that the true cost of production is converging as you apply this technology and you get consistency out of your crops and very high yields and high levels of active pharmaceutical ingredients the cost comes way down and at the same time I have heard I have heard claims at different conferences around the world that in this country Equatorial country you can produce for $0.10 a gram no 5 no - 10 cents a gram we'll give you money back it gets a little crazy when you actually add the cost of quality assurance and other real costs and the cost of actually entering highly regulated markets such as achieving EU GMP standards the actual cost is converging with with high-tech production so we're looking at both there are no answers but I don't think you're gonna find that one will be on a revolutionary basis significantly cheaper than the other great thanks for that Cameron got a question over here from the poll Lachlan grout from hem Farms Australia my question is if there's a such a focus on cost of production per hectare and obviously there are quite a few passionate people on this panel about a high quality product at a low cost will it turn into a an industry that's driven by low imports and high production output or will it be I guess in the industry driven by this I guess money capital passion in getting genetics that work broadacre as well as indoor winter tolerant as well as summer tolerant and being able to produce a high value crop out of that or will it just be a turnover of bringing in low-cost produce using already established processing methods here to produce a medium to high quality end product that may not be as good control because you're not producing it here it could be all of the above Lachlan you're correct in Agriculture's scale is everything there's no doubt about that and in Australia we know that as well as anyone you know we produce some of the most efficient product from a pretty harsh environment as cam said though you can lay a technology over the top of it and that is the angle that we're taking in terms of of what we're doing down here what's really exciting though is that this is all untapped and and the opportunities in the research and the accelerated breeding and other aspects to what can come right through the manufacturing you know we're also partnering with CSIRO and got some leading technology we're looking at that will feed back into the manufacturing facilities like Warren so all of all of the above is is possible and there's space for a lot of players in all of that there isn't going to be one single player that's going to come in and dominate this it's it's going to be spread across a raft of different approaches and and really exciting approaches it's a race to the start we're a long way from the bottom and I think ultimately you know with genetic that the ladder that statement is so true you know and I said cannabis is not cannabis is not cannabis it's not zero one unique genetics complex genetics will win over time and you'll have something unique but even if we just talk all these water bottles here is one use case for our downstream product and said beverages there is a multi-billion dollar market right there topicals food edibles just continue on and look out there any type of product and say that it's infused with cannabis and that's where the future will be the crystal ball again I wish I had one but we've got a long way to go then did anybody else want to say I'll close up at this point well thank you all very much for coming it just leaves me to I thank the panel but I'd like to make the comment that those of you who were fortunate enough to hear Howard Schapiro yesterday talking about the addressing the problems of malnutrition in Africa he talked about the uncommon collaboration and I think it's so pleasing to and that's really setting up alliances between governments multinationals who are food producers governments and things like that to work collaboratively to solve those problems and I think you can sort of see from the composition of the panel here where we have some of the largest competitors in the market we have the regulators we have the manufacturers that if we can start having this conversation and dialogue early in the development of this market then I think we can generate the solutions that and at the end of the day that our benefits to the consumer so thank you very much Anna Lord and it's been a fantastic session thanks round of applause for Tony on the panel thank you very much now just a quick announcement at 3:00 p.m. if you're still very interested in what's happening in the cannabis space and really looking to dive deep and have a conversation we've actually got a 3:00 p.m. session with Peter croc at the can group and my co-founder there kal raise your hand at the back if you find him at the Victorian Government stand just around the corner we'll be having a fireside chat that's at 3 o'clock today so thanks again for the panel and we'll see you in 15 minutes around him thank"
GESzkv0fCqI,Medical Cannabis - The Australian Story,2019-08-13T15:06:31Z,hi good morning everybody welcome to the conscious living show I'm Patricia Hamilton and conscious living is all about bringing new information bringing insights and understanding into all the fields that in our emerging of expanding consciousness in health and environment and spirituality and this morning I've got the pleasure of talking with Paul Ava and Paul is the director of health house international and he's involved with a very exciting field of research and development and that is medical cannabis so welcome Paul good morning and look I'm fascinated because you told me that you were a complete skeptic when it came to cannabis and being a pharmacist I can imagine that you were pretty much trained in the traditional scientific and evidence-based field of medicine and you were very skeptical that natural therapies as well so what what turned you around well we always saw cannabis as a dangerous highly addictive drug and we never saw it as a medical option but a few years back I saw some horrific data relating to pharmaceutical opioids and the massive death toll they have they're highly addictive and they cause a lot of harms very easy to overdose on and in a lot of patients they cause constipation so if this became interested in cannabis because I saw some statistics that show cannabis responses or deaths and very difficult overdose on so as a treatment for chronic pain or end-of-life pain certainly make an option for some patients and what is really fascinating is you were just telling me earlier that in fact pharmacists were prescribing cannabis in various forms to treat pain and other illnesses that's great well yeah circa 1930s doctors were prescribing we're dispensing medicinal cannabis with some of the same things some of the same conditions worse time to rediscover now like chronic pain renders life pain or drug-resistant epilepsy come full circle I think that's personally and also what you were telling me is that Australia is now really at the forefront of researching into medicinal cannabis there's some really exciting projects happening and at last count I think there's 35 different research projects involving medicinal cannabis in Australia and from all levels from preclinical through to and so this has happened very recently hasn't it because you were the first company to import that was may 2017 and since then there's been a lot of different products come into Australia and we're now producing GMP grade we did some cannabis huge Australian product that's to market and more and more patients have been able to access some of the research behind and he's quite exciting potentially another a number of different conditions and get prescribers some evidence to actually roll it out to more patients who could benefit so let's talk about the conditions that people who might be listening may have and may want to know if they would be eligible to access so there's four main conditions where there's good clinical evidence and of those four 80% of the patients roughly we've seen access to Australia in accessing for chronic pain and whilst there's other drops chronic pain medical cannabis has found some of those patients not only be pain-free but sleep better it's got a mild anti-anxiety you know and it's giving some of them an appetite so it's really so what's what kinds of chronic pain conditions would be would be suitable particularly neuropathic pain where this this nerve pain we've seen patients with back pain what they call diabetic neuropathy different different pain conditions anything where there's long term arthritic pain yeah because I mean we're all aging as we talked before we're living longer and our bodies are you know developing eggs and pains so I mean how serious of level of pain do you do you need to have before you can actually apply to to use this so to access medicinal cannabis in Australia you need to exhausted a number of other options it's not a first-line treatment there are a lot of other drugs for pain so you should perhaps to try them things like paracetamol or some anti-inflammatories or alternative things like massage or exercise cannabis sits on the scale that eats it's not as I say first-line treatment but we're people living in pain and we get rid of the pain entirely it may reduce the pain school to make it easier to go about your day to day life so so how do people go about selling that process do they need to go and see their medical doctor certainly okay so to access it legally in Australia you need to first see GP because they know your medical history you may then need a referral to a specialist particularly pain specialists or there were a few clinics who can handle pain patients in Australia and make it easy for them to access and so you were telling me earlier that this there's a big uptake now in the last two years how many people roughly would be receiving that's right we're seeing quite a significant month on month growth approvals for medical cannabis and in the first year to give you some idea that was only three hundred patient approvals end of year two there's two thousand and we're heading towards years re where we're looking at up to twenty thousand patient approvals so we've seen some significant growth in Canada they're up to three hundred to four hundred thousand medical patients that's fantastic and the other really interesting and exciting area that we were discussing this research and hearing because I know that you know cancer and cancer treatments using traditional forms of chemotherapy are really and invasive and you were saying that there is a potential for medicinal cannabis to alleviate that or perhaps work in harmony that's right with those treatments for that sounds really good okay so we were at at the moment one of the four major conditions for cannabis where there's good clinical evidence use cannabis of an or C in cats related Kemmer and that's what that's across the line it's giving some patients an appetite where they are nauseous and was her up our other drugs for nausea I'm told nothing helps certain metallic like tongue feeling that patients get chemotherapy quite like cannabis and it gives him an appetite and quality of life but here in Perth we're having quite a bit of research done on pancreatic cancer professor Marco Falasca of Kern University's done some interesting work very clinical work involving rap models where he's combined chemotherapy and cannabis and found that's extended the lives of his rad subjects quite considerably so he's looking at following that up with human trial it's very exciting and you were saying that the whole area the whole field of Indo cannabinoid research and understanding is also fairly new to a lot of doctors and people in the medical that's right so the endocannabinoid system the actual receptors of the cancer chemicals work on was only discovered mid 19th and most medical professionals myself included were not formally trained on that at university and so i didn't just been start to be taught in medical schools now and it's responsible for things like the immune function appetite and pain and more and more has been discovered about this and studied about it hopefully in the future so isn't it interesting that a drug that was formerly prohibited and illegal it's now being responsible for actually opening up a whole new field that's right a scientific research that's right it's virtually a pharmaceutical treasure-trove there's 144 different cannabinoids in the plant as well as a bunch of terpenes ingredients that we're still researching exactly what does what and we've got quite a few years ahead of it before we can unlock things in stem we need to so the humble plant is really at this time on our planet and in our population and and you're going to be sharing more about this how people can get access what kinds of conditions and how effective the treatments are at conscious living Expo coming up in October that's right and so if you want to just give us a little bit of an entree into who would be interested to come along and learn more what sort of conditions or people certainly what would benefit from coming to the talk well anyone who's interested in canvas is a treatment option we've had a lot of patients medical professionals some people have been looking at cannabis medicine typically we like to separate fact from fiction there's a lot of misinformation in that space and exactly what cannabis is capable of what some of the research is happening there some real exciting areas of research in Australia as I mentioned and where we're heading from a business level because I think it's really important to tie in an economic argument with the medical side yeah exactly and and your drinks are really interesting stuff in that space as well so one of the questions I had just the last question I know that there's a movement to legalize marijuana and a lot of people probably would be thinking well what if I'm smoking marijuana is that going to have the same effect as the medicinal cannabis in treating pain or nausea yeah great question I don't think smokey is a very good delivery method with cannabis you're getting the wrong levels you're getting more of the cycle so it's active components it's not as pure it's the same cannabis but you when you're taking Olli you're getting micro doses when you smoke you're getting massive amounts over whew and if you can imagine when you take say an antibiotic or blood pressure pepper you're getting low levels orally over a 24-hour period and most of the conditions that we found cannabis to be a benefit for our chronic illnesses over a period of time so they've made good levels of a drug over period of time rather massive mouth short term and orally is a better delivery method in a lot of cases most medicines and the same patients are getting good medical levels or getting high yeah yeah and the other question I had was there's a lot of interest in CBD oil legal in Australia to distribute and sell that product which is also nice is legal description so you can access it and it's actually a lower schedule for a pure CBD then if the product THC so you can it is easy to access and fantastic so people are going to find out a lot more I'm sure there'll be a lot more questions at the top pool so how can people get in touch with you I know that you've got an association with them medical cannabis research Australia so what would be the website and I run a company called health house help mouse dot-com do they you and Rex with that or you'll find me on

zgACisNK-Nk,Health Minister opens MEDIFARM – Australia’s first operational medical cannabis farm,2019-08-27T08:16:31Z,we are at the crossroads of good agriculture meets good healthcare which meets great policy we now must reintroduce medical cannabis to mainstream medicine just like it used to be prior to 1937 I would like to dedicate today to a wonderful boy Sam Martin who passed away in 2014 and his family and their story is the inspiration for what we're doing here today so um we now have a duty of care to help the ozzie patient and that's what we're here to do thank you we know that the Sunshine Coast is probably the most entrepreneurial region in Australia and here we have a site that gets open today that does bring together the best of Australia we know we are world leaders when it comes to health care world leaders when it comes to to medicines and here we are also as world leaders when it comes to agriculture and when you have agriculture and health come together with strong robust government policy we have new businesses emerge using the best intellectual property that the world has to offer it's a privilege to be here today because of two things one is you are creating something new which is about opportunity and health outcomes for patients and you're helping secondly to contribute to the Australian economy and growth medicinal cannabis is something which this government has legalized subject to the most rigorous conditions and arguably some of the most rigorous conditions in the world which is why Europe looks to Australia as a preferred supplier we not only legalized it but we then made sure that there was a contingency reserve was one of the first decisions I made on coming into this office available for patients as production was being developed beyond that we then opened up the export market and we did that so as to ensure that there was both priority for Australian patients that's a prerequisite of the ex market but also the capacity for Australian firms to provide healthcare to the world and this is about helping patients who might have epilepsy who might be suffering from cancer post-traumatic stress or in the palliative phases of life and so it's about ensuring that there is the best care available it is a highly regulated sector and we make no apologies for that but most importantly it's about ensuring that if the doctors determine that the medicine should be available it can be available although this is a bit of a James Bond industry if you strip away the words medical cannabis and you say schedule eight prescription medicine most of us know you go to your doctor if you are the right patient you get the right product its dispensed through a secured pharmacy if your doctor needs more information of course please visit Medi farm and we're happy to assist you ask when will our product be available we have already completed two harvests so to grow cycles of the four that five can go go on in a year very important if we are here to help the Aussie patient that we have a continuity of supply every plant that we saw today will produce enough medicine for two ozzy patients for a year's supply as mentioned before we've done two harvests we have a significant volume in the vault what you see today is a turnkey solution we are fully licensed to go from plant to patient with those medicines from this facility and we plan to do that before the end of this year due to the TGA the Therapeutic Goods Administration which is Australians quality control of medicine we do not advertise our products so price and efficacy is left up to the doctor as it should be we all at some point in time have been to a doctor and it's their clinic clinical judgment that counts I guess what we always remember is the power is with the patient in this industry because it's their health that counts most it takes a lot of courage to invest to create and to bring it all together but it looks as if what we're going to see is better outcomes for Australian patients in the most regulated and safe environment that we could possibly establish and that's a tremendous outcome for the Sunshine Coast the Queensland for Australia but above all else for patients so I am delighted to officially declare open Medi farms Queensland operations [Applause]

nPHdlXgbXY4,Is Medical Cannabis Legal in Australia,2019-05-02T22:46:03Z,okay everyone you see that little place there with the pin in it it's Australia you've got to hurry the F up we need to move on this and we need to get this viral and it only happens by you sharing it and then your friends sharing it now you usually see me more composed than this but in the last two weeks I've been contacted by four different people who have been unable to access medicinal cannabis in Australia and this really really pisses me off now there's one thing that this topic really needs and it's facts so let's have a look at that to start off let's have a look at what happened in 2016 when the narcotics Act of 1976 was overturn allowing medicinal cannabis to be legal in Australia and now three years later we have a system in place that allows people access through two different categories category a among other conditions there's epilepsy pain and cancer benefit category B individuals need to make a case for why they should be allowed access to this plant so everyone loves numbers so let's have a look at the end of March this year which was only about six weeks ago through category a there were 5200 people utilizing cannabis medicinal cannabis for category B there was about 1040 so in total there was roughly 6000 people utilizing the decent of cannabis legally in Australia this is out of an estimated a hundred thousand people you do the math so let me tell you what my problem is my problem is that I know with my hand on my heart I swear and declare that medical cannabis works I've seen it in my own life and I've seen it for the numerous cases and numerous examples that I've seen when people are suffering and battling through chemotherapy and they are able to integrate cannabis into their lives my second point is in regard and I think this will summarize it very well so the director of the Australian Centre for cannabinoid clinical and research excellence professor Jennifer Martin said this recently she's talking about cancer and what she said is that now we have really good drugs so there's no real need for cannabis products in this space mrs. Martin why the hell should you tell me or anyone else who's already suffering the trauma and going through challenges that we're not entitled to take this plan when there's good enough evidence to show that this is essential for rebalancing our body improving our youth system making us feel better don't take this away from us as I said before I think there needs to be a little less emotion at times and some more facts because people want evidence so let's have a look at this in terms of epilepsy we now have class 1 evidence that medical cannabis improves seizure control in specific epilepsy syndromes for pain is mild to moderate relief that is young par with coding and for cancer we now know that there are reductions to nausea and vomiting there is the evidence I'm going to put links to these papers so you can see it because we need to move away from a position that there's not enough evidence there's evidence to finish I need to say what I'm asking for and what it is is your help I'll oh I can't do anything on this matter I'm able to inspire you a little bit your evident watch this and feel good about it but that's not enough I've been quiet on this issue now for three years and I've had enough we need to move forward and we need to move now so what you've got to do is press comment you can write a comment below dab it like go chat or it can be like your shirt sucks I don't agree whatever it is comment on it so we can have a discussion the better option is to then press share pressing share is not for me it's for these four people that I've spoken about in the many thousands of people around Australia who need your support we need to move on this and we need to get this viral and it only happens by you sharing it and then your friends sharing it and then getting it into the hands of people that matter people that are able to make decisions to move this forward it is gone on long enough Australia we need to act please press share please comment thank you very much

KZAqwvpbgCs,Medical cannabis maker spared jail for trying to help sick people | Today Show Australia,2019-11-20T01:00:00Z,"now our next guest has been through a really tough battle over the past three years fighting a drug conviction for illegally producing medicinal cannabis driven by a desire to help those in desperate need Jenny Hallam says she was let down by the system that doesn't allow patients to access proper pain relief last week South Australian woman Jenny Hallam was vindicated as she walked out of court a free woman she'd been facing drug supply and manufacturing charges after police raided her home in January 2017 finding hundreds of cannabis oil products that our 47 year old had been producing the drug and providing it to terminally ill adults and children for three years to help them overcome chronic pain giving relief to people like Ben Oakley who suffers from a rare neurological disease he was dying in front of my eyes and not one doctor was able to do anything for him Jenny also claims she'd healed her own pain through the drug and was providing it free of charge a key element that helped her case despite having to change her plea to guilty during a drawn-out court battle I'm sorry for those that I've let down basically I've taken this as far as I can possibly take it prosecutors argued that she was unlicensed and untrained I'm not a criminal but sometimes desperate people do desperate things but the judge accepted that Jenny was motivated by compassion and spared her from the maximum 10-year jail time handing her a two-year good behavior bond and no conviction and Jenny joins us now in the studio you're getting quite emotional watching that tape piece weren't you so you were facing ten years behind bars are you relieved or do you just feel worn down by this whole process a bit of both I'm relieved that the judge saw what I was doing for the right reasons but I'm also very worn down you know I don't think there was a reason to put me through that and was it hard to enter the conviction of guilty that you did because that was something that you were adamant you would never do but you've escaped conviction so how difficult was that that was one of the hardest days of this whole thing I never wanted to play guilty I was forced to play guilty the prosecution makes it very difficult for some of these cases to get brought to trial and he made sure mine did get to trial so it wasn't because I wanted to it was because I was forced to and and the reasons will come out eventually now you've been adamant all along that the laws need to change that they are not workable for providing access to medicinal cannabis are you prepared to break the law again no not this way I'm not going to provide oil for people anymore but I will keep fighting to make sure people who get access because I still have a powerful voice and I think that there's still something I can do with that they have taken away my ability to be able to heal people but they haven't taken my ability to be able to educate and help people to be able to help themselves and what doesn't need to change because people can get access to medicinal cannabis on paper but in practice is it a very different situation it's very different most people even if they can get access and can get prescription can't afford the products most people are looking at something like $6,000 per month's epilepsy patients probably even more this isn't a workable system there's no reason why I can't be put on the PBS you know we we just want the government to look at this and do something about it they legalized it in November 2016 and here we are in November 2017 sorry 19 and we still haven't got access for most people people are still dying children are still suffering and people are still messaging me on a daily basis begging for me to help them and I'm having to say no to these people in fact I can't even answer half of the messages because it's just too hard to listen to their stories of suffering and and desperation quite remarkable the comments that the judge made in delivering the the ruling - talking about you being an exceptional case and the miraculous results that you've delivered for the people that helped that's right and that's what we try to show is that you know everyone kept saying I'm not a doctor I shouldn't have done that but I think I've proven that you don't need to be a doctor to use cannabis and to treat yourself and even other people with cannabis it's a safe product it's not a drug it's not dangerous a lot of stuff was made up about it to try and scare people away from it when it was prohibited so they talk about it I'm causing mental health issues is not true it does not cause schizophrenia it does not cause mental health issues it does not cause a lot of the problems that they say it does other things doing the chemicals sometimes used to grow your cannabis can be a problem but organic full whole plant cannabis does not cause problems they try to make it sound like it does the only problems it causes are for the pharmaceutical companies because it is a huge threat to them they lose millions if not billions of dollars in profits and they are trying very very hard to make sure we don't get access to it here they donate money to political parties they bribe doctors even though it's not legal they still do it and they're making it very very difficult for us to be able to get access here you know the serious claims that you're making you've left South Australia do you feel like you've been handed over the state oh definitely definitely I feel like they're not happy with me they're not happy the fact that I got a no conviction they were trying to make an example of me that's why they went after me they thought if they take out someone that was compassionate there wasn't charging for it that helped all these people and if they went after me that they would scare everybody else off but it didn't scare anybody else it made everybody think well cannabis oil works and maybe I'll be able to use it and it made a whole lot of new people just want to try it so your voice is equally as loud as it's ever been it's blinded by this it's louder if they think that I'm going to give up there they're wrong they should have realized a long time ago that I'm not the weak sort of person that they assumed that I would be I have to fight for this for people that can't fight for themselves there's millions of people out there desperate to access cannabis both recreationally and medicinally and it's time this government had a look at it as time the government started listening to what the people wanted instead of what the big corporations that are paying them all this money want you know people put them in power we vote them in it's time to listen to us where the voices they should be listening to not the big bucks so what's next obviously if you you face jail time if you do take a stand how are you gonna go about making change then well I'll work legally so there are a couple of different companies that approached me about working legally with them I'll work legally in the future to do it I'll keep advocating for it I'll keep pushing the government and I'll keep showing that that what they're doing is wrong and that they're not trying as hard as what they pretend that they are I've sat down with Greg Hunt and spoken to him personally in the Health Minister Health Minister of the Federal Health Minister he has promised me that he would get access as soon as possible and then went behind our backs and did everything but that so we're tired of being lied to we know that there's a lot of money tied up in this we know that there's pharmaceutical companies that putting pressure on government and we want that to stop as time they stop listening to them and it's time they stop listening start listening to the people the ones out there that are sick and suffering and dying because we only get one chance at life these politicians can come back and have multiple chances at a political career but we get one chance at a life so we have a saying in our community and our little cannabis community out there that we would rather be illegally alive than legally dead and people out there will keep fighting and they'll keep using illegal products until they can access not only an affordable product but one that's works we can see your passion it's strong and we wait to see what happens next thank Jenny Hallam thank you so much for taking the time all right you"

f-TzrYGtva4,Medical Cannabis in IBD (Part 1),2019-02-26T18:15:05Z,my name is Arun Swamy not I'm an associate professor of medicine at the Hofstra School of Medicine I'm the director of the IBD program at Lenox Hill Hospital today our topic is medical cannabis as it relates to the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease and is being presented by the Crohn's and Colitis foundation so today we'll cover several topics in in our agenda we will talk about the cannabis timeline and legalization the medical effects of cannabis what are the data in patients with inflammatory bowel disease what about the terminology and medical legalization the different products that include medical cannabis medical cannabis and special populations such as pregnancy and pediatrics the Crohn's and Colitis foundation position statement on medical cannabis and ongoing research on cannabis in IBD you can see cannabis has been around for a really long time and actually dates back to almost 5000 years ago but the science of it was actually studied in more detail in the early 1900s in 1996 California became the first state to legalize marijuana although in 1971 it was scheduled as a Schedule one drug and was basically illegal as is a federal statute so the more recent history around care around cannabis in 1970 the Controlled Substances Act essentially classified marijuana as a schedule 1 drug which means that it has a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use in 1986 the first synthetic THC essentially the active ingredient in marijuana was manufactured and was Cauldron a banal and was approved for the management of AIDS cachexia and that was classified as a schedule 2 drug which meant that it was allowed to be prescribed by the medical community in 1996 California approves medical marijuana in 1999 during a banal antici were reclassified to schedule 3 multiple attempts for reclassification of marijuana from schedule one to schedule two or three have been ineffective in 2009 a Justice Department memo essentially deprioritized the prosecution of marijuana crimes in states where medical marijuana was legal in 2012 Colorado became the first state to approve recreational marijuana in 2018 the Attorney General at the time jeff sessions rescinded this memo and the existing laws against marijuana use possession and transportation may be prosecuted as a result this may be up to the individual states Attorney General's we have to wait and see as of November 2018 this is a map of the United States where the states in dark green have legalized cannabis for recreational use in light green these states have allowed marijuana for medical use and in gray they are prohibited from any use again these are state laws and differ from federal statute with still considers an illegal substance so an overview of cannabis and cannabis physiology cannabis contains over 500 chemical compounds with more than 60 unique cannabinoids that have individual effects cannabinoids are basically chemicals that can attach and activate the cannabinoid receptors in the body and they have downstream effects there are endogenous cannabinoids that are made in the human body and attached to cannabinoid receptors there are phyto cannabinoids that are made by plants such as cannabis sativa and there are synthetic cannabinoids that just turn a banal or other drugs that are made in the lab such as k2 or spice there are two principal cannabinoids that have been the most well studied in Canada as a byproduct of cannabis the first is THC which is Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol and CBD which is cannabidiol there is some understanding of why cannabis might work in inflammatory bowel disease to control symptoms and inflammation through the activation of the endocannabinoid system signaling systems found in all mammals regulate numerous body functions including cognition and memory coordination pain perception heart rate immune function appetite metabolism and Gi motility you can imagine to treat the complaints of inflammatory bowel disease having control over pain the immune function and Gi motility would be advantageous there are two well described cannabinoid receptors the first is C b1 which is highly expressed in the brain and various nervous system cells cb2 receptors are highly expressed in immune cells and some gut cells as well THC mainly activates the cb1 receptors and accounts for the psychoactive effects seen with marijuana or connect cannabis use and CBD binds cb1 and cb2 very weakly CBD has minimal psychoactive effects and mostly works through other cannabinoid receptors like GP r 55 and trpv1 so the effects of cannabis is mediated through the cannabinoid system which is typically mediated through cb1 and cb2 receptors activating cb1 and cb2 will increase cannabinoid tone blocking the effects of cb1 and cb2 will decrease cannabinoid tone these have clinical consequences decrease cannabinoid tone may decrease vomiting but increase diarrhea increasing cannabinoid tone will typically decrease heartburn complaints decrease vomiting decreased acid secretion decreased diarrhea and decreased visceral pain visceral pain a number of studies have pointed out that IBD patients to you cannabis and this was before it became decriminalized in the US and before it became legal to use in Canada which happened just recently in Canada 50 percent of IBD patients in one survey reported cannabis use and most often they used it to control complaints around pain diarrhea or appetite a study from Massachusetts found that increase in cannabis by patients with the IBD increased from about 12% in 2012 to 22% in 2017 after decriminalization more than 50% of patients said that legalization did not affect their likelihood of use in Colorado 32% of adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease have used cannabis and 9% in fact are habitual daily users and again the most common complaint that was addressed with use of cannabis was for complaints of abdominal pain in Connecticut up to 70% of pediatric IBD patients typically aged 18 to 21 have used cannabis in some manner and the vast majority of patients did not discuss their cannabis use with their gastroenterologists here we show the evidence from preclinical studies for the activity of cannabis in inflammatory bowel disease in animal models which have colitis that is chemically induced as well as gene knockout models there are clearly anti-inflammatory effects that have been noted across animal models and across different types of injuries in human preclinical studies these are typically immune system cells from patients with IBD or cells from intestinal biopsy of effective patient have also shown evidence of anti-inflammatory activity to summarize in animal models colitis can be improved or blocked by modulating the cannabinoid especially cb2 receptors cells from IBD patients show higher levels of endocannabinoids and cb2 receptors and CBD decreases Pro pro-inflammatory cytokines in mice models human immune system cells and cells from you see patients there are a number of survey studies and you can see them briefly summarized here in which patients were asked whether they used marijuana and if they did how much it helped them and what it helps them with you can see across studies there are improvements in pain dominoe pain diarrhea and improvements in appetite the nausea here we summarize some of the evidence for cannabis use and inflammatory bowel disease both in Crohn's and in ulcerative colitis in Crohn's disease much of the data has come from Israel specifically one author and ofte Lee and has been published in major journals the first paper that was published in 2013 looking at cannabis in the form of cigarettes administered twice a day with about a hundred fifteen milligrams of THC content versus placebo cigarettes they found that ninety percent of patients in the cannabis group compared to just 40 percent of patients in the placebo group had a clinical response as measured by improvement in CDA I and this was statistically significant patients also experienced improvements in the quality of life with cannabis use however all patients who achieve their response lost the response within two weeks of discontinuing cannabis suggesting that there was no change to the underlying biology with cannabis use an additional criticism was that patients who were receiving cannabis cigarettes could clearly tell the difference based on psychotropic effects compared to the placebo group which would not feel such effects and hence the study could not be truly blinded a second study looking just at CBD oil found that patients exposed to CBD versus placebo did not notice a significant benefit and one of the criticisms behind this study was whether this study used too low a dose of CBD to find any improvement and it was a small study in all sort of colitis CBD rich extract with about four point seven percent concentration of THC was used compared to placebo it's hard to reach any conclusions from this study because there were so many protocol deviations but it did show that there was an improvement in the partial Mayo score finally another study from nastily looking at cannabis cigarettes again two per day with the same amount of THC content were compared to placebo this is not a fully published paper but the early data showed that there are no changes in CRP or fecal calprotectin suggesting that there was no underlying improvement in the inflammation although the clinical score the licked agar score did show improvement the CRP is a blood biomarker that can reflect inflammation and patients and fecal calprotectin is a stool biomarker that reflects inflammation typically from the colon but also as well as small bowel hence improvements in blood CRP or stool fecal calprotectin will suggest that there is an improvement in the underlying inflammation as opposed to an improvement in diarrhea or pain that are not related to inflammation that are affected by changes to motility based on the underlying drug that's administered so are there benefits to using cannabis and patients with Crohn's disease the first small study showed a decreased jared requirement associated with the cannabis use again the question here is whether the underlying biology changed and hence the steroids were no longer required or whether the complaints that the steroids treated were also addressed by the cannabis such as pain and diarrhea but without any actual change to the inflammatory process the follow-up to the first randomized controlled trial in 21 patients showing the overall clinical improvement again this is an awfully trial showing that cannabis in the form of cigarette smoke twice a day for eight weeks did show an improvement in quality of life and that a significant number of patients achieve clinical ramesh but this wasn't statistically different and again the same criticism which is that there is no improvement in any meaning that patient's blood count did not improve and there was no improvement in the c-reactive protein which is again a blood biomarker of inflammation did not improve the data and ulcerative colitis is even more limited the first randomized control trial in sixty patients that were stable on this Alamein therapy only 59% of patients actually completed the treatment which is once daily CBD rich extract versus placebo and there was no difference in remission rate however there was a trend toward an improved quality of life an unpublished trial of medical cannabis with 28 patients smoking to cannabis cigarettes daily versus placebo did show an improvement in clinical symptoms and colonoscopy but again this is unpublished and we're unable to critique the study or to understand what exactly the endoscopy showed before and after treatment again it's significant to note that biomarkers such as the CRP and fecal calprotectin in this unpublished studies also did not improve so to summarize cannabinoids have been shown to reduce inflammation in different animal models of inflammatory bowel disease as well as human cell lines from patients with inflammatory bowel disease most patients surveys show that the majority of IBD patients who use cannabis note improvement in pain diarrhea appetite and nausea data from human trials of cannabis or cannabinoids lags behind and is far from conclusive in showing these same benefits there are several cannabinoids that are available commercially dronabinol which is a synthetic THC agent which was approved in the 90s for anorexia in HIV and AIDS patients and nausea and vomiting in patients with chemotherapy this is available in the US and is a scheduled three drug as well as available in other countries NAB alone which is a THC analogue has been approved to treat nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and is considered a schedule 2 drug in the United States and is available elsewhere the big-small which is a combination of THC and CBD has been approved to treat pain and multiple sclerosis outside the US specifically in Canada and Sweden an epidural X which is CBD is used to treat a rare form of pediatric epilepsy called the luna Gestalt syndrome and the dravet syndrome it has only just recently been approved in the US and the scheduling is still unclear there are risks associated with cannabis use and here we have a summary of the possible risks and the overall confidence in the statement that's made for example that there is a relationship to addiction or dependence to marijuana and other substances with marijuana use the data behind this is consistent and hence there is a high level of confidence in that statement unlike an association with lung cancer in which there are they low level of confidence there is an there are several things that should be highlighted including that there's a dependence issue with marijuana in adults it's about 9% in adolescents and children it's about 17% that there is an increase in motor vehicle accidents and typically that is much more severe impairment when marijuana is combined with alcohol that marijuana when it is delivered in a form of a cigarette can be associated with chronic bronchitis and that overall marijuana use in habitual users has been associated with a diminished lifetime achievement one of the risks specifically in patients with IBD most diabetes studies do not show any significant adverse effects with the caveat that the study sizes are small in total covering less than 130 patients and with only short-term follow-up there have been risks that have been shown in studies such as discontinuation of conventional therapy and hence an increased risk of relapse of the disease as well as an increase in risk for surgery and Crohn's disease and it's not clear whether this is truly related to marijuana use as opposed to discontinuing conventional therapy or the fact that these patients did not have benefits from conventional to

waka_zGXFb4,Medicinal Cannabis Scheme Health Professionals Session,2019-07-28T20:54:22Z,"So first of all, I'm just
saying that if you're here to learn more about the details
of the government's proposed referendum on the legalization
of recreational cannabis, you might have to
wait a bit longer. So the focus of this session
is on medicinal cannabis, and medicinal cannabis, which is
available only on prescription. New Zealanders will
choose whether or not to legalize recreational
cannabis as part of a referendum at the
2020 general election. So I'd like to introduce
Chris James, who's the group manager of Medsafe. Medsafe is New Zealand Medicines
and Medical Devices Safety Authority, which is the business
unit within the ministry responsible for the regulation
of therapeutic products in New Zealand. Chris. As Andrea mentioned,
I'm the group manager of Medsafe, medicines and
medical device regulator. Medsafe also regulates
psychoactive substances. And we're leading
the implementation of a medicinal cannabis scheme. Just a bit of background--
from my perspective, I've been at Medsafe
around 12 years, both in pre-market
pharm chem assessment, and then into clinical and
pharmacovigilance and risk management, and then
into management roles. Before that, I was a pediatric
and neonatal pharmacist for 10 years, in New
Zealand and the UK. Just a bit of
background for you. I know this is a health
professional session. And I imagine those
in the audience will have had some experience
with either medicinal cannabis products, or people
asking questions about medicinal
cannabis products, and patients
seeking information. So what we want to do
is really provide you with some information about what
is proposed here, and really get your feedback on
what you need, obviously what you think of the proposals,
and what you need as well, in terms of
information, to help you with those discussions
with patients. So a bit of background
to the scheme, so you know why we're here. The key objective that the
new government came in with was to improve access to
affordable, quality medicinal cannabis products. And to do this-- they see it as a
priority in what they call the 100-day plan. And that was to
introduce legislation that did a number of things. So the first one was to
provide a statutory defeat for terminally ill
people to possess and use illicit cannabis, on
compassionate grounds, and in principle, to introduce
a medicinal cannabis scheme that would provide an ability
to cultivate, manufacture, and supply medicinal cannabis
products to a quality standard. The legislation was also put
in place to de-schedule CBD, cannabidiol. So cannabidiol came out of
the Misuse of Drugs Act. But one of the key
things about that is it's still scheduled in
the Medicines Act. And this is where we've had a
little bit of confusion because of the two bits of legislation
that we have in New Zealand. So CBD, while it's
not controlled, is a controlled drug. It is still a
prescription medicine. So this legislation
entered parliament and was passed at the end
of last year, in December. And it's allowed for
people requiring palliation to be eligible for
statutory defense; allowed for regulations to
be made to describe standards for all stages in
the cultivation and manufacture
for these products; it also allows the license
holder, under the scheme, to use locally-sourced
plant, fruit, and seeds; and also required that the
regulations to actually make this live, make this
come into force, should be passed
within 12 months. And so that's basically
the 18th of December, which, for those who had
experience in government, is extremely fast. For those who have had
some knowledge about what's happened overseas, that's
about two to three times faster than any other country
has put this in place. Because of that, that's why we
have been in contact with all of our regulatory colleagues. Because it tends to be the
medicines regulator that is an offshoot of the
medicines regulator that is implementing
throughout the world. And so we've been able to use
our contacts to learn about what went well, and
what didn't go well, and what they would do
if they had the chance to plan it and do it again. So that's been quite helpful. A little bit of
international context on this, which really
steers us and as far as what we need to put in place. And there are a
number of conventions and international conventions
that New Zealand has signed up to that look to restrict
production, export, import, manufacture, et cetera
of narcotic drugs, including cannabis,
to be exclusively for medical and
scientific purposes. The key one is the
Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961. That establishes a framework
for control of narcotics to facilitate the
availability of these products as medicines or for
medical purposes. So under that
convention, New Zealand has to carefully control the
cultivation and manufacture, and also has to set up what's
called an agency to do that and to regulate
cannabis-based products. So by the term, I mean, agency-- what we tend to say is
agency with a little a, not a big A. You don't have
to have another department, and an office in Wellington
of 20 people just looking at medicinal cannabis,
it just means that you need to have a
regulator in place, which could be part of Medsafe and
within the Ministry of Health, to do that. The New Zealand
context around this is we have the Misuse
of Drugs Act, 1975. So it's not overly new, but
it serves a purpose for what we're trying to achieve here. We already have laws that
allow the import, export, and manufacture of
medicinal cannabis. These laws do not allow lawful
cultivation of cannabis plants for medicinal purposes,
for commercial purposes. What they do allow
is we can license for scientific and
medical research. And that is happening now. We are proposing to control the
supply of medicinal cannabis products through our
licensing regime, and that's effectively allowing
cultivation manufacture and supply commercially,
so products can be developed and
then essentially accessed to patients. And the proposal is that
this access to a patient is through a prescription. And then a prescription
is then presented, as with any medicine,
to a pharmacy. And then a pharmacy
dispenses that medicine. So obviously these
are all things that we're interested
in feedback on. The agency, as
I've mentioned, is to be established within
the Ministry of Health. We already administer aspects
of the Misuse of Drugs Act. We already license, for a
number of controlled drugs, for therapeutic purposes. We also regulate, for
example, industrial hemp, cultivation of low-grade
THC hemps for food. We do that with MPI. And as I mentioned,
we are already currently issuing licenses
for medical and scientific research. So with this in mind,
improving access to products-- there's two sides to this. The first is increasing
supply of products. There are, as you would
have seen, a few products. There is one approved
medicine-- it's called Sativex, which is
approved for spasticity in MS. And obviously there are a
couple of unapproved products which are in
circulation as well. Tilray is one, for instance,
that we commonly see. The legislation change here,
and what we're putting in place, is looking to increase
the supply of products that meet a quality standard. And that would allow--
so we're allowing commercial cultivation of
cannabis in New Zealand, manufacture of products
in New Zealand, and also local and
imported products, as long as they meet
the quality standards. The other side to this is about
improving access to patients. And this is around products
may be more available, but what reassurance do
health care professionals have about the products,
about what's in them, about the consistency,
about how they dose titrate, how they manage
interactions, how they manage adverse reactions. And that's where
a key part of this is how we provide information,
both with the actual products, because these products are
unlikely to have full data sheets like medicines
have now, with randomized controlled trials to phase
III level, with thousands of patients. We are expecting to have
information about products, such as formulation
and clinical data that they do have available. But then we're also
looking at what information do we need to provide to
health care professionals generally about
medicinal cannabis products as new evidence
and new clinical studies come through, including, for
instance, a lot of research happening in pharmacokinetics. What are we seeing in
terms of inhibition of PGP and hepatic enzymes. What does that mean
for interactions? And so we need to provide that
information for health care professionals so you can
make decisions and have conversations with patients. So that's it for me for now. I'll hand over to Andrea
about quality standards of manufacture, and then
we'll cover off prescribing. OK, thanks, Chris. I'm going to talk now
about quality standards, and cover off a wee bit
about the manufacture. Because they manufacture
quality standard is a key part of the quality
assurance of a product. And then I'm going to talk a wee
bit about the product quality standards in the
finished dose forms that we are proposing to be
allowed under the scheme. So why are quality
standards important? I think you'll all agree
that the key objective here is to protect the patient. So people who use
medicines expect that they will meet appropriate
standards of quality, regardless of the reason why
they are using that medicine. So there is a potential
for harm to the patient if the medicines don't contain
the right active ingredients and the right dosage, or if
they contain harmful substances like pesticides, heavy
metals, or microbiological contamination, or
even if they are not manufactured,
transported, or stored under the right conditions. So when we're talking
about quality standards, we can set quality standards
under the scheme for a process or for a product. So we are proposing here
to set quality standards for cultivation manufacture,
the active pharmaceutical ingredients, and the
finished products. We are going to be setting
quality standards for all of these stages, but I
just want to talk a wee bit about the quality
standards for manufacture. Because as I said before,
it's a key part of the quality assurance of the product. So when we looked at what
quality standards should be set for these products in
terms of the manufacturing, there are two main
options that we looked at. The first is the
New Zealand approach for the manufacture
of medicines, as outlined in the New Zealand
Code of Good Manufacturing Practice. And I'll refer that now to
refer to that now as GMP, because it's quite a bit
of a mouthful to say. GMP ensures that products
are produced consistently and are of a reliable,
high quality. So this is a system that we use
for medicines in New Zealand. And it's based on an
internationally-recognized system. Within Medsafe, we already
have that system set up. We have a system of auditing,
and we have staff that go out and they issue these
certificates of GMP compliance. The other system that we
looked at, and was one that was flagged with us quite
often by stakeholders, whether it's
industry or patients, it's called GPP, Good
Production Practices. And that's the approach that
they've taken in Canada. So when we looked at the
Canadian approach and GPP-- and I'll go into a wee bit
about the differences now, but the Canadian
approach does have a system for
prescription medicines, similar to New Zealand. Prescription
medicines are required to be manufactured to GMP. And like New Zealand,
they are subject to pre-market
authorization before they can be sold in New Zealand. Canada also have a category
called non-prescription health products containing
cannabis, which can be processed according to GPP. However, this doesn't apply
to manufactured medicines as we know it. It applies to certain
classes of cannabis, which is the fresh and dried
cannabis and cannabis oils. And in those classes, you
can only have cannabis plant. So the fresh and dried can
only be cannabis plant, and the cannabis
oils are allowed to have a small amount
of carrier oils. But essentially, the oils have
to be derived from the cannabis plant. And later on this
year, Canada will also be introducing regulation
that allows edible cannabis and topical cannabis. So what is the difference
between these two from a technical point of view? So when we laid the two
processes side by side, they were very similar. Both set out the principles
that you have to comply with. But the difference
is, with GMP, there is a code of practice,
which gives you detailed guidance on how
you might comply with that. So the way the codes
operate is that you can have a code of
practice, and if you follow the code of
practice, then you are seen to be complying
with the principles. However, the code doesn't say
you must comply with the code. You can innovate, you
can find another way of meeting those principles. But the onus will be
on the manufacturer to prove that what
they are doing also meets those principles. Under GPP, we have
those principles. And while the guidance
is developing, there isn't clear
guidance on how you might comply with those principles. That means the
manufacturer has to decide how they are going to comply
with those principles, but less detailed and
open to interpretation. So the manufacturer will
have to decide how they can comply with those principles. And on the others other
end of the spectrum, the regulator then has
to decide whether what the manufacturer is doing
meets those principles. So on both sides, it's
open to interpretation, but it's not as clear on what
you have to do to meet those. Another key difference
is the validation program is required under GMP
but not under GPP. And stability testing
is required under GPP. So why is this important? What this key
difference means is that the consistency of the
product is not guaranteed. But the validation program means
that those quality requirements are built into every step of
the manufacturing process. So you have that assurance that
what comes out of the other end is consistent, within a
batch and between batches. So within the same
bottle of pills-- so I can use that
as an example-- every single dose is the same. And between-batch
consistency means the batch that was
produced a month ago is the same dose
as a batch that is produced in three months' time. Stability testing is,
as some people know that with the cannabis-based
products, some of it degrades over
time, and there are changes to the key cannabinoid
profile within the batches. So stability testing
is very important. That tells you how
long a product will last for in its current form. So the GMP production practices,
manufacturing practices, are adopted by such countries
as those in the EU, Australia, and Japan. Canada, at the moment,
is the only jurisdiction that adopts the GPP approach. So the options here we
have for manufacture are to adopt the
New Zealand approach and require GMP
for all products, or to adopt the New Zealand
approach, but as with Canada, allow for some forms of products
to be manufactured to GPP, as in Canada. But also I'd like to reiterate
that, in Canada, they still have a medicines regime
similar to New Zealand. So the Canadian
approach only talks about these specific
product forms, fresh and dried cannabis
and cannabis oils. So we're seeking information
from industry on what the setup costs are, how long it will
take to get products to market, and what the finished
products costs are. And we're after a comparison. So the other thing
about GPP and Canada and these health products
containing cannabis is they exist through
these products or through a medical
document from a doctor. So there's not a prescription. So this medical document
authorizes the patients to access products through
one of three ways-- to grow their own, to get
someone to grow it for them, or to buy it directly
from a producer. But that is only for those
three forms of cannabis. In terms of time to
get products to market, we don't have that information. But we have asked
for information-- we've asked industry
to provide information on that if they can. But we also went
to the Australians and asked them how long it took
them to get products to market. Now, they implemented their
regime in October 2016, and they're just starting to
see the first products come through now. So that's 2 and 1/2 years since
the scheme was implemented. So we're going to learn
from their experiences. And we've been talking to
industry about how long it took them to get
things to market, and what were the things that
we could do to speed that up. So we think we can do
better than 2 and 1/2 years, but we are seeking information
on how we can make that easier. So just a word on the finished
dose forms under the scheme-- products for smoking
will not be allowed, but we are going to allow
products for vaping. What we consider to be
the higher-risk dose forms, like modified-release
dose forms and medicines that are required to
be sterile, we are asking that they go through
a proper risk assessment. So they'll only
be allowed if they are approved or provisionally
approved by the ministry. The Food Act does
not allow products to be put in food that are
prescription medicines. So food containing
cannabis will not be allowed under the Food Act. Because there is no regulatory
regime for natural health products, then cannabis-based
dietary supplements, natural health products,
and nutraceuticals must also meet the
requirements of the scheme. So I'd like to now
hand it back to Chris to talk about the
prescribing requirements. Right. So the prescribing
requirements, which I imagine will be quite of
interest to this group. So what I'll just talk
about is approved, versus provisionally
approved, versus unapproved. And apologies if I tell you
stuff that you already know. But I'll just go through
it quickly for you. We'll go through
what's not changing, and then the proposals
that we're putting forward for change. So to cover off, firstly,
a couple of explanations. So approval, which you'll
probably be aware of, is approval or conceit. It says conceit in
the Medicines Act. We tend to use
the word approval, because no one really
knows what conceit means. Well, we do, but when
we use that wording, it's not overly
helpful sometimes. So we say it's approval
to distribute a medicine. This is we're supporting
information on clinical safety and efficacy as assessed by
Medsafe and by the ministry. And then we have an approval
under the Medicines Act. There's also a
provisional approval ability in the
Medicines Act, and we've used this in the past. Well, we use it still currently. But it's a provisional
early approval-- it can be. It can also be an approval
that we use to put conditions on certain medicines. So we've used it in the past
for things like antiretrovirals. So when there was a
very high clinical need and the clinical
data coming through was actually quite
limited at the time, those medicines were given
a provisional approval. We've also used provisional
approval for [? Clonazepam ?] to ensure that it was a white
cell count system in place, a monitoring system in place. So that's the way
that you can actually enforce it as part of the
approval of the medicine. So that's what we mean
by provisional approval. In terms of clinical need, if
you have high clinical need and low access to
a product, there is a case-by-case
assessment that you might look at for what
level of clinical data do you require to give
a provisional approval. So is that preclinical, was
it phase 2, is that phase 3? Where does that set? And so around the
world, there are a lot of new initiatives
coming through from regulators that are looking at
early access approvals. So Europe's got prime, the FDA
had their 21st Century Cures Act, and Japan has the
[INAUDIBLE] process, which is looking at
either rolling submissions and approvals, or how you
give an early approval, say, at phase II studies,
with real-world evidence, post-market, coming
through, which may then lead to a full approval. Our provisional approval
provides this ability for us. Just something I wanted
to explain to you. The other point that
we wanted to raise was about unapproved
products, where safety, quality,
and efficacy has not been assessed by the ministry. Now, prescribing requirements
that we're looking at is the no change. So looking at what we're
not going to change-- CBD products, no change there. This is CBD products that
meet the definition where they contain less than
2% of the cannabinoid THC or other controlled drugs
or psychoactive substances. Obviously there
is a change, which mean they came out of
the Misuse of Drugs Act, but we're not looking at
a change to prescribing. So approved or provisionally
approved CBD products can be prescribed by a
medical practitioner-- or a nurse practitioner,
for instance-- any authorized prescriber. Unapproved CBD products
can only be prescribed by a medical practitioner. And for those
wondering why that is, that's because we have
a Medicines Act 1981. And when that was written,
unapproved products could only be prescribed
by medical practitioners. And we're currently looking
at changing the Medicines Act and bringing in the
Therapeutic Products Bill, which was actually out for
consultation a couple of months ago. Obviously that's going to
look to modernize prescribing and modernize our workforce
and how we enable our health workforce for New Zealand. But that's, frankly, a
couple of years away. So I just wanted to provide
that background for you. The other thing
we're not changing is unapproved products. So unapproved products
that aren't CBD products, so they are still
controlled drugs that do not meet the quality standard. That is confirmed, obviously,
by the end of the year. We're looking at no
change to prescribing, which means specialists
can prescribe, but you still have to come
through the Ministry of Health for individual approval. Now, what are our proposals? And some of these
proposals have had a lot of feedback, which is great. We've seen a lot of
feedback in the media as well, both last week
and also yesterday. This is all very
helpful for us when we're looking at
consultation and submissions. Now, to break this down,
approved products-- so these are approved
medicinal cannabis products such as Sativex,
that we have now. So on-label use is
effectively when you're using a medicine
that's approved for what it's approved for. So Sativex is approved
for spasticity in multiple sclerosis, and
it's called on-label use. Off-label uses is when you
use Sativex for anything else, which is what you can do. And you can prescribe,
and it's fine. But that's the difference
between the two. So for on-label use,
we are proposing that they can be prescribed
by any medical practitioners. But we will remove
the requirement for specialist recommendation
which we currently have in place. For off-label use,
it can be prescribed by medical practitioners,
remove the requirement for ministry approval, but
specialist recommendation is still required. So at the moment, for
off-label use for Sativex, every application has to
come through the ministry. You need, for instance,
your general practitioner to prescribe it. And then have a
specialist endorse that. We're looking at the specialist
recommendations still applying, but then you won't have to come
through the Ministry of Health. Obviously keen for
feedback on that. Unapproved products that meet
the quality standard-- and this is slightly
different to when you use everything else unapproved. As a health care professional
under section 29, unapproved medicinal cannabis
products that we have assessed to meet the quality standard--
so they won't have all of the clinical
data behind them-- we're looking for, can be
prescribed by specialists, but remove the requirement to
come to the Ministry of Health for approval. And also add the provision
for medical practitioners to prescribe with a
specialist's recommendation. Now, just a bit of
information about unapproved medicinal
cannabis products. We are expecting,
in the short term-- and some of this will be
around industry gearing up once we have
regulations in place and once cultivation and
manufacture is happening-- that, in the short
term, we expect it is likely to be
mainly imported products, and with varying degrees
of clinical information around the clinical
efficacy and safety. Now, obviously, the research
and the clinical studies are evolving. They're growing very quickly. We're seeing a lot of research
in Australia, a lot of research in Canada and in Europe. We know that some products
that are unapproved are in different
phases of studies for particular indications. But at the moment, they are all
unapproved apart from Sativex in New Zealand. So the intent of the scheme
is to make products easier to access by not requiring
the full randomized controlled trial
data package that you would have with a medicine. We understand it would
be a major barrier to these products, but ensuring
that we know the quality aspects of these products. So if you're looking
to prescribe these, not only are we looking
at providing information on evidence and how the
evidence is coming through, and clinical studies
are coming through around medicinal
cannabis use, but making sure that the quality
of the products, you know what
you're prescribing, so you know what you're you
talking to your patients about. And that depends where the
quality standard lands. So Andrea has talked
about GMP versus is other quality standards. With GMP for instance, you
know that the bottle of liquid, your spray that you
gave to a patient, is going to be the
same consistency and makeup as the next bottle. And that's under GMP. Whereas if you test
a batch of product under a different
standard, you may have batch-to-batch inconsistency. You may have levels
going up and down. That's something
we want feedback on from health care
professionals, about how much reassurance do you
want on these products to give you confidence
to prescribe them and confidence to use
them on your patients. We're also seeking feedback on
barriers to access and barriers to access for patients. So this is around
prescribing requirements. We've obviously got a number
of specialist recommendations in there-- is that an
unnecessary barrier, do you think it should be in place? Really keen for
feedback on that. The consultation
period-- next steps are-- so this goes for four weeks,
until the 7th of August. We know this is short. We tend to go out
for consultation a lot longer than that. But as I mentioned,
18th of December is hurtling towards us. We've got 12 months
to do this, so we've had to do this in
four weeks, and that's why we're coming out and going
both to Auckland, Christchurch, and Wellington, to hold sessions
and informed submissions, and get as much
feedback as we can. Stakeholder groups,
I've talked about, who we're going to go
in and talk to directly. We'll also be
targeting some groups. We're going to the
provisional bodies. And depending on who
attends our health care professional sessions,
we'll be wanting to talk to, for instance,
Royal College of GPs, be talking to various
medical professional bodies. We'll also be talking to the
pharmacy professional bodies, the Pharmacy Counseling
Society, et cetera. The next step, really, is
we have a Medicinal Cannabis Advisory Group, which that
has around 13 members, and has representation
of our consumers, and for industry, and for
health care professionals. So it's chaired
by Russell Wills, who is a pediatrician from
the Hawke's Bay, ex-children's commissioner. And they've helped us to craft
the consultation document, and to fine-tune it,
and give us advice. We'll be going back to
them with what we've seen, key themes from the
consultation process, and help to arrive at what
are our actual regulatory proposals, that we'll be
then putting up to cabinet for approval of draft
regulations in October, and for cabinet to approve
those regulations in December, by the 18th of December. We then expect-- so as far as
the legislative process goes, you then have a 28-day-- what's effectively stand-down
period, which then takes us into [INAUDIBLE] in January. We also have, obviously,
a close-down period over holidays. We are looking at implementing
this scheme as soon as possible after that, after
the 18th of December. Now, you can't
confirm everything until you have
approved regulations. Because if regulations
change, and you've done an awful lot
of implementation, you need to change it all. But what we're doing is trying
to run our regulations process and our implementation process
in parallel as much as we can, because we want to have this in
place as quickly as possible. And we're looking for
the first quarter of 2020 to be able to
receive applications. Thank you. That's all we have to talk
to you about at the moment. Very keen to have you feedback. You can do that
through an online tool on Ministry of Health website. If you go onto the Ministry of
Health website, health.govt.nz, and put medicinal
cannabis into the search field in the top
right corner, it comes up with all the
documentation and all the consultation
information, and how you can make a submission. Let us know what you think. Thank you."

wXMLZoF50gs,Medicinal Cannabis Scheme Industry Session,2019-07-28T20:54:22Z,"First of all, I was
just saying upfront, if you're here to learn more
about the government's proposed referendum on the legalization
of recreational cannabis, you may need to
wait a little bit longer because
this session isn't about recreational cannabis. This is about the
medicinal cannabis scheme, which covers medicinal cannabis
products which are only available on prescription. So it's through
the medical model. New Zealanders will
choose whether or not to legalize or regulate
medicinal cannabis as part of a referendum to be held
as part of the 2020 election. So we're not going to talk
about the referendum today. So just on this slide, this is
an industry-focused session. So we're going to talk about
the background to the scheme, the context, and how
we can improve access to medicinal cannabis products. What will probably be
of great interest to you all is the quality standards
in the licensing scheme. So we're going to cover that and
then talk about the prescribing requirements. So now, I will ask Chris to come
and talk about the background to the scheme. I'm going to talk
about why we're here, medicinal-cannabis-wise,
and how we got here, and what we're
trying to achieve. And then Andrea
will go through some of the more detailed stuff
around quality standards in licensing. Just as a bit of
intro about me, so I'm group manager of Medsafe. Medsafe, for those
who don't know, is the medicines/medical device
regulator in New Zealand. Plus, we also regulate a
number of other areas-- psychoactive substances. We license pharmacies. We do some work under
the Misuse of Drugs Act. And we also regulate hemp. Well, it is part of the
Misuse of Drugs Act. And we're also responsible
for implementing the medicinal cannabis work. So I'm a pharmacist by training. I worked for about 10 years
in pediatrics and neonatology in hospitals in the
UK and New Zealand, and then came back and joined
Medsafe about 12 years ago. So came in as a pharmaceutical
chemistry assessor, and then moved into clinical
and risk communication and [? then ?]
[? into ?] management. I've been group manager
for around five years now. Now, a number of you in the
audience, we've met with. And we've found those
interactions really helpful in this work and with
medicinal cannabis. And a number of
you, this will be new to you around
what we're doing here. So what we want you
to get out of this, what we're trying to achieve-- what the proposals are,
what the questions are, and the information that
we're keen to get back from all of the groups,
such as yourself-- keen to answer questions, to
help with your submissions, and to help you understand what
is in the consultation document and clarify any points
that may be in there. So I'll move on to-- really why we're
here-- the background. And the wording in red
is so we all remember what we're trying to achieve. So the government's
objective here is to improve access to
affordable, quality medicinal cannabis products for
people in New Zealand. Now, in doing that, this
was part of a 100-day plan for the incoming government. And the government committed
to introducing legislation to provide an exception
in statutory offense for terminally ill
people to possess and use illicit cannabis on
compassionate grounds, and, in principle, to introduce
a medicinal cannabis scheme. And that was to enable the
cultivation, manufacture, and access to medicinal cannabis
products made to a quality standard. The legislation
was also designed to deschedule
cannabidiol, or ""CBD"" as it's commonly referred
to, so it would no longer be a controlled drug. Now, there is a
slightly confusing part of the legislation in New
Zealand, in that we have the Misuse of Drugs Act that
puts controls and restrictions on certain substances, such
as cannabis, such as morphine, such as heroin-- various other products
that are restricted. And that's what the
Misuse of Drugs Act does. There is also the Medicines
Act, which puts restrictions on medicines, what's
scheduled as a medicine, how you can obtain them, can you
get them from a prescription, can you get it through
pharmacy, can you get them in the supermarket, who can
prescribe, various controls in [? there. ?] So with CBD, I'll just
cover that off now. So with the legislation
change, CBD came out of Misuse of Drugs Act. So it's no longer controlled
from the Misuse of Drugs Act, but remains a
prescription medicine. And that's something
that we have seen some confusion around when
that mode of change was made. I'll talk a bit about
what we can look and what industry
can do about CBD, and whether it should stay
a prescription medicine or whether it should be more
widely accessed in the future. So the Misuse of
Drugs Act amendment came into effect
in December, 2018. It was enacted in
December, 2018. What it did is people
requiring palliation were eligible for the
statutory [? event. ?] And it allowed
regulations to be made for all stages of
cultivation and production and manufacture
and [? sitting ?] quality standards. So it allows a license
holder under the Misuse of Drugs Act the cannabis scheme
to use locally sourced cannabis plants, fruits, and
seeds, and requires regulations on the quality
standards to be made. And these are to be made no
later than the 18th of December this year. And this is one
of the reasons why we're having a four-week
consultation period. This is very quick in
terms of implementation to get regulations in place. It's around two to three times
quicker than any other country has attempted to do. And that's why we are having
to really squeeze this in, so we can make sure we get
those regulations passed by the 18th of December. Now, the blue parts of the
scheme up here of the slide talk about the medicinal
cannabis scheme. And this is around
the expectation-- so the agency will be
operational very soon after the 18th of December date. So in law, when you
have regulations passed, you have a number of things,
such as a 28-day rule. And also, obviously,
there's a Christmas period and closed down. And there's
information to be put in place that can't be finalized
until the regulations are confirmed. And it's things like, what
are the actual forms that need to be put in place? What guidance is there? And so we expect the agency
to be operational very soon after the 18th of December. So just a bit of
international context for you on what we're working on
to establish the scheme. There isn't a
national context here. There are a number of
international agreements that New Zealand
has signed up to, that they aim to restrict
production, manufacture, export, import, imposition
of narcotic drugs, including cannabis. And that's exclusively
for medical and scientific purposes. And the most relevant one
here that we're looking at is the single convention
of narcotic drugs in 1961. And that establishes a framework
to prevent abuse and diversion of controlled drugs,
but also to facilitate the availability for medical
and scientific purposes. So under that
convention, New Zealand has an obligation to carefully
control and supervise and report on the various stages
of cultivation and production. Now, it also means that
New Zealand is required to establish an agency. And the agency is here to
regulate the cultivation and manufacture in supply. Now, a number of countries have
done this in different ways. And they all interpret
it in different ways. We've looked at all
of these countries. Germany has recently put in
place a state-run scheme. We're looking at what Canada has
done over the number of years since they've provided access
to medicinal cannabis products. And also, there's
obviously the US, where they have both
the federal laws but also the state laws, which
can sometimes contradict. But what we're looking at is
putting in a pragmatic solution that allows us to align
with our conventions that the New Zealand
government signed up to, while also we're
expecting to enable improved access for patients. Some New Zealand
context on this. We talked about the Misuse of
Drugs Act, which was very old-- 1975. This is what we administer. And this legislation already
allows the import, export, and manufacture of
medicinal cannabis products, but do not allow the lawful
cultivation of cannabis plants for medicinal purposes. So we are proposing to control
the medicinal cannabis supply chain through licensing
activities and having licenses for cultivation,
manufacture, and supply. As these are
prescription medicines-- so all medicinal cannabis
products will be prescription medicines at this stage-- patient access will be
through a prescription from a medical professional. I have a little bit
more on that later, after Andrea has talked about
the manufacturing standards and licenses. So the agency being
put in place-- effectively, we're
already able to license under Misuse of Drugs
Act for research and scientific
research purposes. And we're already licensing for
hemp production, for instance. So this is just another
stage in the path for us, obviously, to enable
medicinal cannabis products to be produced and manufactured
for commercial reasons. So the scheme has two
main parts, really. Obviously, we're looking to
improve access for patients with products being made
to a quality standard. We're also looking at increasing
the supply of products, having a sustainable
industry in New Zealand, for commercial cultivation,
and for manufacture made to minimum
standards, enabling, also, ongoing import of products
to encourage competition and to improve affordability-- and also improving
access for patients by ensuring medical
practitioners have confidence in what
they are prescribing. So this is where we
get the classic balance of quality standards
versus cost, but also versus confidence from
those health care professionals that will be prescribing
for patients. The minimum standards--
obviously, they provide assurance of quality. We're also looking for
providing information for health care professionals. These, in most cases, won't
be like traditional medicines, where if you have a medicine
approved in the Medicines Act, you have a full medicine data
sheet with all clinical data and all information
for a prescriber who can talk through with a
patient on risks and benefits for that patient. And that includes not
just how you use it, but also possible side effects,
any possible interactions. Now, with medicinal
cannabis products, this information is not
routinely available. But there is a huge amount of
research that is happening now and is starting to come through. And so one of the key challenges
for this scheme is to make sure health care
professionals and consumers have the information they
need to make choices-- know how to use these products,
know how to dose titrate, know how they may
interact with medicines that the patient's already
on, how do you monitor them. And that's one of the
key parts of the scheme, because if we don't provide
that information for health care professionals, they're
unlikely to prescribe them. So that's the intro. I'll hand over to
Andrea now who can go through some of the detail
around quality standards and licensing. And then I'll come
back and talk to you about some of the
prescribing requirements. Thanks. So I'm first of all going to
cover the quality standards, which cover cultivation,
manufacture, and finished products. So why are the quality
standards important? At the moment, we
are having products coming into New Zealand which
don't have those quality standards. But the reason why
they are important is to protect the patient. If there are no requirements
for quality, we get some things. We get potential for harm
if they don't, for example, contain the right
active ingredients in the right dosage or they
contain harmful substances, like pesticides,
heavy metals, or microbiological contamination. If they're not
manufactured, transported, or stored under the
right conditions, then that could affect the
quality of the product. So it is very important. And it's one of the key
components of the scheme, is to introduce making these
products to a minimum quality. So as I said earlier,
the quality standards can be set for a process like
cultivation or manufacture. And they can also
be set for products. So let's start with cultivation. I know that there are a number
of people in this room that have already engaged
with us to put in the applications for license
for cultivation for research or medical purposes. So let's start with cultivation. We're seeking feedback
on three options. The first one is
that the cultivator must meet the manufacturer's
quality requirements. So the manufacturer sets
these quality requirements for the cultivation process
or the starting material. This would be a good
thing in the case that a manufacturer
knows what they are going to do with the product. In some cases, if they are going
to process it in a minimal way and just compress it and
maybe use it for vaping, then it's quite appropriate to
set high standards of quality to make sure there is no
pesticide contamination or mold on the product. In other cases, they may be
taking that starting material and processing it further, in
which case some of those things can be managed throughout
the manufacturing process. So in this option,
the manufacturer decides and has a contract
with their cultivator. Or if he or she grows the
cultivation themselves, then they will set what
standards they require of that. The second option
is for the regulator to set a cultivation
process standard. And a number of things
have been discussed over the years with industry,
things like Good Agricultural Practice or the New
Zealand equivalent of agricultural
practice, like Growsafe. And then there are all these
international documents like the WHO Good Agricultural
Practice Standard. Those are ones that
could be set here. And then the regulator would
audit this cultivator's agricultural practices against
the cultivation process standard. There will, of course, be
cost involved in all of this. The third option is to set
a product quality standard for the starting material, which
are set by the regulator, which would be similar to our
product quality standards and would specify the limits
and amounts of ingredients that the starting material
may contain or not contain, such as pesticides
or heavy metals. And the cultivator would
then test each batch of starting material to ensure
it meets the quality standard and provide evidence
of compliance. So again, this involves
the regulator auditing the cultivator. So I guess that what we're
seeking through consultation is what industry think about
either of those three options. So this is a key thing for
you to put in your submission. The other area of intense
interest to people is the quality standards
for manufacture. So what I want to talk
about in this session, because a lot of
people have asked us-- not only industry,
but consumers as well, because it does affect access-- what about the
Canadian approach? Which is what we call ""GPP,""
Good Production Practices. And this is also versus
the New Zealand approach to the manufacture of
medicines, which is GMP. So I do want to
spend a bit of time. Because we have gone and
looked at GPP as an option, I just want to
spend a bit of time explaining what the
differences are so that you can understand that. Because it's not is
as simple as just having a set of rules which are
lot less stringent and easier to comply with and all of that. It has flow on effects. And the GPP system in Canada
is quite different from what we are trying to do here. So first of all, there is
the New Zealand approach to the code for the
manufacture of medicines. So this is known
as the New Zealand Code of Good Manufacturing
Practice, GMP. So I'm going to
use ""GMP"" from now on, because it's a
bit of a mouthful. So GMP ensures that products
are produced consistently and are of reliable,
high quality. It's based on an internationally
recognized system and Medsafe has all those
systems and processes set up for people to be audited and
to get a certificate of GMP. Now, the Canadian
approach is something that we looked at
in great detail. And we started off
by saying, well, what is the difference
between GMP and GPP? And on the face of it, when
we laid the two systems side by side, we sort of
figured out that there was very little difference
in the high level principles. So both GMP and GPP set out
those high level principles. What GMP does as
a code is set out some guidance on how you can
comply with those principles. So the way a code
functions is that it would set out this guidance. But if you want to do
something differently, then you have to
demonstrate how that what you're doing differently
meets the requirements of GMP-- meets the principles,
in other words. So it does provide
flexibility for you to do things and innovate
and do things in another way. But essentially, if you
comply with the code, then you are seen
to be complying with the principles of GMP. GPP, on the other hand, also
sets out those same principles. But while the [? guidance ?]
is developing on that, it just sets out the
principles and says, OK, Mr. Manufacturer or
Mrs. Manufacturer, you tell us how you're going to
comply with these principles. So it's very much open
to interpretation. When we went to look
at the Canadian system, we found out that prescription
medicines like the New Zealand system are required to
be manufactured to GMP and there is a
premarket authorization process and a whole system
set up for medicines, which is almost-- we hadn't gone into the great
detail of whether it's exactly the same. But that's like the New Zealand
system for the manufacture of medicines. So they already have an approach
for prescription medicines. But in addition, Canada then
decided that they would put in the system of GPP for what
they called ""non-prescription health products
containing cannabis."" Now the key difference here
is that it only applies to the non-prescription
classes of cannabis, like fresh and dried
cannabis and cannabis oils. And later on this
year, they will be adding to that list
edibles and topical creams. So there's the difference. There's a reason why they call
it ""good production practices"" as opposed to ""manufacturing
practices,"" just to highlight what the difference is, and
also because they are minimally processed. So these products are only
allowed to contain cannabis, and with a little
bit of allowance for carrier oils and
the cannabis oils. So essentially, they are
not prescription medicines as we know them. And I think that is
a key difference. The other difference,
which I won't go into, or Chris won't be
going into later on with the prescriptions,
is that access to these non-prescription health
products containing cannabis is through going
to see your doctor and getting a medical document. So the system in Canada, it's
not the same as a prescription because there isn't
that oversight. But the Canadians spent
a lot, lot of time looking at the access
model, and basically saying that you can get a medical
document from your doctor that will enable you to
either grow your own, get someone to grow it for you,
or get it from the producer. So that is something
that we haven't looked at in terms of these
non-prescription health products containing cannabis. We are looking here about
prescription medicines and making that available
through the prescription process. So when we were challenged
by our medicinal cannabis advisory group to
say, well, what actually is the difference? And so we went
into great detail. As I mentioned, the
GMP process gives you a code which provides you with
detailed compliance on how to comply. The GPP system is less detail. It just sets out a
set of principles and said, tell me
how you are going to achieve these outcomes. That in itself is
probably a lot more work, because then industry
will then have to interpret those
principles and come up with a way of meeting them. From a regulator
point of view, we are then going to have
to go into detail on what the manufacturer is proposing
to do and then assess whether or not we think those
will meet the principles. So there's quite a bit of
interpretive work on both sides and, I would imagine, quite
a bit of toing and froing. However, if I was industry,
what I'd be going is to say, what's GMP? What are the GMP requirements? And that would be
my starting point. But then that's
entirely up to industry. There are two other
key differences which are part of GMP
which are not part of GPP. One is a validation
program which is inherent in every step of
the production process for GMP. Why is that important? Because it ensures
that the product that you have come
out the other end is consistent within a batch. So the same bottle of
pills, for example, that came out of a batch, every
pill, every dose is the same. And it's the same as one that
was manufactured a month ago or six months into the future. It provides that consistency. And that's really important as
far as medical professionals are concerned. Because if they are
going to prescribe it, then they want to know that
whatever they're prescribing is going to be the
same every time. The other issue is
stability testing required. And with the medicinal
cannabis products, there isn't a lot
of information that has been done about how
stable the products are-- whether or not
what you buy today is still going to have the
same active ingredients six months down the track, how
long will it be stable for. And this is the approach taken
in most other jurisdictions. Canada, at the moment, is the
only one that requires GPP. So they don't have the
validation program, and they don't have
stability testing. And Canada, while their
GPP requires batch testing, that only says that the
dose that you are testing meets the requirements
of the finished product. It doesn't say whether all
the other doses in that pack meet those requirements
or whether it's the same as the one you
manufactured one month ago or six months into the future. So these are the key
differences between GMP and GPP. And I am highlighting
these because that's what may be important when we
get them to the prescribing. What do prescribers want? So here are the two options. And then there are
probably others. And if you have
alternative options, then please feel free to tell us
through the submission process. So adopting the New
Zealand approach to the manufacture of medicines,
which is basically saying, requiring GMP for all products,
or adopt the New Zealand approach and, like Canada,
allow for some forms of products to be manufactured
to GPP, as in Canada. This was something
that we would look at. But in Canada, be aware
that it only applies to fresh and dried and oils. As I said, the advisory
group challenged us to set out, what exactly
are the differences, and beyond actually what
the manufacturer has to do? What are the setup costs? How much does it cost to set
up a GMP facility versus a GPP facility? And how long will it take
an under/either option will it take to get
products to the market? And then, what impact does it
have on finished product cost? And on setting up a
regulatory regime, these are the
challenges that we are going to have to balance
about whether the regulatory requirements will result
in two higher cost products or setting the
regulatory requirements at a level that gives us
that assurance of quality. So the ideal situation
is for us to see it reasonable
standards of quality and that will result
in lower cost products. So the setup cost, there
are some suggestions that we could start with
GPP and move to GMP. So we have been talking to
some of the Canadian industry and the Canadian regulators
and say, how about this? Could we start with GPP
and move towards GMP? Now, we don't have
anything concrete on that, but we have a lot of
anecdotal evidence and people in industry. We've talked to some
industry in Canada that have said that's not necessarily
cheaper or as difficult. So the requirements
are different. It's in the setup cost. So starting with
one, and it's not an option to gradually step
and move to the next one. That's a different
set of requirements. It's difficult to compare
the costs of GMP versus GPP because we haven't come across
anyone who has done both. So you can't say, well, actually
we manufactured this product under GMP, and this
is the product cost; or we manufactured this same
product [? under ?] GPP, and it was a lot less or more. So I just want to
reiterate that Canada has a medicines regime, which
is similar to our New Zealand regime-- manufacture to GMP and premarket
assessments of products. So the other thing that
we were looking at is, how long does it take to
get products to market? In Australia, they took 2 and
1/2 years from implementation to having the first
products come out. And I think they are only
a few manufacturers that are producing those products. We think we can do better. And we need your
help to do this. So this is really what
this is about, is saying, could we get products on
the market in less than 2 and 1/2 years at a high
quality and low cost? That's the challenge. Just moving onto the
product quality standards, the question that we have
asked in the consultation is, should these product
quality standards as set out in the appendix to the
consultation document-- should that apply to
starting material, active pharmaceutical
ingredients, or finished dose form products? We've proposed that there
be a quality standard set for the API that they must
meet the product specifications listed in that monograph. Part of GMP says
that it's important that you have quality active
pharmaceutical ingredients, because then you will be able
to manufacture your products to that specified quality. And that Product Quality
Standard Monograph that said alternative tests,
methods, or limits can be used, but they must be
scientific-justified. The monograph lists the product
specifications for the product, what you must meet,
the kinds and amounts of ingredients that are
allowed or not allowed, and defines the test, methods,
specifications, and limits, which are required to meet to
verify that your product meets those specifications. For the finished
product, we are proposing that the products must meet the
product specifications listed in the New Zealand Product
Quality Standards Monograph and the products must
also meet the dose form requirements and
requirements for stability, shelf life, packaging
and labeling, and quality of the
non-active ingredients. We're proposing that
certificates of analysis will provide evidence that
the product meets the quality standard. And those certificates
of analysis will have to be presented
to the regulator before these products can
be supplied into the market. But there'll be
more on that later [? in ?] the distribution. Now, the finished does
forms under the scheme, we're not proposing
to allow smoking. So we're proposing that
some of the higher risk dose forms, like the
modified-release dose forms and medicines
required to be sterile are only allowed if it's been
approved or provisionally approved by the Ministry. So they still come
under the scheme, but there needs a higher level
of risk assessment [? on top ?] [? of ?] these. Food containing
medicinal cannabis is not allowed
under the Food Act. And cannabis-based dietary
supplements, natural health products, and
nutraceuticals, because there is no regulation of that
and because cannabis as a prescription
medicine, [? or ?] CBD products are
prescription medicine, then they must meet the
requirements of the scheme. So they are all covered
under the scheme. So there are some
general requirements that are required for
all of the licenses. So we'll be wanting
details of the applicant and then details
of the premises, including geographical location. Because the licenses will be
issued to specific locations, we are, [? at ?] [? this, ?]
proposing that we would require applicants, directors,
partners in a partnership, and responsible persons to be
vetted under this legislation. And licenses can be
issued, as I said, before for a specific location. So we are not proposing
to put restrictions on locations with regard to, for
example, proximity to a school. So that won't be outlined
in the legislation, but just be aware that
it is at the discretion of the minister or
his delegate to decide on these applications. So if there are particular
issues associated with an application-- for example, an
applicant might try and set up or apply to set up
activities next to a school-- we would be aware of that. And we would look at that. And there might be requirements
to engage with your neighbors. But at the end of the
day, while we're not sort of putting hard
and fast rules on what is allowed and not
allowed, that's at the discretion of the
minister or his delegate. So these things can be decided
on a case-by-case basis. And if there are concerns
about the location or its proximity
to sensitive areas, then this can also be considered
on a case-by-case basis. So we're setting general
requirements out here. We will also be requiring
detailed security plans, because under the
international obligations, we have an obligation to
ensure that the cannabis is not diverted to illicit purposes. So the security plans will
cover physical security, operational and
procedural security, and personnel security,
which is around making sure that you have systems and
processes in place to employ suitable staff. We aren't proposing to put
such vetting restrictions on people you employ. That is your responsibility
as an employer to make sure that the people
that you employ are suitable. How you do that is up to you. So I'm moving on to licenses
to cultivate cannabis. What they will be
issued for a year. It's a new industry. We're seeking feedback on this. And we've also looked
at the Canadian approach and proposed that there be
small scale and large scale. But it's a nominal amount which
is based on Canada's operations and making that distinction. And we'd like some
feedback on whether that's set at the right level. We are also proposing
a difference between if you want to grow
high THC or low THC crops, and also requiring
crops to be separated. So if you have an
industrial hemp license and you want to grow cannabis
for industrial hemp purposes, then you can do that. If you then want to also
grow medicinal cannabis, you need a medicinal
cannabis license, but you need that to keep
the two crops separate. The purpose of the
cultivation is, you need to provide
us with details on the purpose of
the cultivation and the details of the
cultivation activity. So a few are growing to
supply to a manufacturer, or you are going to
carry out research-- the details of the
cultivation activity, for example, the cultivars and
cannabinoid profile, the area, or the number of plants
under cultivation. So we are required to
report that annually to our international
organization. The amendment in December
also made a provision to bring illicit New Zealand
seed into legitimate supply chain. So this is basically saying
that at the time that you apply or after you have
your license, you can declare an amount of seed
that you got from a New Zealand source and to bring that into
the legitimate supply chain. However, that
isn't the intention of this scheme to allow there
to be an ongoing illicit source. So we think that
it is worthwhile bringing that New Zealand
seed and New Zealand cultivars into the supply
chain, but if somebody wants to get into the
business of supplying you, then they will need
a license to do so. So that would be through
a declaration process. And we're seeking feedback on
how many times you can declare, how much you can declare-- all of those sorts of things. We have been asked
about the transition from cultivation for
research and the cultivation for commercial purposes. So there are a
number of companies that maybe have
applied or are seeking to apply for research
into breeding cultivars. And if they did come up
with a super cannabis plant, then we're not going
to say, sorry, you have to destroy that. The whole purpose of breeding
is to find a preferred cultivar with your preferred
characteristics. And you will be
allowed to transition an amount into the new system. However, that doesn't
allow you to start stockpiling all
your plants now so that once the regulations
come into place, you can just plant them
out and get a head start. It is to allow you to carry
through your breeding research into the commercial area,
but not in terms of stock. A number of people have
sort of asked whether or not we can just automatically
transfer a research license into a new commercial license. At the moment, we're saying
unlikely, because the research licenses are given
on the understanding that you've only got a
small number of plants and you want to be able
to get that research. And we have said that at
the end of that research, you will need to
destroy all your plants. Because the purpose
is not allowing you to breed all these plants
in anticipation of what might come out of the research. But as I said, we will
allow for the transition of a limited number of plants
to maintain your cultivar. We don't know what
the regulations are going to come out. So that new application
for commercial cultivation will need to be assessed
against these new requirements. So a license to manufacturer
medicinal cannabis products-- I talked before about the
standard GMP versus GPP. The licensed manufacturer
will include packaging as a manufacturing activity. But if we land on GMP as
a manufacturing standard, then the license to
manufacture will be issued under the Medicines Act. If we land on GPP for
some forms of cannabis, then that license to
manufacture will be issued under the Misuse of Drugs Act. CBD products-- because,
as Chris mentioned, they are prescription medicines
but not controlled drugs-- the license to
manufacture CBD products will be issued under
the Medicines Act. So the Medicines Act-- the supply license is a license
to sell medicines by wholesale under the Medicines Act. So again, for CBD
products, we are proposing that they must meet
the requirements of a finished product quality standard. So when we talk about
the supply chain, the Medicines Act proposals-- we already have a
pathway for consent or provisional consent for those
medicinal cannabis products. Those pathways
can still be used. So you can still apply
for your products to be fully consented or
provisionally consented under the act. And then just more on what all
that means in the next section. So for CBD products, there
will be a requirement for the finished product
to meet the quality standard as a minimum. Once that has been
verified, then the product can be added to
a license to sell your medicines by wholesale. And that will allow that product
to enter into the supply chain. As I mentioned before, approved
and provisionally approved medicinal cannabis products will
be also able to be applied for. For these products,
you will also need a license to deal under
the Misuse of Drugs Act because they are also
controlled drugs. The majority of products that
will be entering the supply chain will be unapproved, simply
because, as Chris mentioned, there won't be-- at least in the short-term-- that clinical data,
clinical trials that will talk about
safety and efficacy. So the license to supply
unapproved medicinal cannabis products under the
Misuse of Drugs Act-- so the non-CBD products--
in other words, the ones that have THC in them-- you need to provide
evidence, again, that the product meets the
requirements of the finished product quality standard. And once verified, the product
will be added to the license to supply. So, again, your
license to supply under the Misuse of
Drugs Act or your license to sell medicines by wholesale
will allow your products to enter the supply chain. But that needs to be verified
that it meets the product quality standards. For approved or provisionally
approved products, they don't require a separate
assessment against the finished product quality standard
because the finished product quality [? standard ?] will
be the minimum requirement. And there is a
separate assessment under these other schemes. A license to import or
export for non-CBD products, because they are
controlled drugs, need an import
and export license under the Misuse of Drugs Act. We are proposing to require
that imported and exported medicinal cannabis products must
meet the New Zealand quality standards as a minimum and that
it comprises the manufacturing quality standard and the
product quality standard. So a number of
industry players are interested in the export of
medicinal cannabis products. It makes sense, because
of economies of scale. And ultimately, that will
provide cheaper products that are available
in New Zealand if there are those economies
of scale in allowing export. So we are proposing to allow
export of unapproved products that meet the quality standards
and standardized, packaged, and labeled raw cannabis that
meets the quality standards. Being aware that if you apply
for an export license here, you also need to have an
import license to verify that they will take the product
from the importing country. Like other countries,
we are proposing to not allow the export
of unprocessed or bulk raw cannabis. So we'd be interested
in your views on that. Fees and charges. Our fees and charges section may
be a bit difficult to follow. So we're following the
treasury guidelines, which is basically full cost
recovery of the direct cost-- things like some of the
compliance activities and policy development. And the costs of those
aren't really included. So this is sort of based
on the hours and the effort that it has taken to
approve your application. So that includes the
assessments and the audits. The proposed fees are
calculated for two fees models for licenses to manufacture. So the first set of
fees is if we just had the GMP model of manufacture. And so all the licenses will
be issued under the Medicines Act for manufacture. And that is the first [? set. ?] If the second option is taken
where some products are allowed under GPP and some under
GMP, then the second model [INAUDIBLE] [? is ?]
the number of licenses that will be applied
for for manufacturing will be half GMP and half GPP. So the fees sit under
the Medicines Act. They're not changing
at this time. But some of you will be aware
that we are developing new legislation-- the
Therapeutic Products Bill-- which will eventually
replace the Medicines Act. And the Medicines Act fees may
be reviewed as part of that. They're just some years away. So, Chris, have you
had enough of a rest? And now we can hand you back
to talk about the prescribing requirements. OK. So I just want to take you
through the access parts and prescribing requirements. A little bit of
information about what ""approved,""
""provisionally approved,"" an ""unapproved"" means,
because that's really medicine terminology. And I just want you to
be aware of what that is. Go through what we're proposing
that doesn't change, and then some proposals for change. Obviously, this is why we're
coming out for consultation. So we are very keen
to get your thoughts on what we're
proposing to change and what we're
proposing not to change. So just some information to
start with around approvals. So effectively, you
have an approval which in the legislation
and Medicines Act is called ""consent."" We tend to use ""approval""
because no one really knows what ""consent"" means. But effectively,
you get approval to distribute a medicine. And this is where
there's evidence supporting the efficacy,
safety, and the quality of the products. And this evidence is assessed
by Medsafe and the Ministry. And then a consent is given by
the minister in the Medicines Act, or a delegate. So that's the approval. A provisional
approval is a clause in the legislation
that allows us to give an early approval or
a provision or an approval with conditions to distribute a
medicine on a restricted basis. And it's based on clinical
need and potentially on a limited number of patients. Now, we use this in a number
of ways in the Medicines Act to do things like put
conditions on medicines. So there's a medicine
used in mental health, for instance, that
is very effective, but also can have
serious side effects as far as effects it can
have on your blood cells. So we use a provisional
consent pathway to say, this can be approved, but you
must have a white blood cell monitoring system in place. This provisional
consent has also been used in the past for early
access to antiretrovirals. So decades ago when the
clinical data was quite limited and was developing,
the clinical need meant that these products
needed to be approved. And so they were. And what it meant was,
you can give an approval while the clinical
studies were continuing. And then there's
unapproved products, where the safety and
efficacy and quality has not been assessed
by the Ministry. So happy to answer
questions if there's any further
clarification needed. But that's really
the key parts to it. So firstly, on what we're
not looking at changing. So CBD products-- no change,
other than, obviously, them coming out of the
Misuse of Drugs Act. [? They're ?]
[? around ?] access. So there's a definition. CBD products-- medicinal
cannabis products that contain less than
2% of the cannabinoid THC or other controlled drugs
or psychoactive substances. So we have had some
feedback on that definition. I'm keen to get feedback
on that definition, as well, through your
consultation process. And please send that through. So no changes proposed for
approved or provisionally approved CBD products
that can be prescribed by a medical practitioner
or a nurse practitioner, for instance. Unapproved CBD
products could only be prescribed by a
medical practitioner. And this is because
the Medicines Act has that terminology in it. The Medicines Act is 1981. As Andrea said, we
have just consulted on getting that
legislation updated. But there is probably
a couple of years away. So that's the key difference
there between approved CBD products and unapproved
CBD products. Now, talking about CBD, they
are prescription medicines that are scheduled in
the Medicines Act now. They have to be prescribed. The way to change that
access in the Medicines Act is to look at a
classification change. And that's something
that I imagine industry would be very interested in. And what we do is look
at an application, for instance, on the safety and
access balance for a product, for a substance such
as CBD, and then get some expert advice on that. So I guess the key
way to describe it is, is this
product sufficiently safe that a patient can go
in and self-diagnose and self-select? Or should they really be having
a conversation with a health care professional? Is that a pharmacist, so that
you can have it in a pharmacy and sell in a pharmacy? Is it a pharmacist
where you have to have a
consultation, where you have to go and talk
to the pharmacist before you get it
from the pharmacy? Or should you be going to see a
medical practitioner or a nurse practitioner and
get a prescription? Or a pharmacist practitioner,
prescriber, as well. So there is a way that
CBD can be looked at, as far as access goes. We know that it has wider
access in other countries. We've talked to
industry representatives about that process
and how you can have a look at
where the CBD should be widened in terms of access. Unapproved medicinal
cannabis products, that's the other part
of the prescribing change we looked at. We're not looking
at changes where unapproved products that do
not meet the quality standards. This is for unapproved
medicinal cannabis products they aren't CBD products. We're looking at
no changes there where a specialist can
continue to prescribe those with Ministry approval. And what typically
happens is information comes to the Ministry about
the quality of the product and some clinical information,
and our chief medical officer has a look at the
clinical information. We look at the
quality information and help provide
some advice back to the prescriber
about that product to help them make the
decisions for the patients. So it's really for
informed consent, but also so prescribers know
what they are prescribing if it's an unapproved product. Now, onto the new proposals. There's approved products-- so
non-CBD products are approved products, such as we
currently have the moment, is [INAUDIBLE]. But that may grow in the future. Now, on-label use-- and
what I mean by ""on-label"" and ""off-label"" is [INAUDIBLE]
is approved for treatment of spasticity in
multiple sclerosis. And that's through
clinical trial data that they've sent through. And [? an ?] approval
was [? administered. ?] That's what's termed
as ""on-label."" Use of [INAUDIBLE] for anything
else is called ""off-label."" So it can be
prescribed, but that's the difference between the two. So the proposal was
for on-label use that these products
can be prescribed by medical practitioners. And currently they have to be
recommended by a specialist. We propose removing that. For off-label use, they
can also be prescribed by medical practitioners. They will need endorsement by
a specialist or recommendation by a specialist, but [? we'll ?]
remove any requirement to have to send these through
the Ministry of Health. So at the moment,
any prescribing of [INAUDIBLE] for
off-label use, for instance, has to come through
the Ministry of Health. We'd propose removing that. Now, for unapproved products
that meet the quality standards, we're
proposing that they be prescribed by specialists
and also remove the requirement for Ministry approval. Also, adding a provision
for medical practitioners to prescribe with
specialists' recommendation. So what we're looking at here
is a balance between access and looking at barriers
to access for patients with who should be
prescribing these and what sort of
specialty do you need. This is obviously a key
question that we have for-- well, for all groups. Obviously, health
professionals are going to provide us with quite
a lot of feedback, as well. We're really interested
in what industry thinks about this, too. Should all of
these products just be open and be able
to be prescribed by any medical practitioner
or authorized prescriber? Should you require specialists? Should you not? What sort of specialists? We're really keen to get
feedback on this, as well as, obviously, the rest of it. Now, the consultation
period, just to close off, running for four weeks
from the 7th of August. We typically try to run
these for a bit longer, but I've talked to you about why
we've had to condense this down to four weeks. We're running information
sessions obviously here in Auckland. We're also running sessions in
Wellington and Christchurch. We're talking to
industry groups. We're talking to medical
professionals and consumer groups so we can get
everyone's views. Obviously, as
probably no surprise, there are quite diverse views
on these products around access and around quality. Our expert advisory group, the
Medicinal Cannabis Advisory Group, will be meeting
early September to look at reviewing the
regulatory proposals-- so looking at all the
consultation information, looking at the
key themes, seeing which proposals
would go forward, and which proposals
should change. And that's why your submissions
are really important here. We're then looking at
[? cabinet ?] approval for draft regulations
in October, and then approval of the
regulations in December. Thanks very much
for your attention."
ZZ6ptup5Jlk,Grandparents illegally growing cannabis to save granddaughter with epilepsy | 60 Minutes Australia,2019-12-04T08:00:04Z,[Music] this paddock full of cannabis lies in the Hunter Valley north of Sydney at first glance it appears an odd place to spend time with your granddaughter but what brought Barry Lambert one of Australia's most successful businessman and his wife joy here is sheer desperation the fight to save four-year-old Kaitlyn how does cannabis help Kaitlyn from the first day she improved she got clear in the mind she wanted to do more he's more active and she was happier and that is basically what happens to every child does cannabis stop the seizures yeah she was been hospitalized Phylis Asia for about ten months or so do you reckon this really works it really works [Music] now Barry and joy who until very recently had never even seen cannabis a financing a medical revolution in Australia there's a little factory that makes your medicine they've invested in this commercial cannabis farm and donated thirty four million dollars to unlock the scientific secrets of the plant and it's not just helping Caitlyn is that this is potentially helping thousands oh absolutely not just for kindnesses for a whole range of various conditions where's it gone and that's what the research is about is to prove that medically said that the doctors will be convinced do you feel like trailblazers no we just do what's right yeah what do you think of your father's generosity well that's big bears it's Barry he doesn't drive fancy cars he just he does the right thing it's philanthropy born from pain Caitlin's pain from the age of six months this beautiful baby started having uncontrollable seizures her father Michael was powerless to stop them you know when it's happening you can hear it from the other side of the room here we go it's pretty hard to take harder for her because all that electricity racing through your brain if she does damage and how long has her longest seizure being doing her house now the longest one started in in the emergency department and the rainbow doctors couldn't stop it Oh Indian and she was still seizing but one of the nurses was crying so that really told me something because when children have long seizures there's a lot of damage Caitlin was eventually diagnosed with a rare and catastrophic form of epilepsy called dravet syndrome each seizure causes brain damage and can be fatal under conventional treatment these kids don't have a long life expectancy because they often died during a seizure sometime one in six fearing time was running out for Caitlin they did their own online research and discovered cannabis was a potential treatment for epilepsy let's face it out and I usually just put her on a chip so Michael started importing this cannabis paste from Denmark and the impact was startling radical reduction in the number of seizures when we gave it to her I just said to my wife holy smokes it works you could just say instead of all this noise in her head it was just clear and instead of jerking it dribbling this she just walked out it was nothing wrong with her what game you playing there poppy is the stuff you're giving Katelyn making her high no it clears her might it's making her less drowsy less confused but it's cannabis it's marijuana and marijuana makes you high it doesn't roll cannabis is not psychoactive it doesn't make you high right knee down the street but there was one major problem giving this cannabis medicine to Caitlyn was illegal the Lambert's were forced to become law breakers in their bid to save her we couldn't wait every day we waited there were seizures and she'd have to be in hospital and then you come out and is that any way for a family to live just people live it every day so how disparate were you desperate enough to stick my neck out I taught at 67 which I was then they can't do anything to me what can they do to me they could put me in jail but that doesn't matter change me to truly understand the Lambert's resolve you have to appreciate where they have come from Barry grew up on a dairy farm in Terry on the mid-north coast of New South Wales mother diagnose tendon liver the old man one of how many kids one of the five boys I was saying younger so you had to be fairly tough with them playing a lot of sport and cricket and all that sort of stuff you wouldn't while still at school he made a feisty redhead joy Cole so what did you think when you first met Barry just a stunner I'm sorry I knew exactly what did you think well obviously I thought it was a very sexy man really sexy legs I used to write little notes and put him with his lunch Barry and joy married 50 years ago and children soon followed but then tragedy their second daughter Nadine died when she was two and a half from a rare brain swelling condition called hydrocephalus a long time ago but do those memories come flooding back they do all the time but it was 40 odd years ago so you sort of it's not as fast yesterday hmm they soften but they don't go away is the best way I can describe it dearly kills you but you don't die even if you feel you want to and having already lost a child we we know what's possible you try and save your children with something wrong but when you've got that thought in your head and I didn't want Mike to go through what our zeldo went through he's can be quite an emotional person which is good he'd have a cry and they'll say it's okay darlin it's good to cry I'm gonna have to go on the court but does that sound fun yeah she's a happy beautiful little girl but there are obviously problems there yes there's uh according to the doctor she she's definitely [ __ ] and a whole range of problems but as parents it's hard to accept we could see the damage but we also know that she's got a growing brain she's got a hope she's got a future and if we can stop the seizures we can give her that future a future to grow brain and and she'll never be the smartest kid in the class but if she can walk and talk she'll be doing well something positive had to come out of all this pain and we're very sold his business Network count financial to the Commonwealth Bank he became a very wealthy man but then the Lambert's did something truly remarkable donating 34 million dollars to cannabis research here at Sydney University it's one of the largest donations to medical science in Australia's history you didn't think twice about donating thirty four million dollars to medical cannabis research was only 33.7 by the way 33.7 oh just to be accurate yeah embarrassing really it's the recognition it's got I think really hmm yeah no it's it's you know if you can afford it why not like you can't take it with you people like Barry don't come along every day do they well no it's it's quite transformational in terms of my life I'm scientists in Australia we tend to scratch around from one grant to the next you know we managed to get research done somehow you're expected to win a Nobel Prize with you know a tin can in a matchbox [Music] Professor Ian McGregor runs the Lambert initiative so all the work that I'm seeing taking place here today is thanks to Barry it is yes I mean we and this is just a small amount of the work that's going on in the Lambert initiative this is our chemistry lab with this money some of the best young scientists are now studying the various molecules of cannabis called cannabinoids which could literally save young lives like Caitlin's and many others as well somewhere in there you may have a very important anti-cancer drug you may have something that's marvelous for dementia or schizophrenia or anxiety or Parkinson's disease we firmly believe that there's a great treasure trove of future therapeutics amongst the cannabinoids in this right here right here the well the scientists embarked on this groundbreaking cannabis research Michael Lambert can't wait he's convinced little Caitlyn is living proof of its medicinal value it's an amazing plant it's given us amazing hope that there is a future for Caitlyn and should we still take the other drugs and we're not going to throw away the medicine altogether we're gonna keep taking the other drugs and we're going to keep listening to the doctors and to ensure a steady supply of this medicine Michael started cultivating his own cannabis knowing he was breaking the law he informed doctors police and even sent a crop sample to New South Wales Parliament House but this transparency only landed him in hot water last year he was arrested and charged with cultivation and possession of the drug now I love my Caitlyn and any law that says that I have to watch her die and not look after her is a stupid law needs to be changed so what you're doing for Caitlyn it's worth having a criminal record for oh absolutely I'm not going to no record I'm gonna win come on chickens medical-necessity right you can't make a father watch his daughter die where's the chick inside morally yes got the high ground here but legally you're breaking the law I know he's an ass that sons breaking a little yeah we just give him support yeah how do you feel about that uh well you've always gotta rock the boat a little bit in life I think these charges are still before the courts but the Lambert family is confident of a legal victory and a medical one as well she doesn't know it yet but little Kaitlin may change the way Australia and the rest of the world looks at cannabis what do you think Barry's legacy will be I would like to think that at the end of this process we'll have two maybe three new cannabinoid drugs on the market I'd like to think that one of them will be for pediatric epilepsy we'll call it Caitlyn's drug but I'd really like to have one for pain and I'd really like to have one for dementia as well it's all working for you that planet and everybody else [Music] hello I'm Allison Langdon

NGSNydk4ctI,A mother&#39;s fight for medicinal cannabis | A Current Affair,2019-08-21T01:30:01Z,our parents will do almost anything to ease a child's pain some will even risk jail that's all you want as a mum is for your child to be happy and healthy maybe you can be responsible for saving somebody's life I could be a superhero that's correct I've gone from being mum to being doctor to being pharmacist and I'm also a criminal for doing that Lynne cleaver says she has no other choice but to break the law anywhere within Australia what that little bottle cuz when I send you out despite the fact regulated medicinal cannabis is now legal in our country red tape and bureaucratic nonsense means this mum is forced to grow her own so she can treat her severely disabled adult son Jeremy as his mother I find it incredibly offensive that a bureaucrat or a politicians should choose to stand between him and his doctor and his quality of life Lynne can't stand the stuff herself but claims the oil in this bottle is helping make her son's life so much better it's the first medicine we've been able to give Jeremy that comes side-effect free and that's incredible come in and I'll introduce it's in my little star Oh get a shall we hey it's raid can i raid the bureaucrats have also denied Danny Oh laterals son shall be access to a prescription for medicinal cannabis at the moment my hands are tied EV medicine New South Wales mum Kate Bevan is one of the lucky ones she was able to get a prescription for her daughter Evelyn but now faces financial devastation to pay for it I personally can't afford that without sort of selling my house if you speak to the state they say it's the common if you speak to the Commonwealth they say it's the state and in the middle are the poor parents desperately trying to keep their children alive the crazy thing is the first crop of legal government grown cannabis was harvested more than a year ago and it's likely plenty more have been cultivated since then but still so many desperate families can't get their hands on the product so it's got us wondering where's the weed that's the million-dollar question isn't it when you've seen just recently the government bolstering industry to be able to export this medicine when there's only a few thousand people in Australia that have a legal prescription we've gone through clobbers am I was polite as a runt in lamotrigine that's just a few of the different ones that we've had but none of those pharmaceutical drugs have helped Kate's twelve-year-old Evelyn who leaves with a rare type of epilepsy when she's in the middle of a seizure and you're watching your baby girl go from pink to blue and then a scary one when she goes gray and knowing that there's nothing you can do it is absolutely heartbreaking in April last year Evelyn was prescribed medicinal cannabis through the Therapeutic Goods administration's special access scheme the regulated product does not contain the psychoactive component of the cannabis plant known as THC my little darling who really struggled with to learn new concepts with math was able to come home and smash through her math homework the improvement was unbelievable she went from the bottom to percentile for IQ through to the I think was about the 47th percentile and that was just in nine months on the medication but the Newcastle mum has been forced to rely on her family to help pay for the privilege of her daughter's happiness it costs k2 staggering four hundred and fifty dollars a week for the medicine that's more than twenty three thousand dollars a year in many cases even if patients are successful in their bid for a prescription they often can't afford it according to melbourne pharmacist jared makhmour most of the time people are coming with a prescription already we will then advise them about the price and in most instances at that point people are like okay thank you but we'll look into something else it's almost impossible leader of the reason party fiona pattern it's actually a schedule for product which is similar to a a penicillin or an antibiotic Jamie comes here Monday through Friday and then on a Saturday sometimes if he's well enough Launceston mum leans multiple applications to the tasmanian government's medicinal cannabis controlled access scheme have been rejected that's why she grows her own cannabis and uses oil from the plants to successfully treat her 28 year old son Jeremy helping prevent severe and painful seizures linked to his epilepsy unlike the regulated product Kate uses Lin's medicine does contain THC it smells like cannabis does Jeremy get stoned when you give this to him you know because Jeremy's on a really good well balanced strains of cannabis Daniel also grows her own plants to treat her 11 year old she'll be almost no seizures now those products are technically not legal so it could be have contaminants we don't know those things Paul Benham is chief innovation officer at Alexson all global Australia's biggest cannabis company hundreds of people have contacted Alex nor asking when its products will be available and we have to reply when the government allows us to the company already produces hemp and is ready and willing to help grow tons of medicinal cannabis for the Australian public but is still waiting for its cultivation license it applied for two years ago originally they had indicated it would take about 21 days we've already had an issue with Evelyn supply where we weren't able to access it for three weeks and I've never been so nervous in my life the government insists the current system is working telling ACA there has been a significant increase in successful applications under the special access scheme with more than 2200 approved in July this year we know how safe it is and how well it can work the government's full response is on our homepage you
l_-9vuvtBpU,Perth Western Australia Is Now Medically Legal,2019-07-28T02:00:02Z,
kIOg5_ZpCWA,"PHARMAC seminar: Medicinal cannabinoids, 4. Medicinal cannabis, moving the debate forward",2019-04-08T05:40:02Z,"welcome to all and so it's Bruce's seeds my name's Charles Newton house I think it's really important we knew our country listened to people to think that they tell you a little bit about who they are now what they do in why they're here and the reason I think that it's important is because like it or not we're biased and what we do know and if we ignore the fact with bias we're probably missing one of the most important reasons why we're doing most of the stuff they're doing and I might be a psychiatrist which is why I think that in and of itself as a balance I suppose so this psyches graphically represents the bits of mirror or a patient for this in large part so if Brutus says I'm a consultants car interest but in my medical training here at the University of Otago in a Manuel Antonio so kind of Maya socio-cultural education is one of a born of breed New Zealand er and I did my Sequoia tree training at Imperial College in London so as part of that about half of that was spent doing addiction psychiatry so I spent a lot of time seeing a lot of people who have had a lot of problems with psychoactive substances I'm not a GP seeing patients with people you see in a trickle ball pain a lot I've seen a lot of people have had a lot of problems really big problems and I guess in this context it's of relevance because all about today is about prescribing and I completely agree with ground here drugs that change the way your brain works and how you perceive and understand the world and those sorts of drugs carry with them inherent risks and both from an evidence and experience perspective and so I think you're gonna hear some of what I talk about I guess it's because of their clinical anecdotal experience experience I've had I'm a sochi project at the University of Otago and I also think that's important because it means I'm a bit of a geek I spend a lot of time reading papers I've been sitting at the back of the room trying to sort out a conference in is one of my colleagues said to me the other day Giles just need to get out of your head and so I do put a lot of weight on the evidence I do think that is one of the key differences in terms are health professionals between medical practitioners in other health professionals or people who are trying to help other people so an awful lot of people make their livings do their jobs and in general a lot of personal well-being ahead of helping other people and I guess one of the things which is not quite unique but of particular importance in medicine is that we try and blend out in science so I'm kind of interested in the science a bit I have some cannabis affiliation so both the NCRC which is a local New Zealand are chemists sort iam in in one of the international advisors to acre which is the Australian cannabis consortium both organizations of whichever gives an advocacy role from seed to problems and try to assist governments federal state in here in New Zealand to think about and what they're doing in terms of cannabis change and with your like it or not that's coming you know the way society sees cannabis is different now and Ozma's occurred in that change will continue and continue to accelerate I'm also a member of P Tech which is the pharmaceutical and therapeutics Advisory Committee for farm ik so I have a very positive view of farm akin what farm it does for New Zealand I think if I look of all of the roles that I do I actually wonder if it's the role and p-tech that delivers the most good for all of New Zealanders for all there's not being able to prescribe whatever you like for free for your patients and sometimes very frustrating for many doctors and I will clinically a half time I'm an academic and half time clinical so seeing patients advising largely and other consultant colleagues and in mental health so when I think about cannabinoids I'm thinking about them with these various personal pressures I mean that's where I'm coming at this from so it doesn't take a genius to know that cannabis cannabinoids medical cannabis are part of our society a really integral part of our society so depending on exactly who you believe we're in the top two or three and at the very worst five users of cannabis in the world so after tobacco into nicotine canvas is the third most used psychoactive substance curiously it's very difficult to see how much happiness to them to all about so there's an awful lot of cannabis around and there's an awful lot of cannabis around in New Zealand and that's important to both because a lot of patients that you will be seeing will be smoking cannabis regularly and my grandma said if you don't ask them they won't tell you there will also be a not inconsiderable considerable number of you guys in here who smoke cannabis for either a purported medical or recreational users and so cannabis is a kind of an ingrained part of our culture and who we are you'll have personal views about it either because you use cannabis or you have used cannabis or your kids use cannabis and trying to figure out what to do about that and so most of us will have some kind of experience and we just need to bear that in mind when we think about this and I guess the other thing which is really important for us to bear in mind as medical practitioners is that there is a very strong Lobby that drives the very positive views of cannabis as a social good so you know some of these pictures are up here you know your kids won't know who I am but they will know who's Snoop Dogg is you know and so what they see are lots of very positive celebrity images of people who advocate for in smoked cannabis and say how wonderful it is were thinking about all other potential risks and like it or not is we condone cannabis and cannabinoids we are in some ways condoning their culture and so some stuff is starting to be written by sociologists about the relative risk of their so kind of understanding how various medicines and or dried whole plant extracts may work it's really important for your practice but actually what you do how you talk to your patients and what ends up happening is going to be influenced by the social society the pressures that are you're in and I put on you by your patients in by society in general and are going to be reflected on what society does so to give you an example the cannabis market in the u.s. last year was with 202 million US dollars they estimate this year the cannabis market in the US will be worth slightly in excess of two billion US dollars it depends exactly on who you read but cannabis is one of the top three and often the top fastest growing industry globally so people realize that this is a mess of the growing industry and it's without question the fastest employer of people in the state at the moment so this is an area where there is a huge amount of interest the companies who are most interested in seeing the development of cannabis in cannabinoid products are not big pharma the big food in big and drink companies so the companies are investing most heavily in cannabis and cannabinoid products wrapped up however you like there's not being driven from medicine or Pharma and although you may not think that of this as being particularly relevant when you prescribe CBD each one of your patients you have a discussion about cannabis this tells us something about the social drives and how globally certainly large capitalism views cannabis and my inference from that and it's an inference is because what they see is a decriminalized cannabis market and they see very large profit on that and you're probably not wrong and so they are some some things to kind of bear in mind so if we think about cannabis and cannabinoid products from a medical perspective I guess so cannabis has been a drug that doctors have prescribed for the benefits of their patients for a long time so you know I think 5000 years is about as far back as you'll see written about or noted in the literature from a kind of a Western perspective at least 3,000 years and from a gives a modern Western perspective it was brought back from India is essentially probably a 1 to 1 and THC CBD product in about 1800s was rapidly picked up across a wide sector of society so this was used both as of to nature in dried product boats from kind of paupers right up to Queen Victoria whose physician advocated for it very strongly it rapidly made its way into the u.s. pharmacopoeia in so it's been used and widely use for a variety of miracle additions for a long time until in the mid 20th century slightly different in different places that became criminalized really in again a few too much fun for me about their criminalization or decriminalization of it but from a medical perspective essentially what they did was prevented us really understanding australian of kind of a modern western medical sense so that has been a very major impediment towards really getting our heads around how this might be useful in a modern medical sense in terms of treatment and there continues to be the case if you're interested in some of the sociological backstory about why we think cannabis might have got criminalized and the changes about that I recommend you watch a movie called reef and the adness how much is narrated by Woody Harrelson it's both funny and very factually accurate it's got it's got nothing to do with medicine at all in certain to what we see now I guess is this real urgent of an understanding that cannabis in its various constituents might have real medical utility in his grams already talked to you about very clearly for some people it does you know I think that is an undeniable fact so I guess I was reading these slides late last night a kind of when I was reading about I thought about it I thought kind of feel about like I might be the edge of teaching all the suck inks which kind of wasn't really the purpose it's more that these a bunch of things that we take for granted when we practice I mean are seeing patients and are doing some stuff and particularly when it comes to prescribing of tablets and these are things that we take for granted but our patients take for granted - these are the kind of assumptions and the unwritten rules around what we do just like when I go and see my GP there's an unwritten rule that I am patient and she is the doctor and she's gonna I'm gonna tell her my symptoms and she's going to tell me what to do about it now that's that's the rule it's about my illness behavior in the sick role and that a patient's supposed to be in there very often when patients don't fulfill this sick roles and when doctors don't fulfill their medical role and you wind up seeing me as a psychiatrist so I work mostly in a personality disorder moment so you know those roles are important but when it comes to prescribing and medicine what it means is these sorts of things other things that patients have speaked in a kind of an unwritten societal contract and we don't think about it very often and in part because we don't have time apart because we don't need to especially here in New Zealand and the reason that we don't need to is because we've got really good government regulatory authorities that do this for us as they should in mid safe has been installed as one of the best regulatory authorities in the world for the management of medicines in pharma has been extolled as one of the best public health drug buyers globally or so so actually didn't newzealand we're blessed because we've got some some really good systems that work for us so when we see our patients and we're thinking about prescribing we don't need to do that stuff and obviously in this particular space this is important because what we're not doing is engaging these kind of bits of our national system and thinking around the prescribing of cannabis or cannabinoids at least not at the moment unless you happen to be prescribing sativex for spasticity as groaners already seed and it has gone through mid safe and since I've proved I mean outside of that just you know and I think something for you to ponder is to ask the self the question why has that not occurred so what is that that is probably preventing pharmaceutical companies from simply registering the cannabis products you know and it's that's something that's worth bearing in mind when you think what you're doing when it comes to prescribing so something I particularly liked about our grams talk and something I think is really really important when we think about this too is exactly what we're talking about so you'll see from what the mid say presentation earlier this morning when they talk about cannabis they're talking about anything that's come from a cannabis plant but actually there are a whole lot of cannabinoids you can make synthetic cannabinoids it's not that difficult it's pretty easy to do in the lab and you can make a whole bunch of derivatives from this that again a bunch of your patients will be taking off the streets and synthetic cannabinoids can be either molecules that essentially look exactly the same as the molecules you might suck out of apply all there are those molecules that they've been tinkin words they add stuff to they break the benzene rings apart you know in playing with cannabinoids that will get a compound itself it's not very difficult to do so it's real easy for a chemist and a lab to mess around like cooking with a cannabinoid product to produce a synthetic cannabinoid so when you're thinking about cannabis in the prescription of cannabis and really importantly at least in my mind when you're thinking about the advice you're giving to your patients around cannabis you can I'm annoyed is thinking about what am I actually talking about okay so as an addiction psychiatrist the usual patter I would have for people so I whipped and why are after six years the patter would go something like just smoke Doug bro and the arts would be no and I'd be like what about on a Friday after your box at 10:00 ease with your bros and I'd be like maybe if someone bought it and I'd be like so would there be three or five times a week no I wouldn't be five dawg so you only smoke the weekend sort of Thursday at Monday yeah it's about right and maybe once or twice in the morning before I go to work so do you buy by the ounce of the pound and you'll need to start learning in how much is an ounce of weed that's a lot how much as a pound of weed is ridiculous and they'll be like don't be crazy in I only ever buy half an ounce month it's so something like that would be a standard conversation right into trying to work that out or if they buy from at any house if they were regulars play those things are kind of important could you can get some inference about what they're smoking well they know about what they're taking what difference it makes and so when you know one of the advantages I have is time one of the advantages you don't have any see patients as that but if people are coming to you and asking for advice about cannabis or cannabinoids if it's not stuff you're prescribing and it's not in a bottle well you know what it is you can get onto increasingly shaky ground pretty quickly because it's very difficult to know what you're actually providing advice about and and I think that's something that we hear about a little bit in the literature and the kind of editorials and comment rescissions of some of the journals I read but it's something that we can slip into thinking about without really thinking about it and so that's not to say that some of what you hear today is an absolutely bang on the mark and technically accurate but it is important to bear in mind that we should be talking about it drugs as we know what it is you know the doses of what we're using we know what science there is behind it and what lack of science there is behind it and as I remember the good professor Fergusson saying once he ran the Christchurch health and development study multiple anecdotes don't equal evidence and so multiple anecdotes are important but they're not evidence in if there is an important difference to bear in mind so the stuff down the bar oh good no problem the stuff at the top not us if we can know a little bit about how this works how this interaction between society cannabis in medicine doctors in my signal cannabis whatever that means works because we've done some research on it so pleasure and his colleagues took a look in the New Zealand drug survey back in 2013 who uses Kenneth's right and this is what they found so the people who tended to use these cannabis Masuda links they just asked you to use cannabis do you use it as a medicine so they're basically male younger least we educated in relatively poor so I guess when I had anxiety about the increasingly socially acceptable use cannabis as a medicine it is not about treating the three-year-old with dravet syndrome which Lindsay one of the pediatricians he was involved in what I see as being the first really high-quality groundbreaking randomized control trial that shows the benefit by reduction and caesars seizures in improvement and functioning of CBD for a particular type of dravet syndrome you know so it's a pretty rare childhood epilepsy and I'm not thinking about you know the person who's got whatever horrible disease they have which you're pretty confident they're gonna be dead in the next four weeks from I'm thinking about Joe average Kiwi and when I think about the way the law is written and what constitutes requiring palliation I'm also worries because sometimes I feel like I need a bit of palliation yeah particularly if the kids are being read based so it is worrying when we know that the sorts of people who are going to come and ask you for this the sorts of people are go to want cannabis and who will perceive themselves as using at a medicine and they're now you so thirties they're talking about here at least we'll educate a relatively poor and the sorts of things that they'll come and ask you for them are these sorts of things so pain and we put a little bit of our pain and I'm going to hear a little bit more about pain there is these are pay men which so I haven't bothered circle in there but importantly they also would say that they need it for this stuff here anxiety nerves and depression and that end either the third one after psychiatric uses asleep interestingly but we know some stuff about cannabis so smoked cannabis THC CBD products in most mental illnesses can long story short the more of us the science the better it is for you however you want to wrap it up now it's not the same as CBD only products so um the evidence is weak Porter not totally non-existent when it comes to mental illnesses in CBD only products but I think there is a signal that in a decade we're gonna have pretty good evidence that there will be some value for some specific disorders at some clear doses probably very significantly higher than grains talk to you about in terms of prescribing but we're certainly we're in a kind of preclinical trial stage at the moment and so the stuffs kind of important so you're going to young poorly educated guys come into your saying only cannabis for my anxiety please doc that that's what they're going to come and ask for at least that's what the evidence here from New Zealand tells us and this is exactly the sort of person whom I suspect prescribing in the signal cannabis whatever you mean by there was exactly not the right patient to be prescribing for so one other thing I haven't got here at this date it's very clear mostly from cross-sectional research that's been done in a mirror places like Colorado if you asked about preferred methods of use and again I'm not talking here about your three-year-old with epilepsy or your person of the month of death is smoking followed by eating so they're the two the two most preferred users and they are their users that are most commonly in people who take THC containing products that best mechanisms for intoxication and so you know it's very clear from what Graham said that kind of understand and why people are taking it how they perceive this I mean Ruta modality is important and we're right at the very beginning stages of us in New Zealand but if we look at some places with medical cannabis has been around much longer there's certainly an indication that that's the way it's going and if you think about who's investing in cannabis and who's developing these products I can promise you that the only medicine Graham will have ever tried as a gummy bear of cannabinoids could you don't go to your pharmacy and get and you get gummy beer paracetamol although you can't get little fish oil fish as I suppose and so there's some stuff to think about very briefly I get to see the hands from cannabis in my addictions medicine role and in my general psychiatry on call wrong in those harms are pretty clear from a psychiatry perspective both in terms of acute intoxication are aimed at terms of more chronic use and they tend to be around the worsening of anxiety and depression in really importantly the development of psychotic mental disorders I think they are really importantly if you were an adolescent so 16 to 25 there are two very large long-term cohort studies one of which is here done here in New Zealanders that show us it increases your risk of schizophrenia four to twenty fold it's when I started training I guess the we were still weren't sure is I'm pretty confident now that if you smoke in those important adopted up parts of your brain development you'll really significantly increase your risk of very chronic misperception of the world in understanding what's going on if we kind of wrap up as being misdiagnosis of schizophrenia in there's a bunch of other other research around us the latest article I read was a large study that they've done in Sweden where they can do these awesome linkage in studies and they were looking for this so they were looking for a link between cannabis and in this case lying hits a 65 patient years couldn't find one name interestingly the biggest weakness in this study is the only way they have a measure of cannabis is self which they note as a mass of weakness and potentially makes the study fatally flawed but we haven't found this will lengths as grams mentioned that we have before which isn't that isn't without very significant problems in terms of the development of cannabis use disorder so alcohol and drug use disorders probably the best study published in JAMA or a few years ago we have a nice natural state-by-state experiment in Americas there were 23 states where there was legislation allowing the prescription of cannabis and cannabinoids either medically or recreationally we're didn't and essentially what they're able to show was a three-fold increase and up to team seen of people in states with it was you were allowed to use cannabis and cannabis use disorders computer states where you would and it's pretty clear here that these seems to be this correlation is correlation causal definitely not but it is something important to notice and there's no reason to think that things won't be the same here in New Zealand so bearing in mind we can't see the people we need to see now and addiction services it doesn't make me anxious about what that means in terms of need for services for people who are using them as news go on so I lift this out initially but I thought I'd add it because it's one of next good papers and so this is a study from Australia done by Nick in Wayne Hall and others so this is a large cohort and it's doing a lot he's a great ceccacci excellent researcher doing a lot of research looking at cannabis and cannabis based products when I quite like what happened in my last in Sydney he he in his indomitable style he's an amazing extrovert isn't he came to sit down and got a companies like jobs I've got a kilo and a half of chaos at home and I don't have a I don't have my cannabis safe at home it's at the lab I'm like what are you doing here go get that and get it to the office so is one of these problems you have when you've got a license to hit canvas so they followed up howl at people with chronic opioid pain and what they wanted to know is if these people used chemists did it improve them without better this is one of the claims that has been Mabel the opioid crisis is a major problem of people to smoke dope though useless opioids and not be better and it's got good face validity you kind of make sense right but actually when you do this in a robust current way that doesn't happen so they found that there was no evidence that cannabis improved patient outcomes and actually it probably did them harm it's now it's in this paper in your your direction so it's an again this is not CBD products there's people who are just you know using cannabis so self-reported use of cannabis almost certainly smoked almost certainly drive for all whole drug product you know pulled the plants out of the ground dry them roll them up and smoked them the people who are smoking cannabis regularly clearly did worse and I guess they're kind of the last thing I want to say is that there's something about us which is important to remember as we come into these consultations we're just talking about this at lunch you know and I see someone what I really want to do is something good for this person in front of it so for me because I'm a bit of a geek what that means is doing something that's really clearly evidence-based if I possibly can but that's also quite difficult because the evidence in terms of effective long term interventions for people with personality disorder is terrible so I'm constantly working with the fact that there's a bunch of ambivalence about treatment and there the evidence I have to base what I'm doing on as a limited and about trying to work around how we can do the best with what we have so I'd be lying to you if I said my my clinical practice was evidence-based no my clinical practice as much as I hate to admit it as even its informed because that's the best I have and I think it's a place we are at at the moment when we think about that prescribing of cannabis at Beast we can argue the evidence base for what we do is evidence informed rather than evidence-based although there is a growing number of studies which will help us move from this position of information to being more evidence-based in what we do in some of that evidence is positive but an awful lot of the evidence is negative - and we need to be balancing those things together and I guess the other thing to kind of bear in mind and I'm not a GP and I don't run a full-service practice you know I didn't get paid more if the more or fewer people I see and I'm very happy for you and all berate me and if I Madeline I want to know abut what the evidence tells me is if you provide a fee-for-service practice there are pressures and it makes good sense any evidence would seem to bear this out that you see people for fewer a shorter times you see more people and you're more likely to do something like give them a prescription so you know that's kind of what you are sort of trained to do by your clinical work and the evidence would bear out that that seems to be what happens which is you can argue if it's good or bad right or wrong I think it's just a reality of the way we've built general practice in New Zealand and so it has more and more people come to develop an expectation that cannabis is a medicine that their doctor will prescribe you'll be under increasing pressure to provide cannabis as a medicine and it's going to be increasingly difficult for you not to do that and again it's not about your individual practice there will be about the social pressures of being a doctor in New Zealand and it's something important and for us to bear in mind so I had to think very quickly about the sorts of things that you might need to start thinking about when you think about talking to your patients about cannabis because they are probably come and speak to you rather than go to speak to rather than waiting for you to raise it with them so I think this is important I'm being clear that what we do and we're doctors in a talk about prescribing cannabis is not about decriminalization and not about condoning social use it isn't about these two pitches you'd be amazing if it's our grandma's smoking weed on the knee but some it's not this that we're talking about it's about the use of a particular medicine that we know what it is to do a particular job for a particular product that we need to be clear and honest with our patients that the evidence for the use of cannabis and many and many conditions is really weak so this isn't a place where we can say that there's good evidence that supports x4y you may have some anecdotal experience that you can tell or up but actually our science at the moment is pretty weak at best I think we can argue there the practice we are providing is evidence informed not evidence based debt doing nothing isn't the same as doing nothing at all so doing nothing is doing something and possibly doing something important so actually and I'm you guys may get way more of this than itix no one ever tells me not to prescribe antibiotics but I'm not prescribing is actually really important they're not prescribed it might be the best thing you can do for many people to come to see you over the next few years maybe not everybody but for meeting people over the next few years I can't imagine that smoking cannabis is either going to be okay and either going to be something that will be seen medically as being appropriate and unless you are have an intractable condition I guess I don't usually think about this and by intractable I mean something which is grossly impaired in your life you know severe epileptic disorders you know somewhat are cancer or something we're just going to kill you in weeks to months it's difficult to see how prescribing or cannabis use in any since we really add up there's a viable sensible proposition on the basis of the evidence to date which would suggest it significantly increases their risk for a small number of people a very serious condition for very serious conditions inside argue that you should get engaged I heat food from food speak oh I think is gone now that apparently the 18th of December you know 4th of December you know we already can prescribe and by the end of this year we are supposed to have in place mechanisms across the country which will allow this to be a lot easier to do so you know it's here and getting more and more here and probably your import more than my input is valuable here because it won't be me they're coming to see that ask we get we'd it'll be you guys you know I'll be the one they'll be coming to see you when they can't stop it hey that's all we really got to say [Applause]"
JF_vYlCt3AU,How To Get Medical Marijuana in Australia,2019-09-19T21:33:02Z,missus a TV here I hope you guys are having a very good one I'm talking to you guys from legal grasa chooses as always the heartland of America and hope you guys around the world are having a very good day so right now I wanted to sort of expand upon something I touched upon I want to see a couple weeks ago I talked about the process of or I I did a primer on the process of getting medical marijuana and Australia so right now I want to expand on it and I want to talk about an article that that goes and more depth on how to do it and but as usual I can be found on all of these platforms that can be found on Spotify iTunes pocket cast pod bean radio public stitcher tune in I Heart Radio and other platforms like it and without further ado let's get to the episode how to access medicinal cannabis in Australia by danika su saline despite the australian government's approving of the use of cannabis for medical purposes close to three years ago there's still some red tape in the way of australians getting access to the drug a lot of the information out there can be vague and confusing and seem a bit overwhelming if you have a medical condition or maybe your child's sick and you want to obtain more v natural but clinically proven treatment without turning to into a criminal for it australian medical cannabis ancillary services provider can ablate chief executive officer dr. sud argh well gave small caps the lowdown on exactly how access works in australia where can you get medical cannabis in australia in 2016 the narcotic drugs amendment 2016 came into effect in australia allowing doctors to legally prescribed medical cannabis to patients with specific medical conditions through the therapeutic group Goods Administration TGA special access scheme doctor argh well said that legalization occurred there has been an increase of the softening of regulations to prove eligibility for medical use it is federally opened it is the same essentially everywhere in Australia he said some people say there's a patient access per problem but it's not really a government problem anymore it's more a function of costs or the efficacy of the system that's our our girls added getting a prescription as you are probably aware medical cannabis is not an over-the-counter medication and you need a very and you need a very restricted restricted prescription for it however dr. R Rao said the biggest myth about the authorized prescriber scheme is that doctors need to be pre pre approved by the TGA to prescribe medical cannabis to patients any doctor can prescribe it now GP or specialist he said the vast majority of prescriptions probably 98% are not prescribed by authorised prescribers it's probably the biggest misconception they have prescribed they have they've been prescribed by regular doctors under special access scheme doctor our well explained still it's not as simple as popping to your GP and being issued a script you still need to have your medical condition verified as being appropriate for the treatment the doctor makes an application to the TGA to certify that it's a condition that would be appropriate use of cannabis and the product and that the product the doctor selected is an appropriate one to dr. argh well said usually there needs to be some form of clinical justification which usually is done attaching some form of medical literature evidence once you've gotten that within a very short period of time the TJ will confirm yes it's approved or no we need further information doctor ro said that the process is you very quick now it used to take weeks or months now it's often the same day or the next day approved according to the TGA to 893 special access scheme category B applications were approved in August 2019 this is almost 12 times more than the 229 approvals recorded in August at 2020 18 that's not a lot I mean Australia has like I think something like 37 million people that's a very very tiny number just it seems like it's seeing it still seems like a red tape sort of process for a lot of people though as this articles saying it's getting easier you know because like I said in like and in a lot of states and then the state's around 3% of the population in a given state becomes a medical gets a medical marijuana card in Oklahoma it so it's close to 4% but I don't know it just seems like a very low adoption rate if there's 30 million people in the entire country but I digress who could be prescribed medical cannabis the medical conditions that cannabis can be prescribed for is quite extensive but you can't use it to treat the common cold clinical trials and medical research has shown medical cannabis can assist in the treatment of symptoms for conditions not including but limited to not chronic pain syndrome neurological conditions of this epilepsy multiple sclerosis motor neuron diseases inflammatory inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's disease ulcerative colitis and chronic cancer pain and Molly's chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting arthritis dementia that there are Braille said that chronic pain is the most common reason the medical cannabis is prescribed followed by neurological diseases and inflammatory diseases there are a lot of people in between where they have a primary disease that has led to prologue and chronic pain and they're now taking it for that condition in conjunction with their the chronic pain medicine he said in addition to the majority of medical cannabis use is an adjuvant which helps improve the efficacy of other drugs this means it can enable a patient to lower the dose of their existing medication so they are not suffering from the same level of side-effects that's our de Waal said it's it is not uncommon for patients to take medical canvas in conjunction with their payments and reduce their total opiate dosage by 50% we've seen people who are taking anti-inflammatory medications such as steroids like pred prednisone and for inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease and they have reduced their steroid dose by 30 percent he added how easy it is is it to be approved despite antidotal stories of people being rejected by TGA and forced to obtain canvas elsewhere illegally dr. agua said that it's not too difficult to be approved but conceded that there's an art to writing the TGA justification letter I think you'd be unheard of for someone who is a bona fide candidate to get disapproved now he said if a patient is rejected by the tgd there's usually a request for further information issued by dr. agua said he has never had someone he thought was a bona fide candidate disapproved on the second-round application so that's that's a relief he added that there were no additional restrictions for prescribing medical cannabis for children but it'd be entirely down to the doctor's discretion to make sure he has the appropriate parental net monitoring and safety checks in place the doctor would need to be more mindful of dosing it about what the effects would be the most common concerns that doctors have is that they're going to overly sedate the patient and they're going to stop breeding I'm an anise anise cz Asst by a background so for me this is not a real fear but if you're a doctor who doesn't have experience with drugs or sedation it may appear to be a more complex task doctor argh well said getting the right dose according to dr. argh well the most common side effect of medical canvas is drowsiness another common side effect is dark kardia which the heart speeds up he said that there's a fine art in dose escalation which many doctors find comforting because medical canvas unlike conventional dogs drugs such as part-time model where a standard dose is administered every individual person has a different endocannabinoid system and one patient system sense of it 72 canvas might be different than the next person I maybe double your body weight but it may be that you would need twice the dose on me because you might have an endocannabinoid system that has resist there's more resistant to cannabinoids dr. arias explained the only way to absolutely be sure and this is what we do at all patients at my clinical practice is we start with the lowest actual dose required that be safe for the most sensitive person we recognize that 90% of people will not feel any benefit from that and this is where people have tried cannabis and said it never worked for them but they've probably just been under dose he said the dose is then doubled every day order the second day until therapeutic response is achieved as long as the patient is having appropriate therapeutic responses to underlining pathology without incurring any side-effects then we found our therapeutic window the thing is your therapeutic window and the next persons can be entirely different it could be by multiple five dr. agua said does medical cannabis contain THC depending on the condition being treated prescriptions could be for pure cannabidiol or CBD puss tetra hydro cannabidiol THC which is the psychoactive ingredient associated with producing the most euphoric effects of cannabis doctor are grell's said in in case of pediatric epilepsy patients tend to be prescribed a pure CBD mixture okay I'm just gonna sort of digress for a little bit um I mean you you guys in the States and and a lot of people cuz I she's she's got an international press so I wouldn't be surprised if she's well-known outside the states but cannabis activists and um epilepsy patient Alexis Martel says she uses whole flower that she needs THC as well she uses whole flower she doesn't just use the oil so again like like the doctor was referring to you know it's going to be different for everyone everyone has a different endocannabinoid system and in different sensitivity you know like for me I know for my my insomnia like therapy there you know there are reefer madness people trying to get between a doctor and patient relationships that say oh well you know people should just have CBD only the the the icky THC that gets people high and gets people having too much fun off their medicine shouldn't be allowed well that's BS because and we're all different I mean I need I have to have THC to get good to get good reliable sleep you know but there are some naysayers that like oh um CBD is good for insomnia well by itself it doesn't really do much for me you know but there are people out there that it does help but the whole sale ban teetsi or be like oh well I don't like the aforex of TC is a lawmaker and I still believe what Nancy Reagan and Ronald Reagan told me or or or any of the figures in your country told me in the 80s or 90s about how drugs are bad and and I don't think we should have access to THC because it makes people couch potatoes they don't get anything done you know that's that you're just feeding off your own bias and you're being tyrannical and restricting the the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship it should be between doctors and patients whether THC is appropriate or not and not knob it shouldn't be a decision left to reefer madness but again like I said Alexis she uses whole plant and she needs THC so it's not just so not all people with epilepsy only need CBDs for some of them it's not going to do the job and for some of them just using tinctures and oils in capsules ain't gonna do the job I mean like I either and I've often said that THC cat THC pills don't do a darn thing for me like I've tried them multiple times and like they don't they don't make me fall asleep I just feel like I took ambien and like I mentioned in the pilot episode ambien just like I just I'm just up all night and then I wake up like I have a hangover that's three times as bad is alcohol that's what ambien does for me for some people they take ambien you know and knocks them the eff out but for me you know it just keeps it it doesn't work it just keeps me up and then I have the biggest headache on the planet you know when I closed my eyes for six to eight hours but again we're all different we all need different concentrations and again it should be left to the doctor and patient and no law no lawmaker no MP no prime minister should get in the way of that however in the case of chronic pain some THC would assist some patients might have more THC than CBD it might be a 1 to 5 ratio it depends on what the underlying pathology you have is he said flipping the script so now you've got the prescription with the TGA approval stamp to it you can go to any pharmacy and get that script filled doctor are all said that the pharmacy near the patient can organize for the product to be dispatched from can of lates warehouse to where everything you live in Australia that's that's great I mean hopefully hopefully in Australia you don't have like like we have like we have delivery medical marijuana and a lot of the legal medical marijuana states but I know in my state I don't know about like California or I don't know about Colorado and you know I haven't really been there but I know in my state with delivery a lot of these Espenson so you have to there's like $100 minimum so you have to spend $100 - for the for the people to deliver so if you if you don't have a car or your car is broken down or you know you don't have gas money to get get your drive to the place and get your medicine or a ride to get there don't want to spend over or whatever you're Sol because you know you're having to spend over $100 then you're having to tip the delivery person so you're out a hundred and twenty dollars just to be able to pick up your medicine you know just to have it deliver to you that's how it works in my state I'm sure it's different it might even be better in other states but I know here that's that's the case so you know in times when I had car issues I had I had to take the train all the way into the city and and and spend a lot more of my time to get the medicine because I would otherwise I'd have to pee I'd have I have $100 minimum I would have to spend in order to get in I think sometimes I don't want to spend that but it's it's good to hear that they have that in Australian all hopefully they don't have the same issue we we've got over 600 pharmacies now in our network and 98% of the population should have to go less than two kilometres as most people live in urban areas what a pharmacy nearby you said cost and sub-sub sedation unlike most medicines in Australia medical cannabis is not subsidised under the pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Victoria has a compassionate and access scheme which funds medical cannabis for a limited number of children with vier epilepsy New South Wales scheme can be granted for adults with terminal illness however dr. agua said that under 1% of patients use the schemes they received compounded with non branded products as can valeted allows any manufacturer to sell through its network the company doesn't have control of the pricing however dr. our well said that the typical ballpark figure was between $200 and 600 a month yeah it sounds about right sounds what about what we pay in the states and a lot of medical states it's expensive having said that only of recent times as in the last few weeks there's now cheaper products from Columbia and LaSalle though shout-out to you guys I saw there in Columbia we love you guys from listening from Columbia and masado shout out to you guys all the way a small country landlocked inside South Africa which are much lower cost products he said medical cannabis versus homegrown so what's to stop the ordinary Australia from growing their own the most obvious reason is the criminal implications cultivating a leo canvas is a serious offence in all states and territories in Australia depending on the severity penalties can range from large fines right up to life imprisonment that's a yikes for me dog whoa but I'm but yeah I mean and a lot of states that's that's still the case doctor our well said another important difference is the dose is known and when you get medical cannabis from a doctor its infection free because it has been packed in a sterile manner in addition he said it's been manufactured under the gun manufacturing practice which means so uncertified it and someone certified it does not contain heavy metals or bacteria and each dose you get contains the same amount of active ingredients each time if you crush some bits of a plant when take on Monday night might be different than Tuesday generally with medicines you want to get the safest dose that allows you to achieve the desired therapeutic effect without the side effects I can see you I can't see you achieving that would plant dosing very easily doctor our brows I added the next generation of medical cannabis products doctor our girl said it's important for can-can of late to be multifaceted in the cannabis industry since it has a relatively early stage industry where people need a lot of different services in addition to its distribution network which covers 40% of all prescriptions in Australia it has a research division that's currently running 12 clinical trials for a range of indications some of those trials with the impression healthcare of which dr. arkeville has recently appointed as chief medical officer dr. R Rao said the most exciting aspect of the company is the novel cannabinoid drug discovery division which is only about four months in the making via this arm involves developing novel cannabinoid using a mixture of ingredients and validating them for such specific diseases dr. arkeville called it canvas 2.0 a unique product for a unique disease he said at the moment people are buying genetic generic canvas oil where it doesn't matter what company are getting it from but the next generation of canvas products will need to be more disease specific if can ovate can develop a lead candidate it will be DRS product then will have been shown through trials to work better than regular generic generic cannabis in addition the dosing will be tighter because they'll be clinically validated and measured in control experiments to be effective at very specific target receptors in the human body this can mean far less trial and error when it comes to patients finding a dosage that is similar that is suitable to their condition which is reassuring for both patients and they're prescribing practitioners and of article so yeah so this is the end of the article what I'm gonna try to do in the show notes is I'm gonna put access to can adopters NEET near your area I'll try to see if I can put additional resources that can help and as always I can be found on the following platforms that can be fine on iTunes anchor pocket cast radio public pod being Spotify stitcher tune in radio I Heart Radio and other platforms like it I can be found on over ten ten or more platforms and I'm sure you'll find one that is is good for your needs and also I can be followed on Twitter and I see sativa podcast and I'm on Instagram and I am cannabis sativa with both the S is there and if you also find yourself liking my content and coming around to it often you can also become a patreon at the link above and as always I hope you guys got a lot out of this and I hope the rest of your day treats you well
KGUAcMfU-5E,Australian trends in cannabis use and attitudes towards legalisation,2019-11-04T10:33:46Z,"good morning everybody and welcome to the crims webinar series it's fantastic to have you with us here this morning and you may have seen some of our upcoming webinars as you are waiting to view the session today and I'd really encourage you to check those out and go and sign up for those on other interesting topics around comorbid mental health and substance use and those are all available as well as the recording for today's webinar and the handouts which will be posted on comorbidity dot edu - au training so my name is Louise Bureau I'm a postdoctoral research fellow here at the center of research excellence in mental health and substance use and before I introduce our speaker today for those of you who aren't familiar with the center and I'll just give a quick overview of what the CRA and mental health and substance use or cremes is and what we do so at cremes we conduct research into improving our understanding of mental health and substance use disorders particularly why these problems tend to co-occur together within the same individuals so we work to develop improved strategies and conducting research and how to more effectively treat and understand these problems and so it should to achieve these aims we work closely with services schools community providers and treatment service providers and this webinar series is another way that we hope to keep these lines of communication open and translate our research into the wider community so it's great that you're all joining us here today and we've also included a photo of our team here the team is led by Professor Murray teason who you'll see in the pink and at the front there as well as a range of researchers here working at the Center so without any further ado it is my absolute pleasure to introduce our speaker for today who is dr. wendy swift wendy is a senior lecturer at cremes and her current research focuses around the epidemiology and natural history and consequences of cannabis and alcohol use and dependence cannabis potency an Australian cannabis market and substance use particularly among older Australians as well and we're really fortunate to have her with us today to talk through some recent trends in Australian data around cannabis use and attitudes towards cannabis legalization and so without any further ado it's my pleasure to hand over to Wendy now and we'll also have an opportunity to ask Wendy questions at the end of the webinar if you do have some questions as we're going through please jot those down and we'll have a bit of a discussion towards the end it's now my pleasure to hand over to Wendy great thanks very much Louise and I'm good morning everybody as always said I'm going to be talking today about Australian trends in cannabis use and legalization over the last since the beginning of the 21st century and it will incorporate a bit of a summary of what we know plus some recent very recent data that we've just analyzed from the National Household Survey series so this talk is this research is a collaboration with my crims colleague colleagues Tim Slade and Kath Chapman Michael Livingston from Latrobe University in Victoria and two colleagues from Columbia University in the USA ava Hamilton and Kerry Keyes who are experts in the sorts of analysis that I'm going to be talking about today so just to start I thought we'd start off with a couple of questions to see what you might think you know about recent trends in cannabis use and attitudes so to start off I thought I'd ask the question recent Australian data show cannabis use has been increasing in the population amongst which groups is it a the entire Australian population be younger Australians or see older Australians so if you aren't happy to put in your answers we'll see what you come up with so you should have a pole appearing on your screen or you can click one of the answers we've got some pencils coming in Wendy I think most people have voted now and I can say that we had 29% of people report that the entire population was the correct answer that the vast majority have voted that they think it's amongst older Australians and they would be correct actually that's very knowledgable of your Hall well done I'll talk about that in a minute one more question again in recent surveys in general what do Australian populations survey show is that that Australians increasingly favor cannabis legalization do they show that most people believe that cannabis should remain illegal or most people have no opinion again you'll see the poll on your screen I think most people have voted now and we've got 85% of people voting a increasing favor of cannabis legalization with 15% of people voting they believe Congress should remain legal okay and is correct so I don't really need to give my talk now my god that's correct and again we'll be talking about those issues in the talk so that was just two quick little questions and I shall start my talk in earnest now the slide that's up now is for showing some of the data from the latest national drug strategy household survey which is the population survey run every three years by the Australian Government on all drugs Australians use and these are the 2016 data which are not available to analyse yet but they put out the initial reports looking at last year illicit drug use and trends since the 2001 serve and you can see in the top right graph the proportion of Australians who use methamphetamine has fallen the proportion who used cocaine have risen but cannabis still remains up the top there on that Green Line there was a dip from 21 to 2001 to 2007 and there's been a sort of gradual increase again up to the current survey if you look at the bottom left graph the last year use by age this goes to my first question if you look at the marijuana or cannabis graphic in the top left corner you can see that the the bars represent years of the survey with the top bar 2001 the bottom bars 2016 has actually been an increase in use amongst older age groups with the yellowish and white bars down the bottom and the 40 to 49 year old age group becoming longer whereas amongst the younger age groups 14 to 19 you can see that there's been a decrease largely in use as surveys have become more recent so cannabis do use did peak worldwide in the late 1990s and early 2000s and then it declined but it does appear to be on the increase again since then internationally Australia is traditionally being one of the highest using nations and cannabis has remained the most commonly used illicit drug in Australia so as you can see uses on the increase amongst older Australians if you just have a quick look at this recent use graph it just provides a bit more of an an outline of that it's again 2016 data along with methamphetamine cannabis is the most this is the drug that's most used most frequently that is at least weekly so 36 percent of recent cannabis users use weekly or more often and that was the same with methamphetamine but there have been some trends so there's been an increase in the age of initiation so people are starting it later there's been an increase in the average age of users so people are on average older when they're using these days there's been a decrease in the number of younger users and an increase in the number of older users especially males and use among males aged 40 to 59 and people over 60 is now at its highest in 15 years which raises the question are we seeing the effects of increased use because of an ageing cohort and again these issues will come up again again this raises the question has Australia has cannabis sorry gone off the Australian agenda so as recently pointed out cannabis is still the most commonly used and frequently used illicit drug in Australia and in turn along with methamphetamine and in terms of treatment cannabis is the drug for which people most commonly seek illicit drug treatment along with me that Amin so approximately 23% of people who sought treatment with seeking treatment for cannabis or methamphetamine in 2015-2016 but there's been an increasing media and policy focus on other drugs so it's gone off the agenda and straily abit there's been concerns over issues such as ice pharmaceutical opioids and novel psychoactive substances there's been an increase in the popularity of media coverage of other drugs and in the in the recent national drug strategy household surveys people's perceptions of methamphetamine has changed considerably such that people now consider it to be of more concern than any other drug including alcohol and a greater number have thought of it as the drug that's caused the most deaths in Australia for the first time methamphetamine was a drug most likely to be nominated as a drug problem so there's been a bit of a shift in the way people perceive drug use in terms of cannabis policy in Australia cannabis has remained illegal in Australia for forever really now laws have varied in various states according to the jurisdictions so we've had various states for instance South Australia very early on into introduced some form of decriminalization and civil penalties and depending which state you live in there may be some form of diversion from the criminal justice system into the drug courts or into cautioning there'll be just discretion given to police as to how they deal with offences for minor offenses so there is some movement in that but overall in Australia cannabis has always been illegal and it currently is illegal there is also been little attention to medical cannabis in Australia despite some movement in New South Wales in about 2007 it never ever happened so it's been some compassionate and prescribed access to cannabis but it's been very difficult there's been very very very little attention given to cannabis um research on medical cannabis in Australia and there's been a lot of barriers I the first potency um results for Australian cannabis a few years ago but it took me ten years to get that study off the ground largely because the laws in Australia made it virtually impossible to access cannabis for research purposes so it's been very much a sort of policy our situation in Australia but what what has happened in 2016 is a new law was passed in Australia so the federal parliament passed landmark legislation called the narcotic drugs Amendment Act which became effective on the 30th of October and now allows the controlled cultivation of cannabis in Australia for medicinal and related scientific purposes by our national licensing scheme so it has a detailed regulatory framework which enables applications for licenses and permits for the cultivation production and manufacture of medicinal cannabis products so that's an extremely new situation in Australia and something we watch with interest in terms of Australian attitudes towards legal status we touched on this at the beginning with the question there have been a few surveys now that are showing that this does seem to be some sort of softening of attitudes toward legal status in Australia so Roy Morgan have run a series of polls over the years of Australians and they have found since 2004 that there has been an increase in those who believe cannabis should be legalized particularly amongst the young and the old the Australian National University have run a periodic election study where they look at a variety of issues around politics and social issues and between 27 2007 sorry and 2016 there was a sharp decrease in the proportion of their respondents who believed cannabis use should be a criminal offence Marian Shanahan who's a health economist here at n dark did as part of her doctorate looked at people's attitudes towards cannabis use policies and they found when people were forced to make a discrete choice experiment where they'll ask to make different choices about cannabis options for Policy they found there was a strong preference for civil penalties and a strong dislike of an increase in the camp criminalization of cannabis and it was linked to people's beliefs about the benefits the cannabis might be able to confer on people these are the latest data on attitudes - from the National Drug Strategy household surveys so there has been a market increase in support for cannabis from 26% believing legalization should be an option in 2013 to 35% in 20s so you can see down the left has been a general increase in the more liberal policies for cannabis use and people increasingly want civil penalties for cannabis use just a slide here this is not the best slide in the world and you cannot find a slide that agrees with any other slide if you try and get a slide of cannabis policy internationally every slide is different and even the Australian one is not completely accurate what I just wanted to show you was that around the world there has been a lot of movement in cannabis policy apart from in Australia with for instance the United States obviously the each state in the United States have increasingly adopted medical marijuana programs there's been a lot of movement there Canada's about to legalize recreational use has been increased movement in South America and in various parts of Europe toward the legalization of or decriminalization and various aspects of cannabis use there's been a massive increase in medical cannabis programs and the use of pharmaceutical cannabis around the world and a lot of money invested in medical research looking at the medicinal effects of cannabis and Australia has been largely excluded from that that movement and there's been a lot of policy stasis until quite recently until last year's policy decision there's been a bit of concern to expressed about what happens when policies are changed so what is the relationship between policies attitudes and use so does it increase for instance in the number of American states who have medical cannabis mean that there's going to be an increase in just your recreational use or are people's attitudes going to change is it going to increase people's belief about how harmful it is is is it going to result in an increase in use that we need to be concerned about and basically there's been a lot of study but the results have been very different determined depending on they've been lots of different methodologies and outcomes measured and that there are mixed results and impacts on people's views of her harmful cannabis ease and use the policy think-tank in the United States Rand did a sir a review looking at the links between us medical cannabis laws and use and they found it in fact there was a link between the introduction of medical cannabis laws in the United States and increased adult use but not youth use Kathryn Keyes is collaborating with us on this study found that despite overall decreases in perceived harmfulness medical marijuana laws resulted in increased levels of perceived harmfulness in young so what does that mean hmm oh okay despite overall decreases in perceived harmfulness across the whole population medical marijuana inspect FML resulted in increased levels of the same harmfulness in young adolescents who then decrease their use there been other studies that have looked at at this and found that there are basically across-the-board decreasing perceptions of the dangers of cannabis among adolescent birth cohorts internationally low disapproval has been linked to higher risk of adolescent use and beau Kilmer who also works at ran has found that the increase in support for the legalization of cannabis has been in lockstep with the support for same-sex marriage in the United States and that there's been a general what's called a period effect or historic effect showing that there's broad changes happening in the United States in regard to a whole lot of inches so it's a very complicated situation with no single answer when we're trying to sort of untangle these trends and understand what they all mean we need to try and disentangle what might be going on because these trends can be affected by a variety of issues and the three main issues they can be affected by our peoples age so that is an effect that is present can differ over people's life course so for instance we typically understand that cannabis use picks in young adulthood and decreases as people age and that's the same with most drug use that drug use doesn't differ over the life course depending on what stage of your life you're in drug use can also do for according to an historical period so there could be something happening in the period for instance the policy could be implemented there could be massive periods of social change that mean that drives changes across the entire halation regardless of your age or what this cohort you were being born in and the third trend of course can be because of cohort changes that is an effect can differ according to when you were born so for instance people born in a particular point of time have more in common with other people born at that time and they can show changes that differ according to different birth cohort so one of the well-known ones is the baby boomer group for instance in which drug use really boomed in the late 1960s because that's when a lot of inglis of drug use was introduced into that cohort so they tend to have different patterns according to different um different birth cohorts before I go on to looking at age period cohort analysis in more detail I just wanted to also raise the question of a different trend which is gender gap trend which we're tending to seeing in rates of drug use where people who were born in the early 20th century tend to be much more different if you're a male or a female than those who were born in the late 1900s so that the initial gender gap where we typically think that drug use rates are higher in men has seemed to be on the decrease in more recent birth cohorts now Jim Slade Kath Chapman and I have written two papers now on these trends in both alcohol and cannabis use using big combined samples from international studies that have looked at rates of alcohol and cannabis prevalence over time now the data that I've got up here are from the alcohol paper over four million people and we found that if you look at the graph that as you got a more recent birth cohort the basically the gender gap narrowed such that if you've got any alcohol use problematic use of alcohol harms the ratio of male to female use really decreased down to about one now the basically the cannabis paper although we used a different sample and slightly different outcomes we found much the same result that there was a decrease in the male to female ratio of two in those born in 1941 to 1.3 in those born in 1995 suggesting that women and men's use of alcohol canvas has become more similar over time and these findings aren't my slide will not advance let me just see if this these findings have seemed to resonate really strongly with the public the there was a lot of media particularly over the alcohol study it was mentioned in English Parliament and I think that's because they've reflected what many people have observed in their own research and anecdotally in schools treatment settings and within their own communities so that's something to keep in mind it was one of the questions were interested in looking at in this study just in terms of there's not a lot of literature on age period cohort analysis not many people have done these sorts of analysis but when we have looked at the studies that have been done in the United States there's been a general increase in in cannabis use in the United States over the last several years there's been five studies in the USA and four in German I'm sorry one in Germany four in Australia America sorry one in Germany over the years 1982 to 2015 now the for us studies have all been on the same cohort and what they've done is each studies looked at them for an increasingly longer and longer period of time and essentially they found that the trends driving the increase in use in the USA were related purely to historical trends so something has been happening across the American Society rather than in an age or cohort sense that is driving increase in use the German study wasn't really particularly relevant because it was they have found primarily that it was age that was driving studies but it was driven by people a lot of people trying cannabis and then a drop in that a drop-off so they weren't maintained those trends they found that there was little impact of the cannabis policy per se and queried whether it was actually changes in attitudes that were driving changes in news rather than policy per se in terms of age period cohort analysis on legalization attitudes have been two big studies in the United States that have specifically looked at this and the first one very similar time periods the first one from the 70s to 2014 and found a dramatic period effect here as well of increasing support for cannabis legal for the late 1990s so again a general historical effect across society coupled with a very smaller cohort effect so there was also effect of people born in the baby boomer cohort being more supportive of supporting legalization for cannabis in the second study there was a similar period effect from the 1980s so we're getting a lot of a lot of evidence that use and legalization attitudes in on sex is driven very much by a general historical change in the second studies safety and at perceived safety and attitudes to legalization were moved in tandem you can see in this graph here that as views on marijuana safety change so did use on whether or not cannabis legality should be changed from 1976 up to 2015 okay so it brings us to the study that we're doing so Australia is an interesting case study because we have been Australia's been at the forefront of drug policy and in harmonization etc for decades now internationally but in terms of cannabis use we've really been in a stasis in terms of cannabis and policy potential policy change in medical cannabis and then this is in the context of substantial policy change internationally so it's but it's an interesting case study because we can look at changes in attitudes and use in a period where nothing has really changed in Australia so the aim of what we're doing this preliminary results is to look at and compare trends from 2001 National Household Survey to 2013 now the 2016 data will be added but they've just come out so we're looking at recent use so last year use and attitudes toward legalization and criminalization now the National national drug strategy household survey as I'm sure many of you are aware is an ongoing series of population surveys of those aged 14 plus it's it's conducted every three years and they asked about all the major drug classes policy attitudes treatment your life circumstances etc some of the questions change over time which makes this sort of analyses difficult we were originally going to do this this research on alcohol attitudes but because that the questions not now colleges on binge drinking but the the data were just there was so much missing data and insights such incomparable data across time we just couldn't do it was the cannabis that has remained fairly fairly consistent we were also interested obviously in seeing if we could look at what differences there might be in cannabis use and whether there was any sort of at least initial descriptive evidence of a decrease or maintenance or increase in an inner gender gap so when you combine the ages 14 to 79 across these periods in 2001 to 13 we get about 120,000 people or so about half of whom were female we categorized them into a different age and birth cohort ranges consistent with the way these other studies have been done so we've got five waves of data and they're currently the analyses are descriptive and we need to run further modeling to confirm these in a quantitative method at the moment they presented by gender but we're also going to look at them by peoples tobacco smoking status and education because these two factors are well known to have an effect will be related at least to cannabis use so when they're 2016 National Household Survey data are released at the end of the year we aim to incorporate these entire analysis so remember because we're presenting results by gender we can't directly compare but you can at least have a look at how they may or may not differ so the three main questions we're looking at here are the three main outcomes are based on these questions have you used cannabis or marijuana in the last 12 months so it's yes or no and then two on attitudes do you think the possession of small quantities of marijuana or cannabis for personal use should be a criminal offence that is should offenders get a criminal record and we have yes no and don't know and then the last question is to what extent would you support or oppose the personal use of marijuana can of cannabis being made legal and there was a like Hut scale a Likert scale sorry which range from strongly agree to strongly disagree so we counted strongly agree and agree as evidence of support for the legalization of personal use of cannabis so I'm just going to go through the results with you now I hope I'm not rushing through this too much but I suppose it leaves time for discussion okay this is just the first eyeball this is not part of the age period cohort analysis but just a little graph of basically males are down the bottom females at the top by age and we're looking at whether they've used cannabis in the last year or not so for each graph we have the results from the 2001 down to the 2013 survey with red being 2001 and a purple down the bottom being 2013 and what there is evidence of is a decrease in use in more recent surveys particularly in in the younger group so you can see at the beginning in the younger group there's much greater separation in use with more recent survey showing lower use amongst those age groups that by the older age groups just isn't there so let's see what happens when we actually do an age pure cohort analysis now it looks a bit messy but I'll explain it too so on the Left we have a graph showing the results for males and on the right we have a graph showing the results for females so we have three pieces information on that graph down the bottom there's there's a legend that says there's age so the left-hand graph is what happens from 14 to 79 in recent use for males and females as they age and that's basically what proportion have used cannabis in the middle and on the right we have a different scale and the middle it's what birth cohort they were born in so from 1917 or so up to 1998 or so I can't remember exactly what it is but the 1950 here is the reference group so we're comparing things to that group and that's done just basically on the numbers in groups it's it doesn't necessarily mean anything in and of itself but it's just a point for comparison and on the right you have that little graph looking at period so from 2001 to fifteen and this is like a relative risk so one is basically no difference and if you've got a positive relative risk your chance of using is increased and if it's below one your chance of using is decreased so I'll go through these you can see initially though that there's a very similar pattern for males and females and for both males and females then all three effects were significant so it was driven by cohort effects period effects and age effects but the strongest driver of effect in this group is the cohort effect so that is depending on which cohort you were born in you had different levels of risk of recent use and if you look at the middle graph with the 1950s a reference group essentially what it's saying is that there was a very low level of use from the early birth cohorts up to those born in the 1950s then recent use was highest amongst baby boomer cohort up to those born in the mid 1960s and then in recent cohorts use has decreased which is consistent with some of those initial graphs we've seen from the National Household Survey that it's basically the older groups the older groups born in the baby boomer cohort that are continuing on with recent use the period effect shows there was a decrease for both males and females up to the year 2007 which is the reference group and thereafter there has been an increase in use as we've seen in the early graphs that has been a bit of a rebound in cannabis use if you just go back to the cohort effect I just forgot to mention if you look at where the males cross that vertical horizontal line at one the men go back down to having sort of lower than average in recent cohorts but you can see that for the women it's the dark line in the middle that you're looking at the two lines around it are the confidence intervals if you look at the women women have not decreased there is in more recent birth cohorts the women have not decreased their use as much which seems to be some evidence of gender gap closing there at whilst the highest use was in the baby boomer birth cohorts the decrease in recent use amongst more recent birth cohorts is not as significant among women as it is among yet men which does seem to support the gender gap in terms of age which had the least effect there was just a general increase in cannabis use up to mid 20s and then a decrease with ages as we've come to expect if we look at support for cannabis legalization it's the same concept in terms of reading these graphs as they age on the Left cohort in the middle and period on the right again we have similar largely similar effects for men and women and whether or not people agree that cannabis should be legalized but they're driven by very different things so in the men it seems to be driven by an historical trend so first men seem to be more interested in supporting legalization for unknown at the stage historical reasons so there's been a decrease in those supporting cannabis legalization from 2001 to 2007 but in recent years that has increased and so there's a greater support amongst men and you can see on the right for women period effect was the second biggest effect there has been a similar trend but less pronounced women's armed support for legalization has very much been driven by age so there basically started off pretty flat with about a quarter supporting legalization when they're young and it just decreases with age so women tend to be more conservative here with men you can see for men there's an increase in those who support come cannabis legalization with their age up to age 35 and then it decreases but yeah the cohort effect is stronger amongst men again the baby boomer cohort that middle cohort where you can see the inverted u-shaped graph there there seems to be again a stronger support for legalization amongst the baby boomer cohort for both men and women but it's stronger for men than in women if we look at the other attitude that we examined which was whether or not personal use or possession possession of cannabis should be criminalized there is a trend again across time they've got females at the top males at the bottom 14 to 18 on the left with increasing age across across the graph and then the DIF colors representing the different years there tends to have been a decrease in the proportion of people who believe cannabis should be criminalized in more recent surveys particularly it seems with age is the greater separation of the of the lines with in recent surveys but what does the age cohort analysis tell us about this there was no period effect so unlike the American research which showed believes beliefs about criminalization and legalization were driven very much by general historical trends in these data while our legalization data would driven by historical trends there was no evidence of that when beliefs about possession being criminalized were were looked at so there's a bit of a difference here it's quite consistent though with the data that Marianne Shanahan as I said did when she did that force choice experiment where people were in favor of legalization and also in favor of decriminalizing offence offenses so what happened here is we get an age effect and a cohort effect for both males and females but primarily an age effect so with our males and females there tends to be an increase as people get to middle age that increase in the belief that cannabis should be criminalized but then as people age particularly on the right there amongst women the graph drops a lot more down as women age they tend to have a decreasing belief that cannabis should be criminalized so they tend to become less conservative as they age in terms of the view of possession which contrasts to their views on legalization so it's quite paradoxical for women again with the cohort the cohort that tended to have the most liberal views on this so the ones that had the lowest proportion of people who believe cannabis should be criminalized was the baby boomer cohort so not really any surprises there it seems to be a very liberal cohort if you like one more thing we did look at was just the don't knows because there are quite a lot of people who just really didn't know and if you didn't know you seem to be most strongly driven by an historical trend and this is basically if you didn't know you sort of wave it all over the place if you look at that period line there was sharp increase in the proportion from 2001 who just didn't know up to 2007 that red line which is a reference group and then the number of don't knows decrease announced on the increase again so this is a really a lot of uncertainty amongst people for both men and women and again that seems to be largely driven by historical effects there so if you know what you think you're not driven by what's going on in general in a society but if you don't know you are it's also driven very much by age so as you get older particularly from among women you're increasingly uncertain and as your birth cohort gets more recent you were born more recently you're also increasingly uncertain so there is a lot of uncertainty out there as well so just to summarize we found that there are similar trends for men and women in terms of recent use and potentially women's there was a bit of a decrease in obviously and you see more recent cohorts in the more recent birth cohorts and an increase in use in more recent surveys but they did seem to be some evidence for a gender gap that is women's decreases in the more recent surveys were less than the men's which is consistent with what's being found in the general trend literature and cannabis when people have investigated this so the recent news trends are dominated by cohort effect so is the baby boomers and the ageing cohort that seemed to be driving these recent trends in use so increases in use in recent surveys are not driven by young people taking cannabis up it's by baby boomers and older people continuing to use we've also found that there are some period effects so something's going on in accross society in a general sense that's driving news trends in terms of attitudes these very much seem to depend on the outcome we measured and the gender of the participant in the survey so in terms of legalization there was a similarity in general trends for men and women but it was driven by an historical period for men so they found support increased over time was driven by age for women who tended to have lower support for legalization with age position however whether or not possession of cannabis you should be criminalized was driven my age and birth cohort for both men and women but there was no historical trend or period trend there there was greatest support ELISA released support that's a mistake there was least support for criminalization of position amongst the baby boomers who seem to be most liberal of all of the birth cohorts and there was also less support amongst older women as I said it was paradoxical as they age they had less support for legalization but as they age they also didn't want kind of as criminalized and potentially if people are unsure their sins we may be more swayed by current policy debates perhaps that are going on there are some interesting things going on and we can have some discussion about what might be driving these these changes the first thing we need to look at obviously is what might be driving Australian trends in cannabis use and at this stage we've got no changes in policies or anything major that's happened in Australian society that could potentially be doing this unfortunately we couldn't look at what people's views of the harms of cannabis were because the question changed throughout the period that we were looking at the survey so that unfortunately changed the way it was measured so we can't look to see if changes and attitudes sort of went in lockstep with changes in people's belief about the perceived harms of of cannabis we do need longer-term data to see how this plays out particularly since the introduction of cannabis some legislation enabling medical cannabis in Australia so the first start of course is confirming our model extending it to 2016 and then trying to find out what mechanisms might be driving these differences but I'm going to end there now and go back to Louise who might open the forum up for discussion or questions Thank You Wendy that was absolutely brilliant and so many fascinating questions that I'm sure that will come out of that presentation so for those of you following along there should be a questions on your panel and I'd really encourage you to type any questions that you might have so dr. swift so we can have a discussion at the end of the webinar today but just to start us off Wendy I wanted to ask you about Australia's medical cannabis program and your thoughts on how this might have influenced community attitudes in some of the data that we've seen today well Australia's medical program has been non-existent so it's probably had no no impact in Australia but what the the things that might be driving these increased approvals so it's quite interesting in the United States there's what they've found is there's been a general increase in support for more liberal policy that's been brought quite broad-based so there has been more specific stuff like a decrease in the perceived harms associated with cannabis but there's also been more general across-the-board social policy changes so beau Kilmer in the ran the random review found that there's also been an increase that's kept pace with the cannabis increase in support for for gay marriage so there may be just general societal changes that are driving these things in the United States also with the introduction of the medical marijuana laws there in each state there's been some some findings that it's potentially attitudes people's attitudes that have driven these state policies toward medical cannabis and then these policies have then gone on to to drive attitudes so it's quite complicated and in fact he goes so far as to say that the medical marijuana laws have in a sense been a Trojan horse for legalization changes in the United States that they've brought cannabis into a sort of level of acceptance that have made the whole concept of legalizing cannabis much more acceptable which are in the United States which has always had the war on drugs you would sort of never have thought it would have happened but it seems to have sort of crept in there whereas in Australia we haven't ever had a change in policy we've never had a a marijuana model or for medical provision so we don't know whether we're going to follow the United States in our attitudes because there's so many differences they're finding in the United States too that these things are very much depend on whether you're a Democrat or a Republican if you're you know if you're a white Caucasian or a black American so there's all sorts of different things in terms of your socio demographic characteristics it's quite interesting though that Michael Livingstone who we collaborated with on this paper is just released I'm a paper looking at the National Drug Strategy household survey attitudes on alcohol over the same time period this came I just saw it a couple of days ago and in fact what's happened with alcohol is quite the opposite to cannabis there's been a massive increase in the concern across all ages from 2001 to 13 in alcohol so he's wondering if that has now been because there's been a bit more negative feedback in the media about media coverage on alcohol and there's been big increases in concern across all age groups and that he's wondering if it's related to the decrease in youth consumption we're seeing in alcohol now and that particularly if there's negative attitudes have become more prevalent in in young people's formative years when they're starting to take up alcohol that it may have more of an influence on their use so it's quite interesting to see what's happening there as opposed to what's happened with cannabis yeah that's fascinating and you mentioned that you would have loved to have done a similar analysis that you've done today with the binge drinking other really interesting parts of your research is disclosing gender gap between men and women in recent cohorts and well I know they started to look into their mechanisms he said that's potentially an area that you're hoping to look into in the future but you have any sense of what might be driving this closing gender gap or what might be behind that we're seeing with women catching up to them well this is there's been a bit of discussion about what's driving whether it's a greater increase in use amongst women in recent cohorts or that's just that women are decreasing they use less than the men and there's evidence for both and some of the the findings of discussion points around this have been perhaps women are more responsive to policy change that changes in policy around because these these gender gaps literature reviews have been based on international literature is very few from Australia mostly in the United States and in Europe that that women may there may be some relationship between policy changing changes in women's use but mostly it's centered around the discussion um that they've been changes in social norms women seem to have greater differences in their perceive risk there may be more responsive to changes and there's also been Geographic and temporal change in the social roles and economic conditions of women throughout the 20th century so perhaps of women have become more equal if you like to men in terms of their societal roles their drinking patterns and their cannabis use patterns have also become more similar to men's because there's maybe this stigma associated with use sarah less barriers perhaps to them using in a similar manner yeah fascinating and I was wondering if you could comment on some of the potential health implications of this study I mean is this suggesting that we would have different health messages targeted for different age groups or cohorts or what kind of round it's quite interesting because if it's the I suppose the good news is that people are starting cannabis use later even though the increase is happening it's not being driven by younger people although where the difference lies is that it's being driven more the decrease is less among women than men so I suppose we need to for women to be aware that if they're not decreasing their use as much as men particularly younger women that perhaps they need to be a particular target of messages about cannabis related harms but in general I think it's good news for younger people because if they're delaying initiation till later and they're not using as much then they're not setting themselves up for the risks that when I use and adolescents can really confer because it's it's early regular use of cannabis and adolescents when the brain is plastic and you know people social roles and transitional roles are all changing that really can cause a lot of damage so that is good news there is evidence that people are starting to take things up later and potentially as people's people have been tending to delay the uptake about our roles there's been evidence from a variety of servers it shows that people are staying adolescent for longer that they're staying at home longer and they're not they're not transitioning to adult as early as they used to the other thing is too that though well it might be good news for younger people for people who are continuing to smoke as they get into middle and older age that's not necessarily a good a good thing because they're exposing themselves now to a longer proportion of their life span where they're smoking cannabis and we know that most people do smoke cannabis and that it's the smoking that's the biggest risk in terms of rid of administration in terms of exposure to carcinogens and there's not a lot of good long-term data well we've studied people long enough to see what happens when you follow people who started smoking I suppose those results will be coming out looking at the really longer-term impacts on cognitive function on respiratory health and various other things that people who do continue their use which seems to be happening amongst this baby boomer cohort so that is of concern and there's one more thing of course is that with this change in legislation in terms of health implications it does make the role of of people doing research into the medical uses of cannabis easier so I'm hoping to see Australia start to join the ranks of the world with doing some really interesting and valuable research on what benefit are the whole cannabis or extra pharmaceutical extracts of canvas might have for various medical conditions definitely it's a real opportunity this Australian research at the moment which is great and so what are the next steps for you with this period of piece of research it's pretty much finishing this off at the moment we're just trying to get permission now to use the 2016 data to add and then we're going to try and confirm our models and just check that they do in fact hold if we do the results a couple of different ways and be more stringent about the sorts of things we not control for but you know we say okay how does education affect this how does smoking status affect this and to try and just get a better fine-grained analysis of it and then we'll write up a paper on it and disseminate the results out for that yeah fantastic and just one last question before we go in this other people have any questions to type in today you mentioned that particularly the people who are undecided with people who may be more swayed by policy and debates around legalization issues I was wondering what kind of percentages you're talking about of people who didn't have undecided attitudes was that a big chunk of the sample of the relatively small numbers was it wasn't to be honest well if you look at if I go back through the graph don't know is if you look on the left the left is percentage of people across different age groups so it ranged for instance in the men between 8 and almost 20% of men across the age span didn't know and between 12 and 30% of women were uncertain depending by age so it's not a small percentage interesting people it's you know a smaller large minority I don't know what you'd call that technically yeah that's interesting isn't it so the younger younger people had quite well-defined attitudes many small enough yes uncertain or certainly the women are yeah what you might think intuitively know that really interesting yes there's a bit of it's quite complicated stuff and you know it's hard to know what's it having an impact in Australia because we haven't had any clear policy change mm-hmm yeah but that's known to see it broken down both by gender and also by different ages and cohorts to try and understand these trends in the people yeah yeah well thank you and ooh that was absolutely fascinating presentation today and encourage any of you that have questions to please send them through and contact us today as well as access our upcoming and past webinars which are all recorded and available upon the kremps website under training and webinars are there you'll see the list of upcoming webinars and we would love to hear your feedback both on the session today so there'll be a short survey to complete we can give us some feedback and also suggest any topics that you might like to see for future webinars so I'd like to thank dr. Swift for her time today and thank you all thank yours they may very much thanks everybody have a great day"

MSzIYGWRXbE,What&#39;s all the buzz about CBD oil? | Just The FAQs,2019-08-16T15:09:51Z,"- [Narrator] You've probably already heard about cannabidiol,
better known as CBD. It's exploded in popularity with claims of treating everything
from insomnia to diabetes. - That's the only thing that would help me with my migraine headaches. - [Narrator] It can be consumed as an oil, applied to skin, or inhaled it as a vapor. We know CBD is a component of marijuana, but it's derived from hemp,
usually does not contain THC, and won't get you high. The game changer for the
CBD industry came when President Trump signed a farm bill legalizing hemp cultivation. One prescription drug
containing CBD has been approved for treating two rare forms
of childhood epilepsy, but the vast majority of
what we know about CBD has been limited to personal experiences and unproven animal studies. - More often than not, things
that look good in animals, when you go into humans,
those effects aren't there. - [Narrator] According to a
2018 Harvard Health Blog post, scientists say they still don't know much about how CBD affects the brain or which doses and
delivery methods work best. For example, if you put a few drops of CBD under your tongue, you
might consume 10 milligrams. But some researchers say you
would need 30 times that amount to reach a threshold
that can relieve stress. And since CBD products
are primarily marketed and sold as supplements, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration doesn't evaluate whether these products
are safe or effective. That means if you buy a CBD
product, you don't really know how much CBD is actually in the container. There's no denying the
CBD revolution is upon us and the marketplace is buying in. However, there's still
a lot of TBD about CBD."
zYFmmX2MxZQ,Can CBD OIL Help Relieve SCIATICA Pain? Here&#39;s the Answer.,2019-07-04T16:10:23Z,"Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from
SpineCare in St. Joseph, MI. In this video we’re going to ask: can CBD
Oil really help with relieving sciatica? Is it effective, and strong enough to actually
tackle the pain? Or is it all smoke and mirrors and too good
to be true? Let’s find out! Before we start, though, I want to say in
full disclosure that I’m not benefiting from or promoting any product or brand of
CBD oil. This video is just my personal thoughts on
the matter that I wanted to share. If you’ve ever suffered from sciatica, you
know how much of a nightmare it can be. It pretty much makes almost every daily activity
uncomfortable and inconvenient. For many suffers, they rely on over-the-counter
painkillers to make it through the day. And in more severe cases, pain management
through opioid pain medications, steroids, and injections may be prescribed. It’s no secret that the opioid epidemic
is real, and many people have reservations about taking something that has a high risk
of side-effects, including addiction. That’s why the appeal of CBD is growing,
since it offers the potential for effective pain relief on top of being natural, non-habit
forming, and having little to no side-effects. No doubt, CBD use is also growing steadily,
and is being used for treating conditions such as anxiety, insomnia, chronic pain, and
much more. So let’s take a look at how CBD may help
relieve sciatica pain, and start by going over what exactly CBD oil is and where it
comes from. CBD, or cannabidiol, is commonly known as
hemp oil. It is a form of cannabis, which includes the
well known marijuana plant. Cannabis contains a number of different compounds,
each with different effects on the body and mind. The two main active ingredients are Tetrahydrocannabinol,
or THC, and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is the part that produces the characteristic
‘high’ of marijuana, while CBD is associated with therapeutic qualities and is not psychoactive. Producers of CBD have developed cannabis strains
that have virtually no THC, primarily hemp plants. The oil produced from these hemp plants contain
less than 0.3% THC, which means it is not intoxicating and DOES NOT have any mind-altering
properties. Due to that, CBD oil is federally legal in
every state and does not require a prescription. I want to note, though, it is also not regulated
by the FDA and is considered a supplement. Next, let’s move on to some key aspects
of sciatica. If you’re unfamiliar with sciatica, especially
its causes and symptoms, and want to know more, I’m going to provide a link in this
video’s description to another video I’ve done that goes over it in more detail. So check it out after watching this video
to learn more. Sciatica is pain that travels, or radiates,
along the path of the sciatic nerve. This large nerve begins in your lower back
and forks into two (left and right) to travel from the buttocks, into the legs and feet. Sciatica has a couple main causes, with the
most common being a lumbar herniated disc that presses onto and pinches a nearby nerve. The other is due to spinal stenosis, which
is when the spinal canal (where the nerves travel through) narrow and close off, again
pinching nearby nerves. The sciatic nerve is very sensitive, and when
it becomes compressed or irritated by one of the reasons above, it may cause symptoms
like mild to debilitating pain, tingling, or numbness into the areas it travels. One of the things that makes sciatica pain
difficult to treat is that it is often a combination of two different kinds of pain, nociceptive
and neuropathic. Nociceptive pain is caused when nerves are
reacting to tissue damage, which sends signals to the central nervous system (your brain)
that something has gone wrong. Neuropathic pain is when the nerves themselves
are damaged, usually through compression causing inflammation and irritation. So what is it about CBD that makes it potentially
effective in taking on sciatica pain? It’s this: CBD stimulates a part of the
brain called the endocannabinoid system, a system responsible for communicating ""good
and bad signals"" throughout your body. When CBD stimulates this system, it can change
a bad signal to a good one, which may have the ability to alleviate both neuropathic
and nociceptive pain, as well as helping to reduce inflammation. Currently, though, studies on cannabis, including
both CBD and THC, are still in the early stages. I could not find one definitive study directly
linking CBD use and pain management of sciatica. However, the process in which CBD works is very
promising and could be an all-natural alternative to opioid drugs and other painkillers. I can say though, that CBD oil WILL NOT cure
any underlying issue causing sciatica, such as spinal stenosis or a herniated disc. So please do not take it as a substitute for
getting the proper care you need from a licensed healthcare professional! For those sciatica sufferers that have tried
CBD oil, please leave your experiences and results in the comments section below, all
of us would like to hear from you! Also, if you have any other comments or questions,
please feel free to leave them and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks for watching!"
vopMWewbkqw,Intro to Medical Marijuana,2019-12-20T15:37:25Z,all right hello everyone welcome I'm very happy to introduce to welcome you to the 19th annual Parkinson's symposium I know it said 18th in the flyer it's actually the 19th symposium the living well with Parkinson's disease beyond traditional medicines you know you may its if the speakers have 18th on their slides I just want to take responsibility for that my apologies the we we had actually a very large number of registrants this year more than we had in past years I don't know if that's because of the topics or just because we're growing year to year but I'm glad to see so much interest in this I'm I couldn't use myself I'm David Simon I'm the director of our Parkland Foundation Center of Excellence and chief of the division of movement disorders at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center a couple of just comments I want to make at the beginning one is if you have a cell phone please make sure the sound is off or the phone itself is off also I apologize for the conflict conflicting event across the street and the extra time it might have taken to come in I expect some people will be coming in late so for those of you where it would be easy to move in towards the middle to make it so people don't have to climb over you to get in when they arrive late that would be welcome it looks like there's still seats available so it should be fine we have a few people I want to just thank before we get started with our first speaker biggest thanks goes to Elizabeth Morrison and Althea silver Althea is in the back I don't see Elizabeth right now but you might have seen her at the table they did it thank you Joe they did a great job in a lot of work in making this symposium happen I also want to give a special thanks to some of our the people with Parkinson's who are going to participate in the demonstration of Rocksteady boxing a little later this morning also our sponsors Medtronic Abdi and patients like me who each have given donations to help support the cost of the symposium it still doesn't support the full cost of the symposium so if anybody else is interested in in donating we're very happy to offer this for free but it still does cost money and you're welcome to you can look at our website or kind Frank wicks dead from development I don't know if he's in the room right now but I would write in the back there or let me know and I can help you one other thing I want to mention there's actually an opportunity it was in our last newsletter for those of you on our email list and if you're not on our email list you can give your email to LC or Elizabeth today and get periodic emails about events like this we also have a bib available for the upcoming next year's Boston Marathon if anybody is interested in running in the marathon to help generate support for our research and Parkinson's support programs so let me know if you're anybody is interested or if you know somebody who's interested also we have quite a few wellness works programs which is very relevant to the theme today in terms of you know complementary ways to help support your Parkinson's disease treatment I think as Kyle here in the audience and Stacy right here are instrumental in our wellness works programs you can let her know if you have any questions or again you can let me know and there's an again information on our website about these programs also want to so we have programs that we run here we also run some through a collaboration with JCC I want to thank Audrey for that and also Althea again and also the Parkinson foundation which provides funding to help support that collaborative effort you know new event this year is our lunch with research scientists who are doing research on Parkinson's disease or early stages in their career and we're gonna have a lunch afterwards only for those of you who registered in advance for Ed we were only able to do that this time for a hundred people so it filled up quickly because most people who registered for this event also signed up for the lunch so I apologize for those of you who might have wanted to join that lunch afterwards but we have to restrict it to those who registered in advance and I think with that I will it's yeah I think that's oh yeah one last thing before we move on to introducing our speaker we're gonna hold questions not we're not gonna have questions during the talk at the end of the talk even though this program said we're going to have both dr. levy and dr. Ellis talk first and then questions actually going to shift that a little bit and we'll take questions for dr. levy after his talk and my apologist again in the program it's Donald levy not Dan levy but we'll take questions after his talk but rather than have people step up to the mic what we found worked for us in the past years was we're gonna hand out note cards and anybody during the talk and write down a question on the note card and then we'll collect them and most likely unfortunately only be have time to answer a you know a subset of the questions that are asked but they'll give us a chance to to choose some that especially those that we see multiple people asking so hopefully you'll get those note cards shortly so again I'm very happy to introduce dr. Donald levy he's an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and medical director of the osher Center for Integrative Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital he's taught harvard medical students interns residents and fellow physicians in a variety of settings over 35 years and maintained a practice in primary care internal medicine until 2007 when he gave when he became director of the osher center he's a recipient of numerous awards for excellence in teaching and citations for excellence in patient care and patient satisfaction and his current professional interests include integrating the scientific advances in modern medicine with age-old therapies and principles of healing and the use of therapeutic lifestyle changes including nutrition and dietary habits and herbal supplements to recover from illness and maintain good health and also the power of an effective doctor-patient relationship in medical care he lectures often on these topics and sees patients in consultation for an integrative medicine approach to the management of medical problems and I'm very happy to welcome him today [Applause] [Music] can you hear come hear me I stay away from this I like to be able to wander thank you for having me I'm honored to be here I'm going to talk to you a little bit about medical marijuana make a distinction between recreational use and medical use you could hear him right so you're gonna be able to hear me I hope yes all right you don't appear to be shy so speak up if you can't hear me we've learned how to use this sorry I'm obviously learning okay I'll go this way I need help thank you oh that one okay sorry okay so what I was saying is that it's a very interesting history that marijuana began as a method medicinal became recreational and now we're back to medicinal I'd love to give you some basic theory and understanding in medical marijuana and not get into all the absolute research and the moral and immoral and all the implications of legalizing it but give you information to help you understand it and if you don't think marijuana is available recreationally somebody was getting out of their car in p-town and this that's the kerb on the left and growing right there was some I guess recreational marijuana it is probably the most commonly used substance of this sort in the United States and I guess we're up to almost half of us have admitted over our lifetime to have tried it what's really interesting is this with all of the controversy about it there's almost no life threatening toxicity that don't think there's a recorded case anywhere of somebody dying of an overdose of just marijuana so with all the issues and ills and worries you're probably not going to kill yourself if you play around with medical marijuana I do worry tremendously about the use of marijuana for adolescents because the developing brain may not be the best place to expose marijuana there is addiction syndromes you can get addicted almost most of the folks that get addicted to marijuana our kids who started in teenage years and use it for recreational use I have I don't think there's data to suggest how many people get addicted who begin for medicinal uses and there isn't withdrawal syndrome which makes it medically valid to talk about addiction marijuana is very interesting because you can grow it in two different ways the cannabis species you can grow it as you know hemp hemp been around forever and it's used as a rope same species if you cut off the the flowering buds at the right time you get a whole different you get a different product and very different obviously and their outcomes here's some of the differences I'm not a botanist cannabis they're both cannabis species hemp as are those tall stalks you just saw in what we generally referred to as marijuana there are these leafy parts with trichomes and buds and flowers that these glandular parts have all the active ingredients and if you harvest a plant like this before all that happens you end up getting something like hemp the one on the Left met what we it's generally what we call marijuana but hemp is also a cannabis plant marijuana is high in THC and hemp is high in CBD and if you don't know what those are you will in a minute I promise here's on the left that the leaves with the trichomes and then on the right the trichomes are a hundred thousand times magnified that's where all the active ingredients in marijuana most of them reside it's good to know the recreational terms because whether you use it or your kids use it or a friend uses it or someone refers to it I do come from the 60s and yes I used hashish it was lit it was about as potent as a normal marijuana cigarette today we're a very different time we're living in and I'll tell you more about that it's that resin all pushed together and then if you take the resin and put a solvent and dry it out you get this stuff called kief which is remarkably potent in that thing called THC hash oil or honey or dab or wax or butter bu d de r is important to know about only because it's remarkably potent remarkably potent and people call it dabbing when they take a little bit of that I'll show it to you it's on the right there honey oil or dab and a little dab will do you it's it's remarkably potent and that's right what assume kids easily can get addicted because you dab and then your dad began in an hour and an hour and it looks pretty innocent there looks like candy if you took that whole thing you would you'd be on quite a trip you went it wouldn't be enjoyable so let's talk about there sativa and indica - the most well-known species or subspecies of marijuana they're beginning to blend together so much that I don't know if we'll even make this distinction anymore down the road but people who are who are veterans will tell you they need an indica plant they need a certain particular one here's an interesting comparison recreationally there's a gazillion people I guess using twenty two million using marijuana but medicinally probably 1/10 or less and here's the interesting thing well you know if you're using marijuana for recreational purposes its - its to alter your mood whereas for people who are ill with any kind of chronic illness it's to help them feel better or relieve some symptom very big difference in intention and in the first one your cognitive function is impaired because you want it to be you want to get high people who are ill who are using medical marijuana are doing it because it's an adjunct to their treatment and they want to feel better and function better and they actually their cognitive status actually can improve for example if you use it to sleep and you sleep better you're going to feel better and think better and the effect on opiate use is another fascinating thing there's actually a reduction a reduction in lethal opioid overdoses in places where marijuana has been legal I might talk on that if we have time in a few minutes medical use let me give you the five thousand year history in 30 seconds there was this Empress Shenyang 2700 BC who got sick of his shaman's shamans who couldn't get anything done people were complaining they still had a lot of ailments he discovered that marijuana was fantastic for a whole bunch of things in marijuana tea of course back then all these things listed and he gave it out and had great results reported by him skip ahead a couple of thousand years in the 1850s it was if I had a medical bag it was in it it was very well used by doctors and in 1937 for all kinds of political issues it got banned that the AMA wrote a letter to Congress which is in the Congressional Record saying don't ban marijuana we wanted bag but that was was not listened to and then states took it on themselves to legalize marijuana and we're in a kind of messy legal position right now all over the country famous physicians Sir William Osler is the God one of the gods of medicine said it's one of the best things for migraine and Morris Fishbein who was general the American Medical Medical Journal American Medical Association editor wrote about it fermentable migraine if there's literature loaded with the value of medical marijuana disappeared after the 1930s and if you know about scheduled drugs that this is the craziness schedule one drugs which marijuana is is our drugs such as heroin LSD ecstasy peyote some of those silly to be Schedule one drug probably heroin belongs there for sure but to put marijuana in that category silly and I bring it up only because if we want to learn more about it and have people like you or me or anyone use it for a medical condition it's hard to research it it's hard to get it and it's so dangerous to try to work with it legally that we can't get anywhere this past year I think finally the DEA said we're not going to change its status but entities so I guess Harvard Medical School or a place that does research can apply and start doing research with it so I think things are going to change but it's really important I think that it becomes scheduled appropriately it is not a lethal drug or as dangerous as heroin okay the pharmacology when you leave here I hope you know the basic pharmacology of marijuana they're the two big cannabinoids THC CB and CBD THC is always considered the most active but it isn't it's just the one that makes you high gives you quite a hallucinogenic and high enough doses trip cannabidiol different effect it actually calms you can reduce anxiety can reverse some of the problems that THC gives you it's got anti-inflammatory properties and other things what really made this take off and start to have research in the 90s is that they discovered we have marijuana receptors this happened with opiates when we discovered you talk about your endorphins get getting boosted when you run or something like that doesn't those are morphine receptors technically or opioid receptors once they discovered endogenous within us marijuana receptors are cb1 and cb2 this became a fabulous area for research what can we do with this stuff why do we have receptors within us how can we use it to our advantage and the cb1 are mostly in the central nervous system and the cb2 are mostly unconnected with the immune system and I think the reason nobody dies from a terrible overdose of marijuana is just what I wrote there in red that there's no cp1 or cb2 receptors in the brain stem which is where it controls breathing when someone overdoses with an opiate they often die because they stop breathing that doesn't happen with marijuana I don't know if that's good or bad well I think it's good that nobody hurt themselves but it's just an interesting fact and lucky for people who are playing around with it this is another picture of that system that's on the top and these are two nerve endings meeting and there's receptors to study and we can we use marijuana for the pre presynaptic and postsynaptic receptor tons of research now if of cannabinoids and the endogenous system and then of course that what follows as drug companies getting the act and make synthetic versions of marijuana and sell them as medications and some of you might have been on Marinol in your lives the one that's really interesting to me is sativex but it's not available yet in this country it didn't pass some tests the criteria was silly it's all it's available in Canada and all over the world but it's the closest thing to a tincture of pure marijuana with a one to one ratio of THC and CBD that's not the only ratio that's best but we're getting closer to a legal clean prescribe 'el version of marijuana and stranger that's not a Schedule one drug the system doesn't make sense and then there's FBA dole X which was if you ever saw as Sanjay Gupta's on TV the terrible seizure disorder and children that was it was healed by CBD that's almost pure hemp oil or pure CBD that has been now made to a patented medicine here they are on the left is the Sativex which I hope becomes legal in this country and for those poor kids who have this terrible seizure disorder there is now a medication they can legally get here's the issue to me pharmaceuticals I do integrative medicine and you do a lot of prescribing of herbal supplements and supplements are different than pharmaceuticals I call them nutriceuticals the whole plant works differently than a sub part for example what I had here like marinol it's a synthetic part it's a synthetic derivative of one part of marijuana it's nothing like the whole plant so most of the research that's been done has been on these sub parts synthetically manufactured and sold pharmaceutically but patients will tell me there's a real difference when I smoke marijuana total difference what is that all about well here's some more pharmacology I told you about THC and CBD tetrahydrocannabinol cannabidiol those are the big two then there's a good four more this will get you crazy there's kind of bigger all kind of been all counted by chroming I loved the last week hetra Hydra counter by Byron they're all different though they're each being studied at McLean hospital right now or some of them are the last one might have anti psychotic features some have anti-inflammatory some of it might be useful for movement disorders and then there's more here there's 60 others there's 60 other cannabinoids in marijuana and then even hotter topic for research or terpenoids if anybody's walking around and they smell something and they think that's marijuana it's the terpenoids in marijuana that smell like that distinctive odor or fragrance depending on what you think so all of this together is not the same as extracting one part and putting it into a pill big issue so I will raise this for you which I raise for doctors when we talk our herbal preparations just messy drugs we were taught in medical school it's so against our teaching to not just to think of an herbal preparation get the active ingredient out usually we learned about some drug or plant from those savages of some place somewhere in the jungle or perhaps Native Americans in a you know condescending way and we want to take out what the active ingredient is and it turns out they knew better they knew that the whole plant was more helpful and and easier to use so pharmaceuticals we know about you take out the active ingredient it's identifiable herbal extracts 92 things going on too messy don't want to do it on the other hand there are people now starting all over the world saying there's a thing called the entourage effect that is when multiple parts of a plant have synergistic activity it might be better than any single one part so for example THC is the psychoactive part that gets you really high and maybe anxious and nervous and paranoid as well and it but it seems to activate people who ever using any kind of marijuana CBD goes the other way and calms you down so those two together what a little on the other sixty things in there are a good combination so to separate them out you're actually doing something silly and think it's in the name of progress and science there's a lot of good reasons to keep the whole entourage together I always use the example well when the Celtics were winning championships Larry Bird he was the active ingredient on the team maybe but he needed four other players or he would not have won or Michael Jordan or wherever you live an entourage is like that maybe that's what's needed in medical nutraceuticals and in fact there was a congress in europe that came out with this discussion and said attempts to isolate the active principles from plant extracts may be ultimately self-defeating the quote Silver Bullet concept adopted by Orthodox Doc's for the last hundred years you can read it it's now increasingly viewed as inadequate and I think that's an important issue and marijuana is really important to demonstrate that issue we're not looking for the Silver Bullet we have to learn how to use the whole plant and that is messy but unfortunately it's or fortunately there's something to be learned there so for example one more point about this of the other big six cannabinoids CBC that kind of bigger kind of been on kind of kind of banal or can a bigger role or tetrahedra can have by Virant they're all different they all have different components different and different efficacies and different applications and maybe they all need to go together or we need to figure out the right mix so keep that in mind when you read literature if they use the synthetic single part it may not apply to you at all here are some of the things that some of the the cannabis components are known for all these things are really important and we again we need to learn how to balance them and why I'm really interested in research on the whole plant hope hope products from if you add up and look through anecdotes case series clinical animal studies you will find at least these same indications coming up over and over again and same from people who've had personal experience if you have marijuana you get the munchies you get hungry generally you don't throw up if you're having chemotherapy it's an analgesic it helps reduce anxiety and can help people sleep its antispasmodic so for people with MS especially it's been very helpful and it's anti-inflammatory which is fascinating and needs to be explored further so the hike there are some high-quality studies but most of them as I look back in the literature most of them are synthetic THC some of them are THC put CBD like that oral spray sativex or in a Bick so malls fewer studies use the whole cannabis plant there's a great couple of references here and I can get them to anybody or through david about how this is how this all plays out but again really important to look in a study of people tell you the literature is and isn't satisfactory it isn't satisfactory because we're not studying the whole product so now I'll give you a little bit about cannabis back when I came of age in the 60s if you bought a joint maybe it had 1 or 2% marijuana THC maybe if you smoked hashish it had 6 7 or 8% now that won't even qualify as a cigarette the the stuff that's out now 13% 15% that 30% this is very potent this is like you knowing I can have one mixed drink with an ounce and a half of gin and suddenly there's 13 ounces in it that's a very different drink very different drink so to compare old and new marijuana it's very important to know something about the dose and which what you're getting a very important reason to be able to go to a dispensary and have it labeled probably the best way to get it is to vaporize it if you're going to think about the ways to get marijuana into you and now every one of those including rectal suppositories have been used most people probably smoked it oral or edibles is becoming more popular I'll tell you about the different ways it's used if you inhale it or smoke it you're going to get a serum peak within a few minutes eight minutes so one bit of advice that I've given people is that if that's how you're doing it I'm just jumping into now practical stuff if you're trying to figure out if marijuana is helpful to you take a puff and wait 8 minutes and don't take another puff for a while give it a little bit of time to see what happened if you are taking it orally you're gonna have to find out in you on an empty stomach or a full stomach how long it takes most people it's somewhere between 30 and 30 minutes and an hour and a half and once they know it's very helpful and very useful so I tell people between bites of whatever they're there they're eating wait a half an hour wait an hour and see what's happening I do not think it's funny when people give people something that has and inedible just for a joke it's not a funny joke because often people an hour later at home and freaking out because I don't know what they've been given it used to be considered amusing I don't think so at all I think you got to be very careful if you haven't had a bowl find out how it works for you and then you can experiment a little vaporizing is probably the one way used in a lot of medical experiments you're basically heating it in something and the portable ones are like the old cigarette lighters in a car or something that heats something up but just short of burning it and then you can it becomes a vapor and you can you can inhale it here's the big one that was used it's called the volcano it's because of that volcano looking device in the middle you can actually set the temperature then you put that bag on the top the bag looks inflated there it's usually collapsed you put the bed on the top you heat up the marijuana the bag fills up like a popcorn like you didn't have popcorn then you put that black plug take it off and you can put it aside for the day and you can absolutely meter your doses you can also have it for your own use if this is being used medically for experimental studies that's a good way to get a somewhat scientific to say if they took six inhalations or twelve and they knew exactly what they were giving people still by the volcano but nowadays almost everybody is using some kind of pen like device to vaporize it this one looks like on the left there's that's vapor not smoke if it's if it's being done properly so you don't get all of the noxious materials from smoke I don't recommend that anybody smoke anything so vaporizing makes the most sense to me medically or trying something in an edible fashion it scares me though edibles scare me because they look too much especially when the free market they look like candies we have no idea what's in them unless you're getting at a dispensary and all the issues of absorption and delayed onset of action and the next slide is shocking to me this is the the DEA confiscated some candies and look at these we've got Keef cat we've got Buddha fingers munch away all these cute little names for candy bars that look quite similar to two you know well-known candy bars and I think that's crazy and dangerous and probably should be made illegal and that somehow as we learn how to regulate this substance and not throw the baby out with the bathwater we learned how to make edibles in a fashion that looks something medical perhaps or something easily identifiable and also able to break into doses this was this was I've seen more and more of this I don't know what's going to happen when it gets fully recreational illegal but this is one of the things that scares me I think the stuff that I studied the most originally because patients came to me and taught me this is that it helped them with their chronic pain and some studies have shown that this was surprising to me the studies the kind of studies that are rats you'll look back on retrospective study asking people how they used it and getting some really deep dive into their use of marijuana this first study was 244 people who were taking it for chronic pain and they said the same thing that I hear personally anecdotally and seeing other studies like the second one was from Australia first of all what's interesting is I thought marijuana would work best for fibromyalgia patients because it would do something centrally amplified pain and it didn't it actually worked better for neuropathic pain the second thing is everybody found their own dose but the most important thing was it became an exit drug not an entrance drug for opioids many many people report I used to take ten of X you know opioid I'm on five now and it's fabulous and again it gets back to the difference between recreational and medical use I assume everyone here if you are going to try it or use it or have it prescribed it's going to be for medical use and you're using it because you want to improve some part of your life and so people tell me now I could be with my family at Thanksgiving I used to be a zombie when I took enough pain twisters pain relief now or now I can sleep or now there's other things unless anxious and I don't need as much of the opioids so just for control it's very interesting what marijuana is done in fact they did a really deep dive pretend the first the 10 years from 2000 to 2010 and in there was in any state where marijuana became legal there was a drop in opioid overdose deaths and this is a strong association that continues to this day so it's interesting when I hear all this stuff about it it's an entrance drug it might be for kids and we have to be careful that but for people using it not recreationally but medically it's actually an exit drug from opioids I think it can help the opioid epidemic so I looked a little bit cannabis in Parkinson's disease it's really hard to find as in every area not as much evidence or studies as with neuropathic pain I think but there is some interesting things that if I was a researcher I'd want to follow up how does it in any way affect motor activity it looks like right now the best things I see are the non motor problems in Parkinson's especially sleep and anxiety I don't know about depression or pain pain for sure if because of my other experiences with marijuana use for people with chronic pain whether it's going to have neuroprotective effects and in any way change progression long way to go on that one and of course every paper written anywhere says we need to standardize it and get more evidence about its safety and efficacy ensure that's fine but it's going to happen it's gonna happen a little bit haphazardly because there are now it's going to become legal and people in this audience and anyone else are going to start experimenting themselves to see what works for them one one good article if you looked up one article to look about to read about medical marijuana this the article by Savage and the Journal of pain I could give that out to you for a it's sort of a consensus document looking at all the things the issues regarding marijuana a few more slides because they'll have time for questions what's fascinating is when they when they became legal in Massachusetts cancer about common AIDS right away became a okay for as a reason to have marijuana prescribed and then the list changes in each state Hep C is is on the list here but not in Colorado Parkinson's disease is on the list in Massachusetts but look in Colorado Parkinson's disease isn't even mentioned that's strange we're all we're all I call it the Braille the Braille method stolen from a guy named Levine who was we're all sort of reaching trying to figure out how to do this actually we do that more often than you think in science and then we hit a discovery and make it sound like oh yeah we knew that was coming but it isn't true but we're all trying to reach and figure out and that's why I think there's another really fascinating thing going on with marijuana that has to do with the patient-doctor relationship which I'll say more about in a moment at this point I think when when doctors suggest that someone go get a medical card it would be for these reasons nausea and vomiting especially chemotherapy related that's pretty high on the list now chronic neuropathic pain yes it will reduce may as the possibility of reducing your need for opioids anyone who's losing weight from it from a condition might be helped by marijuana people with MS or reporting a benefit with the spasticity and then down the list a couple of more I'm seeing more and more people tell me about insomnia that they don't like sleeping pills and this has been one of the when they found the right dose this was a way to get a good night's sleep and everyone will tell you a good night's sleep is helpful for any condition you have including just enjoying life so I think this is one of my last slides a lot of everybody will cite all the problems by the way the first problem to me is that we can't research it enough it's still a Schedule one drug and hopefully that's changing yes the rigorous trials are not going to happen until we get people who if David wanted to research it he could do it here without jumping through 52 hoops yes we need to know the composition and the purity and the concentration again need people being able to give us this information there's no clear optimal dose for various conditions and this next one it's unconventional it's unconventional because guess why patients are in charge more than the doctor and to me that is the future of medicine I think patients should be equal partners where I I have expertise I went to this thing called medical school and I've been reading for the last 35 years but I don't know you better than you and you know how to how your body works and you know what you've done and and you can be an equal partner and it'll never happen more than in the use of medical marijuana because there's just not allowed a lot of information out there so you will go to a dispensary if you got the card and decided it was an appropriate thing and we're gonna work together then and talk because I don't know how it's going to work for you I can just give you this kind of advice and you're gonna lead be patients are going to lead I think which will be wonderful for a restructuring of patient doctor relationships for chronic disease in general it's it's what could be a benefit although here it's considered a terrible thing doctors have to give up the power of writing the prescription you will take this drug at this dose three times a day like I said and don't don't deviate and let me know that's just not going to work it doesn't work anyway but if you surveys of people taking prescribed medicines some of them are found in the trash on the way out the clinic door because nobody listens to the person enough to know that they already had that drug and it caused the problem that's our problem in connecting with our patients yes there's some side effects yes there are some neurocognitive changes and we need to know more about that I'm especially worried about the neurocognitive changes for recreational use not medical and young people this cannabis use disorder is real for young people and people who think you may activate the opioid overdose I think every bit of literature so far shows that to be not true so what I've tried to say so far is a few things medical versus recreational you got to ask that question every you hear a study or a person talking about it you're talking about medical or recreational use because two different populations exists there the biochemistry learn about it when you can think about the entourage effect and that a whole plant is perhaps more effective not less effective than a pharmaceutical Silver Bullet extract I've told you about some of the formulations but edible and vaporize to the I think two of the preferred ways to take it if you're ever going to experiment some of the things that it can definitely do when others we just need to research I think I'm done and we can talk there's time right yeah thank you very much there was we've got quite a few questions here and as I mentioned I won't be able to get to them all but I'll just do a couple of them actually one of them I think is a sign that you seem to have expressed interest in some of the potential uses one person asked where they can get seeds to grow marijuana and it does just actually lead me to just feel obligated to make one point here which is that you know as a physician I don't endorse the use of marijuana for Parkinson's disease but I recognize that some patients use it and and I think it's important to have information to make decisions like that which is why I'm glad we have an expert like Dunleavy here to talk to us about it I don't know if you want to actually answer that question whether what about it - I I don't know how to grow it so I I have no idea what to say about seeds I think as it becomes recreationally legal it's going to happen anyway right so again this is just cascading forward without us even having a chance to comment I'm not against that but I would sure like a manual of what to do and how to use it but that's all I can say one question relates to the studies that have been done how often and how many of the indications are there placebo-controlled studies plus Evo effect is particularly important in Parkinson's disease where expectation of reward causes dopamine release so people really do get better if they think something's going to help so how can you tell that's what's going on or if it's a more you know biological effect of of the drug there are not enough studies with placebo groups mostly retrospective asking people what happened kind of studies and then there are some with that bag when you think you can you can get something different different strengths but again if it becomes legitimate to research it if you could get ahold of somewhere it's somebody on your team that loved to do this will get much better studies that's a major criticism and I great we just don't know so we're relying on retrospective studies where the placebo you know that expectation I'm going to take this stuff I'm going to feel better and you will feel better even if I gave you a salty vapor to inhale another question relates to cognitive problems so some some part not all but some Parkinson's patients have a significant cognitive troubles and is that a concern in terms of a risk for you for using these agents I think for me there is some literature going on that with cognitive function in general some really interesting ones you ever heard of this group test that's where you they have the word like blue but but you're supposed to say the color of the word white because the word is and I had this test I didn't show it to you that the word the word blue is written in white letters and you're supposed to actually say white not blue if you mind it's a way to test how you can keep yourself focused so they're doing a lot of studies of cognitive function and in general with marijuana so to me if you were worried about this I would get neuropsych testing which I'm sure is available before and then use that as a baseline because I think it's difficult for you to judge that and it's this is a legitimate thing to say I want to use this I'm not sure I think Dad mom my friend myself are getting confused using marijuana it might be messing me up of course you got to look at the dose and what you're doing but might not get a battery of neuropsych tests and then see what happens when you start using marijuana so you have a baseline that's my recommendation to people again we have to struggle with these kind of recommendations because there's no there's no guidelines for any of us in this field as physicians of how to use a substance that we don't prescribe fact it's technically illegal for us to it a couple of questions related to sleep and what's the data on it is a sleep aid and also what aspects of sleep there's Parkinson's disease patients have various types of sleep disorders sometimes insomnia difficulty getting to sleep sometimes REM behavior disorder where people act out their dreams sometimes periodic limb movements of sleep there's various types so what's known about I again I don't know the date on each of these things as well a lot of it I get from patients it seems like I ask patients my simple questions how is your sleep do you have vivid and wild dreams etc a few questions and the general thing is when they found the right dose and the right product they just sleep better that's that's a crude answer that's a great study though commit it's so easy to do in a sleep lab if it became legal to do it you know how to put people in the sleep lab and study what's going on maybe we can make recommendations then that know you're on the wrong product that's why you're so you're having vivid dreams or going bananas or it's keeping you up or it's leaving you hungover so here's a question relevant to something I've said which is that I don't specifically endorse this so I don't prescribe it for anybody but some people are actually asking well if my physician doesn't prescribe it what what should I do you know how you know who is prescribing it yeah I guess what you you end up getting folks and I've stayed away from this of certifying people for the marijuana card because everybody told me my clinical become the weed clinic and we like to do other things and I don't want to be inundated I know are the partners MS center some people are now sort of are certifying people for specific reasons so I say to people we're gonna have to do this together you me your primary care doc your neurologist you can go to a place to a doc that'll certify you you'll get that card you'll go into a dispensary and you'll be shocked that there's all kinds of young people telling you what might and might not work for you what happened to the people in white coats and labs and science you're going to be given a possible product to try and I think it's that kind of power to patients is disconcerting to doctors and a little worrisome but think it can work out because I have found again if it's medicinal use not recreational medicinal use people are pretty responsible if anything they're skeptical if anything they don't want another drug and they've had enough drugs and they've had enough experiences medically so we have to stand back and just coach and you have to say to them I don't think this is where can I just did it the way you walk down the hall doesn't look good what are you doing you need to stay in touch with your neurologist your primary care doctor who's ever helping you it's messy it's very messy right now but I think it's doable and it's the only way we have now custom for me to say don't wait until we get every one of these issues completely satisfied it's going to be a long time I actually think people I'm looking forward to the medicinal crowd helping us the recreational crowds all over the place they're trying to get high the kids are there other people and that's not going to help us learn as much as we need to learn there's a lot of other questions but I think just because of time or we've already allowed the questions to go a little beyond what we needed I think we're gonna have to stop there I'm sorry for those of you who had other questions that we're not gonna be able to get to right now again thank you very much for taking the time to talk with us today [Applause]

jr2wofLViwc,The Highs and Lows of Medical Cannabis,2019-02-26T12:18:01Z,as far as the mic goes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hello and welcome everyone today's were welcome you to today's webinar it's a high time to talk about the medical uses of cannabinoids and today we're very lucky to have two wonderful guests dr. malkin and dr. mark we're and both are extremely well known in their field probably the two lead people in Canada around the medical uses of cannabinoids so we're very fortunate to have them both with us they come from different viewpoints which we'll hear throughout today's discussion we framed it as kind of a panel discussion if you will and before we spend any more time on that I want to jump to our conflicts of interest so we can get the get the program moving quickly so first well first of all you probably wonder what am I using these big headphones for am I trying to sell a trip to Disneyland or something with these Mickey Mouse ears but where we're all in different locations today and so we're using we're going by Skype and that's why I'm using the headphones so but I'm Mike Allen I'm a family doctor and the director of program and practice support here at the national college and I have no commercial conflicts of interests related to this topic I haven't taken anything from industry since 1998 when I went out to a drug dinner I do have a potential conflict of interest in what we call predisposition biased or academic vison that I have written articles on medical cannabinoids so I get my pay from the College of Family Physicians of Canada and the University of Alberta and I've gotten grants and speaking fees and honorarium from a variety of nonprofit sources like the college to word optimize practice the Alberta Medical Association etc okay and next we'll have mark to just quickly go over his conflicts of interest mark thank you my kin good afternoon everyone thanks for hosting this very important discussion my conflicts are horribly and as conflicted as it's possible to get on July 1st to 90 year 2018 I canapé growth as chief medical officer so I am employed by a licensed cannabis producer I have salary and stock options in the company prior to that I was a family physician with an interest in pain management working at McGill University and the McGill University Health Centre I had received grants from industry to conduct clinical trials at the time of my transition to industry I disclosed these and I stepped away from those grants so my I currently received no additional funding from any other source I am now exclusively on leave of absence from McGill to fulfill my role at the company Thank You Marc and Mel over to you who's here in Toronto but at a different location so no yeah thank you I have no conflicts of interest that are directly relevant to cannabis I have been involved in the addiction field for a long time and I'm currently conducting research and program development in that area and currently employed by Women's College Hospital and the University of Toronto Department of Family Medicine thank you very much okay guys we're gonna move forward and talk just really briefly remind everyone listening that there are objectives for this the first is to summarize the challenges you should be able to do that at the end of this you should also with your own practice experience apply some of these discussion points and kind of bring that into your interaction with patients about their eligibility and appropriateness for medical cannabinoids now just a reminder so we've we've introduced ourselves a bit a bit of housekeeping this is this webinar is not going to be certified but you're be welcome to view it after in a recorded format and during the webinar we will be asking you questions and you will see on the YouTube channel in the discussion or chat portion of it that there will be a poll everywhere linked so you can participate in kind of completing the polls and also it'll be your mechanisms by which you can submit questions to us as we go and we welcome questions as we're going and I'll try and integrate those at different stages of the presentation so what we're going to do is each of our participants will describe a little bit of their background and related to medical cannabinoids and discuss their position on medical cannabinoids then we'll break down into kind of four questions that each one will have around four minutes to address and the first one is around pain management the next one is around conditions that have less adequate evidence and we'll have the panelists kind of discussed the challenges there and their recommended approaches and then we'll talk about one of the things that's become of large interest to us is of course this oh the opioid epidemic and how are we managing the challenges with opioid use disorder and overdoses and deaths and cannabis has been proposed as one of the potential interventions that can help us in managing this and I'll have the panelists discuss that and then last but not least we'll actually talk about cannabis use disorder to an extent and then we'll finish off with some poll questions as I mentioned all the way through we'll try and integrate some of your questions so please feel free to forward questions right after the first poll everywhere question so this is our our poll everywhere a question we'd love you to participate and the first the first statement is I am comfortable authorizing cannabis for conditions with little or no RCT evidence like depression and for conditions with reasonable evidence like neuropathic pain the next option is I am comfortable authorizing cannabis for conditions with reasonable evidence like neuropathic pain only and what I mean only there we're talking about only those where the evidence is stronger I'm not comfortable authorizing cannabis but have done under rare circumstances and the last one is I will not authorize medical cannabis so if you can take your time to look through the survey see where you would kind of put yourself that would be greatly appreciated we know there's a bit of a lag between where this comes out I proposed this question and sought feedback from mark and Mel from my experience when speaking on medical cannabinoids we get a lot of I get quite polarized view from everything from kind of an almost certainty that we can never prescribe medical cannabinoids all the way to doing so with very little evidence or evidence mostly around anecdotal reports and these reports looks like we're having a tiny bit of trouble with the poll everywhere so ok so we're gonna press through on the unfortunately we didn't get to that but I want you will be will be coming back to that question in another format this area of the poll everywhere now is available for you to begin to put your questions and I will sift through those and feed them back to the participants ok so before we get into the discussion points what I'd like us to do is try and address just a general approach to your thoughts around medical cannabinoids for about four to five minutes and we'll ask each of the panelists to do that so mark why don't you start for four to five minutes just give your background in the in the area of medical cannabinoids and where you think their utility is and where where there's where their strengths are and where their weaknesses are sure Mike thank you so perhaps by way of background I worked at the McGill University Health Centre pain clinic since 1999 and gradually worked my way through the academic ladder studying medical cannabis as a treatment option for patients with chronic pain mostly non-cancer pain and this was initiated because as many family physicians and other specialists will recognize patients are coming in asking about it and I realized 20 years ago that there was very limited evidence on which to base decisions so I began applying for funding and developing research programs to look both at the safety and efficacy of cannabis but less in the pharmaceutical form and more indeed dried cannabis medical cannabis I think is important to start to differentiate that the purpose of this discussion is about the medical use of cannabinoids which of course implies that we're working on the active ingredients or the chemicals in cannabis which are most believed to have some therapeutic activity in the time that I was studying this work the available funding was for dried cannabis early 2004 Sundays were being studied both cannabis if that was a major mechanism by which people were using cannabis so our first problem agencies and City quit is they think so the research line was very clearly focused on particular modes of administration and on on particular patient populations of course as time went on it became clear that patients were using cannabis for a lot of other pain conditions for arthritic conditions for generalized pain syndromes like fibromyalgia and we began exploring as much as we could use of different cannabinoid compounds like NAB alone and other compounds to see whether there was a chance that these compounds could add some value to the therapeutic strategy of pain management I think it's important to point out that at no time do I think or suggest that cannabis or cannabinoids are a standalone cure-all for a chronic pain the reality is that most physicians who see patients with chronic pain will realize that the right approach is a convent pharmacotherapy physical therapy or physiotherapy and the psychotherapy approach it's a complex disorder with Hey beautiful mark you're cracking up there a bit so I'm just gonna see if the team has a is it a problem or is a okay mark I'm gonna give you there and I'm just gonna go to Mel I'm sorry about that but we really we lost a bit of what you were saying and I don't want to miss that so I'm gonna give a chance for a Skype to kind of catch up Mel can you do you want to wage in now to your kind of background and and your history and where you think the strengths and weaknesses are of cannabis and as a as a medical treatment sure I've been a doctor for many years well over thirty years and I was involved in the 2014 college of Family Physicians from preliminary guidance document on the prescribing of bright cannabis I come to this from a very different view than doctor where I was right at the beginning of the opioid epidemic and I think to a large extent the opioid epidemic was what you might call a Pharma epidemic that is to say a pharmaceutical company was aggressively marketing their product oxycontin it's profound and change physician prescribing opiates and the resulted in great harm and I'm seeing some parallels now with the aggressive marketing of cannabis or conditions for which it's not indicated and it's not safe and legalization is going to compound that now to where the cannabis does not cause you know thousands of opiate overdose deaths or anything but let's be clear well really cause serious harm to many people if it's used inappropriately and it I go TSA's so my message to position into this first of all to have realized as Mark said their brightness is completely different than the pharmaceutical cannabinoid confirms that profile and also in this book and the companies are mainly marketing live cannabis and if this product of fun emphasize the gift first of all people continue to smoke cannabis that's their primary way of taking it that is a very unsafe delivery system it reaches the brain within seconds causing cognitive impairment potentially and causing a euphoric effect smoke creates many dangerous chemicals and products including after agents and carcinogens when Knab alone and sativex Ornette vixen malls the two main pharmaceutical cannabinoids are legal and they're pure and they have a much smoother distribution and they're much less likely to cause harm in fact there's also much better evidence of benefit for thrown at pain for example a systematic review found that there were ten RCTs on the pixel malls for chronic neuropathic pain there were three RCPS on oral cannabinoids such as NAV alone and only two are some keys on dried cannabis so I want to emphasize that always the pharmaceutical cannabinoids should be first-line and should be given a therapeutic trial okay earth are we losing melting in your beam just now we didn't know so we lost you for about a half a minute there okay so I was just trying to say that cannabis is very different in terms of safety and effectiveness than pharmaceutical cannabinoids and punch it out these bogus Navajos out of it second point is to be very careful of describing product by THC the comforts are producing and marketing product that between extraordinary high amounts of THC 20% or more these are on safe there's no evidence the benefit for them and the harms of anibus are mainly related to THC and more potent the greater the hearts and these harms include motor vehicle accident psychosis addiction anxiety and so on so if you are prescribed cannabis use no more than nine percent THC and no more than the equivalent or no less than two public equivalent amount of cannabidiol the other last make it to the rely for your prescribing on evidence-based guidelines that are produced by independent medical groups such as the one that dr. Allen produced the simplified guideline to cannabis use in chronic pain or the 2014 guideline from the college of thing and this is important because the companies that are marketing cannabis and many of the medics and clinics that are prescribing cannabis are not reliant and don't have fly with any correction from Health Canada unlike other pharmaceutical functions that we have a product monograph that lets out the evidence-based indications and contraindications and dosing and so on these companies can say pretty well anything they want and many of their claims are in fact not supported by evidence the claims generally are based on anecdotes and other studies that are self-report and the problem with studies using self-report for psychoactive drugs like cannabis is that any any truck that potentially causes Pleasant you work these alcohol or cocaine or opiates will relieve pain will relieve anxiety through mood and however in the long run they make things much worse so if someone says that cannabis and this for many conditions including anxiety the evidence is quite clear that cannabis makes things worse especially with ithc doses so these are the okay thanks Thank You Mel that was great mark I'm gonna go back to you now I'm hoping we're gonna have a good run and I I don't want to interrupt you or put a time limit on because you got interrupted last time so please we'll only I'll only cut in if you're having troubles with with the audio again unfortunately that was unfort that was very unfortunate okay would you mind giving it another go no problem let me just check that you can hear me okay this time around is this working okay yes it is yep okay fantastic so I agree with Mel in that the evidence base is challenging most physicians are working in context of chronic pain with patients who are struggling to manage their pain in spite of the best available evidence and they're coming in with side effects or with poor control of pain even using the faith's it's the drugs in which we do have reasonably good evidence so this is the context that physicians are facing and I'm concerned as Mel a dr. kahan is about the risks but I think in any clinical decision you're trying to balance minimizing or maximizing benefit and there are ways that physicians can use cannabinoids in a safe way for adequate screening using lower doses balancing CBD but it's important doubt that for a lot of what dr. Khan is presenting including using prescription cannabinoids as a first-line agent when considering this it also based on fairly thin evidence NAB alone which is being used quite extensively by physicians in Canada has a very limited evidence base for use in pain conditions I did one study with fibromyalgia patients I'm not aware of very many formal clinical trials where an abalone has been studied for chronic pain and yet we're more comfortable using it now I should point out NAB alone is a very potent cb1 agonist it's it's it's a very strong cannabinoid and in theory has the same risks as cognitive impairment driving related accidents long-term dependence and so on so far the data that we've done and I've done long term safety studies what Knab alone to suggest that it's not abuse it doesn't seem to have this addiction potential there's no reason why we shouldn't be doing the same kind of work with cannabinoids and in fact as much as dr. kahan points out the use of cannabis as a smoked row we're seeing increasingly patients using cannabis in oral form in oils or in soft gels which are now become of becoming available so mitigating the risks of smoking is something that clinicians and inform patients about there are vaporizers there are other methods of delivery which can minimize risk if they are looking to use cannabis or cannabinoids as a therapeutic option and it should always be done in full collaboration with the patient and in the context of a comprehensive pain management strategy great ok thank you guys I'm gonna one of the questions that's been posed is actually highly relevant to a question that we have coming up so I'm gonna switch to our questions right now and then I'll get you each and Marc you started and finished first and last so I'm gonna have Mel start this time so the question that we'd like you to to specifically address Mel is most family for the points rather most family physicians have patients with conditions pain that are not adequately managed with treatments presently available so I want you to address that piece which is and and focus here on those with neuropathic pain the ones that we and I'm saying neuropathic because that's where we have relatively good evidence but I want you to also then go into a little bit of discussion around other pain conditions where the evidence is not as strong so things like back pain and headache and so Mel we'll start with you and then go to to mark situations that doctors commonly confront when is the patient who is already using cannabis or a pain condition and there I think the questions that you need to address are is it helping him or her and are there any harms that are resulting so if you have a patient who is using a small dose of cannabis with CBD a small dose of CBD equal to or more than THC and they have no risk factors for cannabis problems and they say that it's helping me to improve their daily function and they are activity in their mood of course you would support that or a source it or even prescribe it it's necessary however if you have a patient on the other hand he says that they have on a pain neuropathic or otherwise and there are at high risk for harms that are younger they have conferring anxiety disorders they have a past history of substance use their smoking very high announced two grams of 20% THC or more they are having social dysfunction that not involved with work they're socially isolated there's a very good chance that that cannabis was in fact harming them severely and the physician needs to address that and work with it so I think it all depends on the patient's presentation you have to individualize your therapy and your approach of course cannabis was not armed everyone or even most people but you know it is a significant harm and and the second Americans want to mention is when a is it on cannabis but they have orally control of the neuropathic pain to sway that booth file of this line medications and there one might consider the pharmaceutical cannabinoids but as Mark said the evidence were safety and effectiveness means while it may be limited is still far greater than for dried cannabis Hawaii reduce added EXO Navajo is first in an adequate trial and then if you are going to provide dried cannabis first why be careful about patient selection I was avoid using it in high-risk patients that is so special for it and IV and substance use disorders and so on and I would use the small goes with small amounts of CBD and THC great thank thanks Mel mark do you want me to read the question again are you okay to jump in no I'm okay to jump in I think it's something which most physicians who are who are participating in this panel will recognize they will see these kinds of patients as dr. kahan pointed out the one already using the one who's curious and I think in today's world where we have legal cannabis now recreationally available since October of last year I suspect clinicians will be seeing more and more patients coming in asking if they should think about cannabis for a wide range of conditions including pain management as well as many others which we may discuss later so the approach is a good one at proper patient screening informing the patient of what we know about the potential risks and the potential benefits and also what we don't know that there are gaps in our knowledge but I think the other key piece in both cases is proper monitoring of the patient and follow-up ensuring that if they are going to continue using cannabis in whatever form as a therapy that you have clearly defined treatment goals and that the patient works towards achieving those and if the treatment goals aren't met in a reasonable space of time that the therapy be discontinued and you move to the next line of treatment so I think good medicine applies here well and there are many circumstances where physicians are using medications off-label or for which there is limited evidence but they can still do it in the context of proper patient care and proper patient follow-up and so that's the piece that I would I would add to this is really adequate patient follow-up and unfortunately we don't have good guidelines and clinicians aren't well educated as to how to initiate and follow patients carefully if they're considering using cannabinoids as a therapy excellent yes all right I hear from both of you that it is much like it would be wonderful if this was a concrete thing that we could say one way or the other everyone should be offered at first-line or something like that but it's just not that way it's Futch it's it's much different than that it is a potentially dependent substance and all sorts of things and it requires a much more nuanced approach based on the individual patient in front of you so I appreciate that I think as clinicians that's that's our job we have to accept that many of the things that lie in front of us are not simple black and white answers and so I appreciate that there is a question that I think could be relevant to this and I'll start with Marc addressing this because I think he might have a little more given his research background but this is a question around you know the the Newport the newer products that are coming available like oils and that kind of thing and asking what do we really know about the the differences between oils and whether they're smoked whether they're consumed doesn't eaten does that does that change the effectiveness of these or how quickly they work or their adverse event profile how does that work if I'm if whether it's smoked or or whether it's consumed orally or something like that do we where are we with that Marc do you know yeah so as dr. Kant pointed out when you smoked cannabis you get a very rapid plasma level it's a quick onset it doesn't last very long two to three hours and of course with in large doses the risks of having central effects cognitive effects and so on become much higher when you're taking a large dose in all our trials and as best as we can we've always advised that patients use the lowest possible dose to achieve the therapeutic benefit and minimize the likelihood of any impairing effects and long term studies have shown that patients generally speaking with chronic intractable pain conditions are able to find a dose which can lead to improve function improve pain control and minimize the likelihood of central essential side-effects so I think dose selection is important even in inhale cannabis of course for that short acting in fact the vaporizer there are two medically approve a per eise's in Canada so physicians can counsel patients who who are using it in an inhaled group to use a much safer method we know it's clear now that vaporization yields much less toxins much fewer poly aromatic hydrocarbons and the kinds of toxins in smoke so that's a safer approach the oral route as you point out the oils and the capsules that look much more like the kind of pharmaceutical cannabinoids that were mentioned earlier Knab alone and Nabisco malls are taken orally they're absorbed through the stomach is a much slower onset one two sometimes even three hours before the effect starts to be noticed and of course it lasts a lot longer it's a much longer acting approach it's been quite surprising in fact to see how patients with chronic pain which is of course a long-term chronic condition respond reasonably well to these kinds of longer acting long slower onset medications it's a chronic stable condition and a low slow level of plasma levels of cannabinoids in fact is a good fit so I think there's good reason to be considering these oils as an option to inhale cannabinoids and for most patients they simply aren't aware that cannabis is available in this form so very important that clinicians know what the different administration techniques and routes are that are available to them legally Thank You Mel anything to add to the this and it is kind of a wave right now there's certainly we're seeing a lot more enthusiasm for all the alternative delivery systems and the alternative products particularly the oils and edibles so Mel any thoughts about them as far as it an intervention for and you could also weigh in and they're like are they potentially less safe that kind of thing well I think it's true as Mark said that they have a slower onset of accidental death you know for a given dose they're less likely to project constipation they may even last longer in terms of pain control but there have certainly been numerous reports of people using edibles with candies and so on containing very large amounts of cannabis that get absorbed and cause a very toxic reaction including psychosis so I think that the edibles need to have the same kind of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic testing as any pharmaceutical product before you can say that they're absolutely safe thank thank you for that so we're on our next one and I think we'll go to mark first for this one is family physicians are also encounter patients requesting cannabinoids for conditions where the evidence base is poor or absent and examples of that mark knows the anxiety evidences is weak at least the RCT evidence it's really based on one RCT and the depression evidence is absent so how do we how do we manage that and and then I'm gonna put on top of that if you will the idea that some of our patients will report that they're there already and and Mel brought this up earlier that they're already users and they'll say when I use this my anxieties far better and we know that that's how do we differentiate that that's actually helping the patient with anxiety versus what is likely as Mel pointed out the the high that they receive from the product and therefore that's what's relieving their anxiety and it's really only working short-term so first of all two-part question is is how do we manage the patients requesting when there's poor evidence base and then what about when they when they actually tipep they've actually know about they've used the product they it is working yeah this is a really tough question because the perhaps I'll start just by reminding us that just because there's no evidence doesn't mean that it couldn't be potentially effective it just means we don't have ever it's one way or the other we do know that certainly cannabinoids can worsen anxiety in some patients we do know I just published as a with a group of colleagues a systematic review of cannabis use in young people being associated with worsening outcomes in terms of depression later in life so we know that in certain patients population risk factors are important I certainly don't think that young people adolescent using cannabis as 3-prime guides in depression is something that can be condoned I think we're talking here about the use of cannabis in adult patients with intractable anxiety disorders as an option - or as an adjunct to other approaches that they might be considering of course we know that there are arm associated with existing anxiety medication benzodiazepines in particular so the question becomes a relative risk it are cannabic more harmful in terms of tensile I see them existing then they give me the apathy okay mark we're losing you again start lifting you a bit there just try one more time and let's see if we can hear you this time okay I'll try and remember what I said I'm sorry no it's okay I think you know but my counsel here is that we aren't talking about using cannabinoids in young people in their adolescent treatment least we know that there are at harms with using cannabis early in life and that those are clear the issue is in older patients with anxiety and and comparing Annabeth's and its risks with other existing medications like benzodiazepines so it's always a question of relative risk with existing therapies and of course for some patients anxiety is debilitating very troublesome and in the same way that chronic pain doesn't all respond to existing therapies there may be patients who wish to try using a cannabis preparation as of self medication for anxiety and that could be brought into the clinical context with proper education and follow-up okay thank you Mark Mel your thoughts on this and would you like me to read the statement again that you can or are you ready to jump in do you think no I'm I'm ready traumatic stress disorder because that's one anxiety disorder that there's you know a lot of talk about and how cannabis could cure it I would say a few things mark is right that THC in particular has been associated with worsening anxiety and can in fact cause denovo acute anxiety in patients where not you know who don't have existing anxiety there I wouldn't totally agree with mark that cannabis is equivalent to other medications in terms of its knowing safety in fact the studies on PTSD and cannabis have by and large being pretty negative and have found strong associations with poor outcomes odds cutting speeds themself with work yes there will be some patience who is weren't that it counts the food and so on but studies with more objective competence and measures cohort studies have found that cannabis heavily cannabis use in particular is associated with harm for example a study of that veterans in the United States we're waiting to go into an inpatient residential treatment program the ones that started cannabis at any time before or after their residential treatment program had worse outcomes in terms of including violence compared to those in use cannabis or stop it so I would say that the bulk of the evidence is Supreme Court in the cannabis particularly CPH see now CBD may have an opposite at that it may have an anxiety of that and plumbing pseudo program cannabinoids I known Avalon has had some benefit in a post traumatic stress disorder that's another example all together but again canthus eyes that any drug with a pleasant euphoric effect is going to be perceived as relieving anxiety including alcohol alcohol so remarkably effective anxiety in the short term but the problem is that heavy use and leads to serious problems thank thank you melt one of the things that you you mentioned and actually mark has mentioned to the CBD versus THC and of course as you know that's kind of the one of the movements that's going on right now maybe if we more we were more nuanced in how much THC versus CBD we're using and particularly if we focused more on the CBD we'd be able to treat other conditions without some of the adverse events or at least not as many of the adverse events Mel you mentioned a little bit about it would you care to to kind of just wait in a tiny bit more on the CBD versus THC your your thoughts your thoughts there well there's some evidence that sea beast CBD does have a reduction in anxiety calming effect most importantly it's not associated with the harms of THC including euphoria addiction and cognitive impairment furthermore preparations that have equal amounts of THC and CBD the CBD seems to counteract with some extent the effects of THC so I think that there is some promise in CBD unfortunately cannabis companies are producing like I say these extraordinarily high and potent THC products for which I think are harmful and there's no evidence for medical benefit thanks mark your thoughts about this CBD and THC distribution components as far as for medicinal purposes so I think maybe just to pick up on those lock point cannabis companies are of course also producing CBD in capsules and oils and for many clinicians there are guidelines or guidance preparation documents being put together that suggests that CBD only or predominant CBD preparations should be tried if you're going to consider a cannabis therapy as a first line so the availability of CBD predominant oils and capsules and even flower herbs are now there so and this is important because it's a relatively recent piece of the story up until four years ago there were no CBD preparations available when I was doing trials and studying cannabis in 2000 to 2015 there was zero access to cannabis with any CBD in it so this is a very new and obviously very exciting for the reasons that mal have pointed out but I would also caution that CBD is metabolized by liver enzymes and in high doses those can interact with other medications the patients are taking so I don't think we should be walking away thinking that CBD is entirely without its own potential harms and we know from pediatric epilepsy studies where CBD has been used in very high doses for children with intractable seizure disorders that there's a well described interaction with clovers on commonly prescribed anticonvulsant so I think we have to always be careful we don't jump on the CVD bandwagon assuming it's completely safe it may turn around and be happy its own risks though I certainly wouldn't advocate for a whole heart to the absorption of CBD as the safe cannabinoid the evidence around combining the two very compelling and it would make a great story if it was in fact that powerful I've done studies comparing side effects of teats the only preparations with THC and CBD preparations and in fact the harms or the adverse events both quantitatively and qualitatively are quite similar even with the presence of an equal amounts of CBD so again let's just be careful that just assuming that their CBD there doesn't mitigate completely the likelihood of having central effects from THC alone it may be that the levels of CBD required to actually have those effects are much higher than are available in standard one-to-one therapy so I think there's a lot more work to do here but what is encouraging is that we have CBD preparations available and there's a commitment to doing major studies on CBD in both anxiety and pain disorders thank you thanks for that well we're gonna go back to you with our next discussion point and that is well some feel that the enthusiasm for cannabis mirror's airs around opioid prescribing from 20 years ago and you you mentioned this in your opening statement there are also a lot of people who feel that cannabis can be very helpful in managing patients with opioid use disorder either to decrease those people on high doses to decrease their doses or potentially even help in having them stop using opioids entirely now as I said there's so there's kind of these two camps a very strong opinion and I'm wondering how do you reconcile these two approaches one that it could be this panacea that's going to fix from our opioid epidemic and opioid use disorder or at least help treat it on all the way to the idea that maybe it's actually just we're making the mistakes of the past how do you how do you kind of reconcile this well the idea or the notion that cannabis helps with opioid use disorder was based on a couple of studies what we call ecological studies where in states in the United States they found that over those rights from opiates were reduced in states that have legalized cannabis this is a very weak form of evidence because they're not linking a patient's actual use of care to this and individuals use of cannabis with their over those risks they're talking about a statewide level and in fact the subsequent analysis is showing that there is no association when you take into account past timeframes and over those rate observational studies so clearly showing that patients who use cannabis are more in fact likely to also be prescriptions opiate miss users heels opiates and higher doses and that's not surprising we know that there's a strong association between drug use in general that is someone who drinks alcohol heavily is more likely to use cocaine is more likely to use opiates and it's more likely to use cannabis there is I think clinically some pretty strong evidence of someone who's a cavity cannabis smokers is in fact less likely to recover because of the effects of cannabis on motivation making them more depressant in the more anxious and you're dealing with two potential addictions rather than what finally I have to say there are some very strong treatments available for abuse disorder that is methadone buprenorphine and other treatments and I think and these have a very strong pharmacological rationale which I don't see a candidate's and I'm really concerned that people think that by smoking a lot of cannabis they can somehow cure their youths disorder I don't think there's any evidence whatsoever for that now the second point which is quite a different one is will cannabis be able to help people use lower Kosovo and to the extent that cannabis is an effective analgesic for a particular patient then yes they may be a little lower their opiate use for that that's not related however told the use disorder the issue for abuse disorder is not keen so much it's the psychoactive effects of the opiate and the thrall and so on so forth so yes if you have a patient with intractable pain who's on high dose of opiates and they're good candidates for cannabis therapy and give a careful trial of it see if they go at that level lower opiate notes thank you milk mark over to you do you want me to read the question again are you you're happy or the statement again are you happy to jump in nope happy to jump in and and perhaps just a couple of points just to pick up on what what Mel was saying I do disagree I think that the pharmacological rationale for cannabinoids to have opioid sparing effects is actually incredibly strong there are very good animal studies showing that these two compounds cannabinoid and opioid or both synthetic and THC are very synergistic and that small doses of both have been shown in animal models could be extremely effective at reducing the same level of behavioral response to painful stimuli than therapeutic doses of each together so this synergism comes from a very strong pharmacological rationale and I think the lack of evidence in clinical trials is is one thing I think there's clear that we need the critical need is to do trials with patients on high dose opioids or with opioid use disorder where cannabinoids are actually tested with proper outcomes and I think that's absolutely critical and there's a big commitment now in the industry to start looking at those kinds of outcomes in FDA sized and approved clinical trials the issue with the ecological evidence though I think it's always a little bit challenging it's interesting to me that some people like to use Association studies as dr. kahan did with PTSD and veterans cannabis use being associated with mental health problems and often that's an association study but that seems to be okay when an association study that shows that states that have approved medical cannabis laws have 25% reductions in opioid mortality suddenly this is now an association study with no validity so we can't really pick and choose associations where we like them and where we don't it's unquestionable that this use of cannabis is by patients and at this Association level is associated with changes in opioid prescribing antidepressants prescribing reductions in sleep meds NGO lytx there are huge changes in prescribing patterns in states where medical cannabis is available now I'm not going to argue that it's causative but I think when we're facing an opioid crisis where thousands of people are dying and the best available treatments aren't getting to these patients as who's good as buprenorphine and methadone might be these people are still dying every day and we are morally bound to look at something that could potentially have an impact and I think naba noids is a strong enough basic science and ecological rationale for us to be taking this very seriously indeed and to say that there's really no evidence and not move forward on that is is not a tenable position I think we have to take this very seriously indeed okay um I'd like to wage in here with one of the points that was raised and I think it's highly relevant to what we're talking about this came as a question very early on it it asked if if patients if cannabinoids contribute to a reduction in tolerance to opioids and if there's a risk with that so patients on opioids they are they start to use cannabinoids and then their tolerance for opioids goes down and therefore they're much more at risk for the adverse events associated with anahat and the serious hazards of dying with the use of opioids because of that change in tolerance Mel I'll start with you and and any any thoughts on that point sure first of all I'd like to respond tomorrow an ecological study is not at all the same as an observational study and an observational study you're looking at an association between an individual's use of cannabis and a certain outcome such as don't fit over them what I'm suggesting fact what I'm saying is that studies have shown that people who are using cannabis are more likely to also be misusing prescription opiates so there's an association between cannabis use and opiate use disorder and handle the use of general an ecological study there is absolutely no association between an individual looking inside of a fentanyl overdose and we don't even know whether they be using cannabis what's acerra so that's why observational studies are much much stronger than you for watching but the second point that I would say and said you cannot absolutely cannot expect that people that cannabis is a potential treatment for opening useful to other no there is no pharmacological rationale for what you talked about is cannabis is potential to reduce only explore paint not nice not to do without heat uske sources what makes opiates addicting is their psychoactive effect and and their Pleasant youth work at that and their relief of withdrawal and that's why methadone the thief and or can work adding another potentially addicting drug on top of that such as cannabis is not going to happen and in fact it's gonna make things worse and until you have a really good and well controlled clinical trial to go back but you I don't think it's ever going to be done then I I think it's not like yeah I recommend that as a treatment for that place well could you could you address the question from the audience the the idea that cannabis somehow changes our tolerance to opioids or our patience honestly I can't mark may be able a better answer that I didn't know that cannabis changes tolerance still yes sorry I was unaware of that to Merck do you have any any feedback for that piece no I've heard the risk and it's a theoretical risk and that being that so if these two drugs are synergistic and no they are if you have somebody on a high dose of an opioid and you add a cannabinoid to that mix does that make the opioid more potent and thereby enhance the likelihood of risk of that opioid so far in clinical practice and from the observational work that's been done there doesn't appear to be evidence of that but what we need are guidelines to suggest that if a patient on high dose opioids is administered a cannabinoid as an adjunctive therapy what are the best ways to reduce the opioid is it a 10% reduction every week is it half the dose you do you wait until you have a therapeutic response with the cannabinoid before you reduce the opioid these are questions when when doing other opioid rotation what clinical work so same kinds of questions apply but I don't see that because the two receptor pathways are so different I don't see evidence emerging yet that adding cannabinoids to opioids increases the tolerance or the likelihood of risk of the opioid by itself thank you so guys just in the acid in the interest of time we're gonna jump to the last one and it's going to come back to mark first so and this is our last of our discussion points so there are patients who have cannabis use disorder or similar and they present to their family physician seeking authorization of their medical cannabis now certainly the the legalization has might change this somewhat but we still have patient I think we'll still have patients who are clearly in that kind of camp or were suspicious or concerned that they are and they're asking for authorization for medical cannabinoids so how do you reconcile this issue as much as we have patients who aren't you know who are who who are suffering from pain and we're really we don't we're kind of at our wits end as far as what to give them we've got the other side of the coin which is these patients who come in and often I've seen it in my practice where they haven't tried any other agent and they just want to jump to cannabis and I'm concerned about their their issue of dependence and and cannabis use disorder so mark if you could start with that one and then we'll switch over to Mel thanks I'm gonna defer to to Mel's expertise in in defining and and reminding us what those elements of cannabis use disorder are clearly it's a recognised syndrome and it's diagnosed in the dsm-5 and the criteria are well defined I think that the wreck the recreational legalization of cannabis actually increases the need for physicians to be vigilant about cannabis use and potential problems when prior to legalization patients were coming asking for access because it was the only legal way to get it then it became a question that physicians and and Mel's guidelines recommended that using the cannabis use disorder guidelines should be used as screening tools and that's fair I think in the absence of medical use where patients may be people may be using cannabis recreationally they could still qualify for cannabis use disorder and so physicians need to know what these are and how the screen for them I think where it gets challenging is separating out what is safe and responsible cannabis use somebody who is not at risk who uses cannabis in a sensible way as part of their recreational lifestyle choice instead of alcohol and we're beginning to see people using cannabis now instead of other drugs like alcohol and substituting so having these conversations with patients is very important and recognizing that there will be a large number of people for whom cannabis use isn't a major problem for them they are able to counsel their use they're able to titrate it they're able to continue being professionally active and and and have healthy and happy lives so understanding how if when it becomes problematic is something that I think is a really important thing for family physicians across Canada to be able to recognize now and and so I would ask Mel to help us understand how and when to recognize that in our practices so that we can counsel those patients to get the appropriate help but not to rule um everybody who uses cannabis as a recreational therapy or as a pain option as being somebody with a diagnosis of cannabis use disorder thanks mark Mel over to you so cannabis use disorder is characterized like other addictions by generally daily heavy use however that's defined 2 or 3 grams or more particularly a high dose THC products or high potency THC products as the patient is spending a lot of time using you know with not much else they're not productive they're spending hours and hours in their house or room or whatever smoking and using they have social dysfunction that is they're isolated they may not be productive they're not involved with their family they tend to have a poor mood anxiety and depression and they have difficulty stopping because the majority of very heavy users will in fact out in the draw systems so they will try stopping and they can't for longer than a day or two and the risk factors for cannabis use disorder are pre-existing anxiety or mood disorder and that's when the patient finds that cannabis helps their mood a pre-existing substance use disorder either past or current and a and youth younger age and possibly male so young man we have had a problem with out for drugs in the past who have an anxiety or mood disorder or PTSD or more likely to develop cannabis use problem the the treatments pharmacologically the freakin flower cannabis replacements with nav alone for example or a set of cysteine or some a other agent but the mainstay of treatment is individual and group they're part of the problem is it's hard to convince patients sometimes that the need for treatment especially if they heal at cannabis it's essential for their mood or anxiety but I agree with mark that all physicians need to be aware of in abysus disorder to recognize it and to make those referrals and interventions because one can anticipate that the prevalence the cannabis use disorder will be going up with the lightly okay thank you very much we're doing to move back to the slides now and we're just going to because we're running out of time but we did want to give an opportunity for people participating in the webinar to again have a vote and the questions were I'll just review them again I'm comfortable authorizing cannabis for conditions with little or no RCT evidence like depression and for conditions with reasonable evidence like neuropathic pain I'm comfortable authorizing the second one is I'm comfortable authorizing cannabis for conditions with reasonable evidence like neuropathic pain only and then the third choice is I'm not comfortable authorizing cannabis but we'll do on some rare occasions and the last one is I will not authorize medical cannabinoids or cannabis and as you point out when we say cannabinoids we're talking about Knab alone the Vixen balls are Sativex if you like and the and as you as you guys pointed out the research for NAB alone in pain is not very strong it's just there's just not a lot of it but for but for the big so malls the research is actually quite robust in the pain area but anyhow we're seeing here that a lot of people are kind of positioning themselves in the I am not comfortable authorizing cannabis but will do so on rare circumstances and I would say it's interesting that my experience is that a fair number of my colleagues sit in that kind of camp where and and I think it also came out in some of the questions and the very statements given by both our panelists and that is that the this is a challenging thing and we got into medicine despite all of the jokes about us getting into it for money and all the other reasons and fame we we did get into it to help people and we're really when you're confronted with someone who you know is suffering and you want to make things available for them if if you do address the potential risks and harms that we've discussed earlier the costs of medical cannabinoids and you've you've tried some of the the pharmaceutical derived cannabinoids all that kind of thing I don't think that any of us would dismiss the use entirely but it is it is a very nuanced area of Medicine that requires some thought and I think both of our panelists did an excellent job today they absolutely have different viewpoints that's clear but I actually saw as much or more common ground than I saw a really polarized view so I really appreciate you both for participating in today's webinar and I know I changed it from a debate to this kind of discussion and I hope that was okay for both of you but I know that our our participants really did appreciate it thank you very much thank you [Music]
2lsXC-BADyY,Cannabis as a Natural Treatment for Autism,2019-12-23T19:00:00Z,"- Nate started taking
medication for autism when he was around five years old. As Nate was getting into high school, the aggression levels just really started spiraling out of control. He randomly started running
into other classrooms, punching people for nothing. It took four adult men and
handcuffs to bring him down to the ground, cuff him and restrain him. At that time, he was taking
18 pills every single day. And it wasn't even helping. I started researching the
medical marijuana states. We were able to come to California. I remembered seeing the
big neon cannabis leaf in the window, I'm like, ""Well
that's gotta be where we have to go."" (laughs) (upbeat music) - [Interviewer] Why don't you
tell me a little bit about your family, you have three kids. - Okay, my name is Jenni Mai. I have three sons on the autism spectrum. Each child is of course so
different, like any other child, and as far as them being on
the spectrum, Nathan is what is considered to be at
the very severe end. And rather than trying to
find the right medication, they just gave him more
and more and more of it, and that was really the
only solution they had. I did not want him being
chemically restrained in a bed, being (crying) taken care of by strangers. I'm sorry. I had come across this little video clip of a young boy who was just
repeatedly punching himself in the head. - [Reporter] 11 year old Alex
Ekels is severely autistic. His self-destructive
behavior brought on by-- - And it caught my attention because it was something that Nate had done. His parents were talking
about giving him some kind of an oil. I was confused, because it
sounded like it was some kind of a marijuana derivative,
and I was actually shocked and maybe even a little bit disgusted. - [Reporter] And after a
few months of treatment, the Ekels say they saw
a dramatic improvement. - Within just a few
minutes of this boy taking the oil orally, he was
smiling, he was calm, and he wasn't hurting himself
anymore, and I'm like, ""Wait, what just happened there?"" (laughs) I watched it a few more times, and I was completely
shocked and desperate. - At that point, Jenni
and her family just moved from Wisconsin to Missouri. Two states where getting pot
legally for really any reason is super difficult, but particularly medical
cannabis to treat autism. Currently only 12 states include autism as a qualifying condition. Five other states and
the District of Colombia are considered autism friendly, meaning doctors can
recommend medical cannabis for debilitating conditions. So that leaves 33 states
where you can't access medical cannabis to treat autism at all. - I was raised in the Nancy
Reagan ""Just say no"" era. - Say no to drugs, and say yes to life. - I would have never in
my life considered this to be a medicine, but I
basically told my husband, ""We have to try that."" - Like most illicit drugs, the scientific and medical research of
marijuana has been challenging. But the tide appears to be turning. The first large scale
clinical trials underway in Montefiore medical
center in New York City. And it may be the key to
unlocking access to treatment for children with autism, nationwide. Dr. Eric Hollander is leading that study. - I've been involved in research
developing new therapies and treatments, in
autism spectrum disorders for about 30 years, and there's a big need to develop treatments for the
poorer symptoms of autism. - This study focuses on a new
compound called Cannabidivarin or CBDV, it's an extract from
the cannabis plants similar to CBD, it doesn't include THC, the psychoactive drug that gets you high, and what Jenni uses to treat Nate, but it's the first step
to studying cannabis to treat autism. - This particular
cannabinoid has some effects on some of the underlying mechanisms that we think are essential to autism. The problem behaviors,
the destructive behaviors, and also in some of the
compulsive behaviors, or repetitive behaviors or
perseverative behaviors, so it gets at a key mechanism
that we think is important. - There is reason to be optimistic. This new CBDV based drug is similar to one that's already been approved by the FDA to treat a severe form of
epilepsy that shares some of the same symptoms that
Dr. Hollander is studying. This new research could
help cement what has largely been anecdotal support of
using cannabis to treat autism. But while that research is
ongoing, parents like Jenni are moving to states that
have more lax marijuana laws. For Jenni and her family, that
meant packing up everything and moving all the way across the country. That decision may sound
extreme, but for Jenni and Nate, it's been worth it. Their lives have been transformed since first visiting a dispensary. - We got home, and he
took a hit immediately. We got this one. - [Nate] Okay. - And within, not even five minutes, it was just like a light switch. He was happy, and just kind
of looking around like, he had never seen the world
in that way and he was smiling and looking at me, and
I just knew right away, 'cause nothing acted that
quickly or that positively ever. - Jenni has learned a lot since moving her family out to California. There she joined forces
with fellow mom, Ronda, to start the non-profit
Whole Plant Access For Autism. Now it's a team of moms
dedicating their lives to helping other families
navigate the challenges that come with getting cannabis
for their autistic kids. - I feel like a lot of people
that come to our booth, someone in their lives has
been touched by autism, and they don't know that
this is an option for them. Other times we get people that you know, come to us after the event, they email us or they find us on social
media and they want to learn. And that's kind of what we're
about, we're about educating. - We decided to take a
drive out to Joshua Tree. I had him vape and take an edible right before we left the house. He saw that I saw taking
pictures and most of the other pictures that I've
ever taken of him in his life, it was kind of a vacant stare,
he wouldn't really look, he wouldn't really smile, and
he ran over in front of me and sat down. He sat there and he posed for a picture, like everybody else would
in a situation like that. (sniffs) And I just, I'm like, ""That's it. That's basically his birth picture."" You shouldn't have to go
through the whole gamut of medications and side effects
and long-term consequences of some of those side effects
in order to get to it. Just look at cannabis as another tool in your tool belt to try. - Thanks for watching. For more Dope Science content,

rwmDZvhVY9Q,Chronic Pain and Medicinal Cannabis - Dr Tamara Nation - NIIM Free Public Seminar August 2019,2019-08-16T01:54:18Z,[Music] tamarah graduated from the university of melbourne medical school and then did her PhD at st. Vincent's Hospital and royal Children's Hospital my apologies she was then at Saint Vincent's Hospital and the Royal Children's Hospital and completed a PhD at the murder Children's Research Institute tomorrow then undertook general practice training and became a fellow of the RSC GP she is now an examiner for the Royal College of General Practitioners tomorrow has undertaken multiple training courses in medicinal cannabis therapy both in Australia and attended conferences overseas she is a TGA authorized prescriber and is treating patients with medicinal cannabis I'll now pass you over to tomorrow so thank you and today I'd like to discuss chronic pain and medicinal cannabis I've been prescribing medicine or cannabis for about 12 months and it was not a journey that I thought I would be on as a medical practitioner but I had a patient who grabbed my hand one day and said to me I've been taking black-market Canada's has provided amazing results could you please prescribe me this medicine or cannabis I've heard about on TV so guided by her interests the best heart I embarked on my journey to learn about this product before I begin I want to first take a step back and define pain so what is pain and a textbook in medicine says it's an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage Harrison's textbook of internal medicine simile says it's an unpleasant sensation described in terms of penetrating or tissue destruction however a pain a clinical manual says pain is whatever the Varian singh person says it does as lewis says it's really important to distinguish between acute and chronic pain as these are two very distinct entities acute pain is a result of tissue injury it's temporary it acts as an alarm system it ceases as the tissue heals and last moments days or weeks if you look at this diagram you see that there's an initial tissue injury there's an inflammatory process cellular proliferation then remodeling and cessation with healing in chronic pain however this continues on beyond the initial injury a normal here link does not occur and there's a development of a sustained pain signal chronic pain typically lasts greater than three months so why does chronic pain occur well as in most chronic diseases this is a multifactorial entity it includes genetics as Lewis said digestion and the microbiome one's own physiology psychology immunology drug use past and present environment including toxins and one's own individual nervous system henceforth the chronic pain cycle is a significant circuit in the periphery nerves become over sensitized so does the spinal cord and messages are magnified to the brain reaching and triggering the perception of pain this causes a central sensitization syndrome brain reorganization and as described earlier with the process of aging that can be subsequent muscle spasm and deconditioning henceforth this abnormal pain pathway response is significant and moods emotions and one's functional capacity are also affected another interesting way of looking at chronic pain is a chronic pain model where there's tissue damage pain sensation thoughts emotions suffering and then the end product pain behaviors so what do the statistics show in Australia looking at the national prescribing service one in five Australians suffer from chronic pain and this number increases to one in three of people aged over thirty five sixty five thirty thank you and what are the comorbidities of chronic pain there was a Canadian study that looked at chronic pain sufferers after a period of two years and 16% of these developed depression their sleep disturbance fatigue changes to neuro cognition with a change in neuroplasticity and a loss of gray matter a generalized diffuse pain state reduction in quality of life and reduced productivity so as a practitioner what are the current management options at this present point 50 to 60 percent of people with chronic pain use pharmacotherapy only to manage this condition and most people with chronic pain take at least one medication however the current guidelines recommend the medication should only be used alongside non pharmacological therapy such as socialization physical therapies and psychological therapies [Applause] looking at the therapeutic guidelines it's found the drugs used to treat chronic pain non-malignant work in only one third of people and at best they reduce pain by only 30 to 50 percent henceforth pharmacological therapy alone frustrates both patients and doctors what are our current options well firstly there's paracetamol it rarely relieves pain completely but can modify its severity then there's a non-steroidal anti-inflammatories the recommendation is lowest possible dose shortest possible time and continue daily use not recommended they can have significant side effects cardiovascular health on blood pressure myocardial disease gastrointestinal health with gastritis and peptic ulcer as well as renal disease and nephrotoxicity opioids as mentioned before including things like codeine tramadol oxycodone morphine well we all know there's an opioid epidemic and recently opioids were all scheduled s four or more and these this particular class of medication is not ideal for treatment of chronic pain they can be respiratory issues cardiovascular issues neurological confusion delirium sedation gut problems such as Lewis mentioned with constipation and a reduction in motility and dysbiosis furthermore there can be dependence tolerance addiction and in fact an increase in pain from opioid use another class of drugs commonly used are antidepressants the thinking behind these medications is more for neuropathic pain where they inhibit serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake however if we actually look at the statistics associated with these medications tricyclic antidepressants only one in two to three get a therapeutic benefit when treated with these medicines SNR is one in four to five patients and SSRIs one in seven again there's a gamut of side-effects dry mouth constipation urinary retention and loss of libido the other class that we often use for chronic pain management is anti-epileptics such as gabapentin and pregabalin these inhibit the excitatory neurons in the brain and spinal cord they may increase the effects of gaba and interfere with substance P noradrenaline and glutamate however with gabapentin there's limited evidence and it typically requires six to seven patients to be treated before a clinically relevant outcome is seen and with pregabalin this is four to five patients again there are many side effects sedation confusion depression henceforth there are limitations in the management of chronic pain and this is because it is such a multifactorial disease process affecting neurological systems inflammatory systems hormonal systems as well as gastrointestinal systems therefore in order to address it we need to address all these circuits so this brings me to the second part of the talk medicine or cannabis and chronic pain so if we look at cannabinoids there they are in fact used for multiple disease processes not just chronic pain ADHD Alzheimer's bipolar chronic Teague Crohn's depression epilepsy fibromyalgia migraine MS Parkinson's rheumatoid Tourette's and if we look at where the cannabis receptors are located in the body we see that there throughout the body there's cb1 and cb2 receptors CB one or more more widely studied there in the brain in the lungs in the vascular system in the gut in reproductive organs they're also very expansive there and cb2 receptors we can see in immune cells in lymphoid cells in bone marrow pancreas skin and if we look at the cb1 receptor distribution in the brain this is the most common g-protein coupled receptor in the brain with the highest densities in the hippocampus the cortex the cerebellum the amygdala basal ganglia henceforth it has effects on short-term memory cognition mood motor function and pain it's important to note that there are no cb1 receptors in the brain stem henceforth no negative effects in terms of respiration so how does this endocannabinoid system work in terms of cellular signaling well it's produced in the post synaptic nerve terminal it crosses the cell membrane and activates the receptors on the presynaptic terminal and suppresses neurotransmitter release in the sympathetic nervous system it therefore inhibits noradrenaline release it can reduce sympathetic mediated pain and it can modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in the parasympathetic nervous system it can again reduce hyperactivity and lead to homeostasis as seen with the anti-nausea effects and in terms of the pain pathways well that can annoyed receptors are present in the peripheral system so in peripheral nerves affecting skin in spinal pathways and in cortical pathways hence they have a significant inhibitory response to pain Ethan Rousseau is a well-known neurologist and scientist in Canada who's hypothesized that there is the condition that can be attributed to endocannabinoid deficiency henceforth our own innate endocannabinoid system and he proposes that in conditions such as fibromyalgia irritable bowel syndrome and other non-responsive pain syndromes this may be due to an endocannabinoid deficiency so the next part of the talk is on medicine or cannabis and when I talking about medicinal cannabis today I'm talking about plant-based products in particular phyto cannabinoids which there are over a hundred and fifty but the main ones that we typically discuss at THC and CBD and the wonderful thing about medicine or cannabis and phyto cannabinoids is that they also contain other active ingredients which are less than known such as terpenes and flavonoids but we are thinking that they have an entourage effect so they work in concert with the THC and CBD to provide a therapeutic response in terms of pain and inflammation so medicinal cannabis for thousands of years it's been used as a medicine by a vast number of cultures including ayurvedic medicine traditional chinese medicine currently the TGA guidelines have accredited reasonably for pain insomnia seizures nausea and anxiety and THC which is thought to be the more potent cannabinoid in particular for pain insomnia seizures and nausea whereas CBD is more often used for anxiety although in higher doses it can also be used for management of pain it's thought to be that THC is a partial agonist at cb1 receptors and CBD is an antagonist at these receptors so there's a synergy between these two components of medicine or cannabis it would therefore seem that medicine or cannabis is a reasonable therapeutic option for the management of chronic pain however it is still today - the medical evidence lacking and this has been because chronic pain it consists of a heterogeneous group of individuals often difficult to streamline the trials that have been done have often been observational and of short duration and there's variation in the different cannabis products used furthermore there's a lack of placebo in these trials it's also important to note the medicine or cannabis itself has side effects and these can be weakness confusion dizziness memory problems fatigue hallucinations and chronic use can cause cannabis use disorder cognitive impairment bronchitis if inhaled and there can be possible social work dysfunction as well as issues with driving in terms of my clinical experience I've treated over 50 patients with medicinal cannabis over the past 12 months for a range of conditions and a range of formulations of THC and CBD I've had really positive response a response to therapy with medicinal cannabis an average of 8 out of 10 have reported good effect I've also had patients who've experienced side effects dizziness brain fog increase in appetite and weight gain but as I said there's been some really good results with return to function improve sleep and reduction in polypharmacy in particular one patient who I recently treated who was using a walking stick for mobility because of her chronic pain getting the level Rite of medicinal cannabis meant that she no longer needed to ambulate with a walking stick and was comfortable moving around independently so to conclude what to expect when you embark on a journey with medicinal cannabis therapy well I think the key is to expect it's going to take time and that it is a journey as a therapeutic trial in my practice here at NIMH the aim is to provide really good standards of care and to have a dedicated interpretive discussion regarding pain management and an integrative approach to chronic pain you

iHO4RNb2lNs,Can your medical marijuana get you fired?,2019-07-26T02:53:26Z,we revealed that multiple employers have updated their policies to allow some protection for certain employees with a medical marijuana card but it can get complicated and few of them wanted to speak on camera saying they simply don't want to be the quote poster child for this and users said dispensaries literally turned away when we asked if they were worried about repercussions at work saying they didn't want their bosses to know but what we found is so long as there is not a safety concern employers are being proactive since May 10th the day the first patient Sean sharp made history legally purchasing medical marijuana and Arkansas dispensaries have sold three point four six million in product he's everything to me yeah I spend more Claudie time my granddaughter it's worth it a doctor issued sharp his card for help following a cancer diagnosis and while sharp never mentioned to us any employment concerns now that he has a legal card others do worry the easiest thing to do is to just have a blanket policy nobody can use any kind of drug that's considered a controlled substance under federal law and this that's a safe position for employers to take but law professor Terrence Cain says when Arkansas voters legalized medical marijuana the employment landscape in our state changed federally pot is still illegal but not in Arkansas anymore so while employers here are not required to change policy we've learned many of them are doing so anyway rather than invite litigation over whether this is an Employment Practice that runs afoul of anti-discrimination law just try to be proactive and see if there's a way to have persons do what they're supposed to do with respect to their job responsibilities we asked eight of Central Arkansas largest employers or organizations to share policy changes with us city of Little Rock to City of North Little Rock UAMS Baptist Health Arkansas Children's the Little Rock School District Pulaski County special school district and the Arkansas trucking association only the trucking association prohibits it entirely sharing with me quote commercial drivers are subject to federal law which prohibits marijuana use of any kind truck drivers are not allowed to consume marijuana in any form even with a card children's and PCs SD are still working to update policy to address the changes the rest all have some protections in place you AMS saying it will not take action against an employee who tests positive for THC in a random drug screen provided that the employee has appropriate medical documentation and is not impaired on the job Baptist follows saying if you have a medical marijuana card you will not be terminated if you test positive for THC as long as you aren't impaired at work and in places where medical marijuana is allowed like Arkansas then an employer has to consider whether the employer employee is at a position that he or she can do the job the protections end however when an employee is in a safety sensitive position for example police fire medical drivers or people who operate machinery the cities of Little Rock and North Little Rock both say if you're in a safety sensitive position even if you have a card you could be subject to termination if you test positive the same at Little Rock schools there is random drug testing but the outcome depends on position and circumstance if the employee were in a safety and security or transportation they must be drug-free if the employer can demonstrate that being drug-free is necessary for effective performance for the job and consistent with business necessity then the employer can demand that the person be drug-free the bottom line according to professor Kane these are uncharted waters and he expects more policy changes to come I'm curious more than I am anything else as to how this is going to play out in the employment sector the Americans with Disabilities Act protects people with disabilities and it's possible someone could be using medical marijuana for a disability and state law says an employee can't be discriminated against based on disability so employers are no doubt taking that into consideration as well we will continue to follow all developments related to medical marijuana in Arkansas
G09k8Dxn8ho,Olivia Newton-John treating holistic approach to overcoming cancer | 60 Minutes Australia,2019-08-05T09:00:00Z,Olivia the day before I came I had a mammogram and I thought of you is that how you would like to see this to be thought of well they didn't find anything the good yes well the reason I stopped and thought about it was because it's because of your work with your own Research Center that we're now looking at the potential of a blood test instead of a mammogram yes wouldn't that be wonderful they're working on that right now in trial and that would be so fantastic not to have to go through that they're the sorts of things I imagine you never thought would come to fruition no well I mean I believe and I dream that we'll see an end to cancer in my lifetime and I hope it'll be at my hospital but I also hope that we all work together and it's a group effort from all around the world that we can see an end to cancer because it's it's a scourge you have recalibrated people's thinking about how to deal with something like cancer well I hope so I mean I'm only going for my own experience but it really made a huge difference to me and I hear from the patients now when I go visit the Wellness Center because I love going down there what a wonderful healing place it is and how good they feel to have that Center the one thing that I said I would do it if they would put a Wellness Center in because just to be a Cancer Center and just to be doing Western medicine is wonderful and it was a big honor anywhere but the Wellness Center would take us in a more healing way and to say cancer and wellness on the same sign is positive and I wanted to be a positive experience as much as it can be so it was extremely important to me to have that and it was a bit of a battle in the beginning because it wasn't something that was incorporated into hospitals at that time and that's my point you you've instilled in the medical fraternity a little bit of stuff they had been rejecting I think that it was not considered important because there's you know it was a body and a cancer and let's treat that but I believe you have to treat the whole person there's a a human being with fear and and a lot of things going on that need to be addressed and I believe the mind is a huge part of your healing I mean what you believe and what you create is who you are and to keep that positive when you're going through cancer is can be difficult but it's a much better way to be and a much easier way to live have you have you seen a few doctors around I think I have because I see doctors who work at the center now who are in the beginning there were girls skeptical and now they're seeing the results I have to say that you are amazingly resilient I think but generous this is strawberry combination of generosity and resilience thank you that's very kind it's ya know it's uh well it's come very blessed you know I've had the most amazing life and opportunity and wonderful people around me so I'm I'm lucky how a lot of people go through the things that I've gone through and haven't had support or they haven't had the means to be able to deal with it so I never lose sight of that which is really why the hospital is so important to me and why the wellness programs are so important to me because most of the people going through that have never had the experience of anything other than a doctor and and treatment and now they get to get more and get supported which is really important I mean we have the best doctors and best nurses and the best treatments but the programs that support the person is really important - mmm well the cure must come it will I believe it believe in right hello I'm Liz Hayes thanks for watching to keep up with the latest from 60 minutes Australia make sure you subscribe to our Channel you can also download the 9 now app for full episodes and other exclusives 60 minutes content
7CZS9lYYOWk,"Michael Stoopman, Medical Cannabis Advocate, Australia",2019-05-18T00:58:30Z,"thank you yeah the video is basically about a journalist for a few minutes talking about why there's prohibition and it's always about following the money a long time ago hemp was the number one cash crop in America and some gentleman by the name of Arlington was tasked with cleaning up the drug scene in America and was basically about cocaine and heroin and things like that and they lumber put into that marijuana and and then they were approached by some very wealthy people who had interests in the polyester and cotton industries DuPont and in growing trees for pop newspaper and tissue paper and toilet paper and they approached him and said look you know if you've got a lumber you got to put in two you got a lump hemp into the banned substances and we said it was no danger in a hemp it's our biggest cash crop you said well you know a hemp plant can theoretically become a marijuana plant or start growing a whole lot of THC in it so you got to include that and it's all the same species that cannabis cannabis species so you lump it in there and here's a lot of money for advertising the advertising that came out was very politically incorrect I won't go into some of it because it could be very offensive but this lady here of course is a person now that could be completely influenced by marijuana and has become a second-rate citizen and the advertising got a lot worse than that and it's not exactly a police problem I'm hearing a lot about the police the police basically have to follow the law that's been created by politics and politicians so they their job is to to do that and if they do it reasonably that's great if some leaders in the police force want political gain and points they organize a raid possibly so and basically that's it I mean that's a bit of a joke you know is there a plant in there but that's about it but if you start compare us comparing what is legal what is illegal and you all know this mostly the effects of marijuana which is illegal is very peaceful you know the North American Indians used to when their Braves had a fight with a neighboring tribe used to the elders used to get them together a sit in a tent supposedly and pass a peace pipe which is full of marijuana and if you hire marijuana is what a hug and love everybody you don't want to do any more damage so that was their way of helping you know violent situations now forgive me for this slide because it says CBD and THC are the same species now what I mean by that is that CBD which comes from predominantly from the hemp plant and from the marijuana plant to some degree and THC which comes to marijuana plant and from the hemp plant are the same species that just like Great Danes and chihuahuas are canines they're very different kind of dogs and CBD and THC and their pure form are different in the way they act on a human being the thing that is interesting about these products is that in it was really the late 80s but early 90s in Israel Muslim discovered that the the marijuana plant and the hemp plant affected the endocannabinoid system it discovered something called the endocannabinoid system which wasn't there around didn't know about it before we know that the vascular system is the biggest system in the human body and then when they discovered the endocannabinoid system they were stunned because every cell has these multiple receptors that they didn't realize were there and they were called the endocannabinoids because of in she was discovered that by their surprise that cannabis activated these receptors or clean them up it's basically also produced a mother's breast milk and then it disappears again to a large degree we're talking mainly about something it looks like cannabis oil and the sorry the endocannabinoid system a year and a half ago we thought it was just on cells multiple receptors on cells it was just recently discovered and each cell is like a combustion engine each cell has a cell membrane which has a millivolt charge creating heat let's say and food and oxygen come in to combust so fuel oxygen and heat are required for combustion and each cell has something on an average 1.3 trillion microcon drea and these micro conduct has recently been discovered that they have an endocannabinoid receptor as well which is amazing so this endocannabinoid system is rife through the whole body and when we when we look at this and how it interacts with the body the the things that activate these cells and these receptors are required for the proper function in the body to bring it into homeostasis into balance so to do this and this is a bit crude but they'll think about an endocannabinoid receptor being parked up by toxins and that's what we eat what we drink what we think or we place in our skin and they get plucked up by other things like pharmaceuticals so it's like a bright light that you can work with do your projects with and then someone's hit a dimmer switch it can't work effectively that's sort of like what happens to the end or no endocannabinoid receptors so what's CBD and THC do Loosli is clean that up so these receptors are firing properly so when I say that CBD and THC cures nothing people go oh I said no but that's the fact it's actually the body that fixes itself when it's being enabled to by the polishing up of these receptors so the thing these slides are a little bit our order my fault this is talking about hemp and how hemp can save the world Henry Ford you know built a car hemp and it was 12 times lighter and 10 times stronger than steel how's that possible it's a plant well carbon fibers if you look at Formula One racing cars that smash into walls all that's left is this cage and they walk out that's all carbon fiber so it's light and it's strong it can be used for building products and incredibly strong and insect resistant it's got a great thermal properties so everything should be built out of that I believe clothing of course lasts 10 times longer than cotton for example the big ban on plastic bags just make him out of hemp so the nature of this product can change the way the world operates so the old companies hate it because you can create a lot of oil out of hemp for fuel so Henry Ford then he made the car most of the car out of hemp he also fueled it with hemp oil so the steel industry wasn't very impressed in the oil industry isn't very impressed and for some reason he never built another one so future building products 300 gallons which is what about 1300 1400 liters of oil this is another problem of course is other clothing materials use a lot of piller pesticide which is now dachshund and PCB are right around the world you've got to go 100 metres 100 feet I should say beneath Antarctica to find that there's none of it now dr. Mattei i come i'll come back to him in a minute a little bit later down the track when we're talking about cancer he is a Japanese doctor that had stumbled across a way of freezing water and looking at its crystalline structure he was really doing it for blood and when they only was testing the equipment and he used water he was very surprised that the water coming out of his tap had a very ugly crystalline structure and the water in his water bottle which had a bit of Japanese calligraphy on it which might have said happiness or love was like a snowflake it was pristine and he was puzzled by this and he discovered that a human thought can change the crystalline structure of water very quickly and when around looted lakes with 100 people or so and holding hands and giving positive vibes to the water and so the water change from a very ugly crystalline structure to pristine so human thought is very very important when it comes to affecting water and I'll come back to that and cancer in a minute because there's a lot of water in human beings so CB now is recognized as the world's greatest anti-inflammatory there's been so many clinical trials done so it just needs to be properly available to everybody and it's it's just a plant the oils should just be a liter in Coles wool was how thee you know when it comes to CBD may be THC should be available through pharmacy now when we talk about cancer last year the Australian Government said 50 percent of Australians are gonna get cancer so I'm one of the fifty so somebody's sitting next to me is okay so if you look around you in the room how many people would that be and they said that thirty eight percent will die from it now back in 14 or 15 it was 34 percent so the numbers are creeping up it costs the Australian Government about a million dollars per patient cancer patient now when I talk about cannabis costs I'm talking about underground cannabis yeah I've heard figures bandied around last year around 1200 to 1500 scripts have been written last she the Minister for Health Mark Hunt was very proud to say look what we've done you know we've got at that time he said a thousand scripts have been written and aren't we helping people well you know that's that's a drop in the bucket if 50 percent of Australians are going to get cancer that's about 12 million people so what's a thousand or 1500 or 2000 scripts gonna do so people have to go underground because the the getting a script is very difficult and then what do you get I'll come to that in a moment now cannabis a good quality cannabis with other factors can mitigate cancer for around you know four and a half to five and a half thousand dollars so I'm going to talk about why I'm here I suppose a lot of people have used me and my pictures as a poster boy from the effects of medicinal cannabis and my story basically he was I had a little red spot on my forehead I couldn't fix and I thought I'd better have a look at this at that time I believed you couldn't get can't see more black solve it was illegal still is I believe so I had a biopsy down a little tube with teeth that pulled out a little skin plug and that was sent away and I came back as a squamous cell carcinoma and what that looked like in three sorry in four to six weeks it grew to a large area so we we invaded the cancer and it went ballistic and it had to be cut out so if you've got any kids the room now the pictures are gonna get worse because once you cut into a cancer you can seed it and generally it can go into many places but the lymph system is a toxic waste dump for human beings it accumulates all the waste and that waste is generally toxic because it's acidic so dr. otto warburg discovered the cause of all cancers which is basically that it's caused by anaerobe ism or lack of oxygen which is caused by an acidic condition caused by toxins which can come from your thoughts from what you drink and eat and breathe and all that sort of stuff so that's the progression of cancer so to fix cancer you've got to fix the toxins and the acidity and get oxygen there cancer is not the enemy it's the last resort of a human body because if cancer cells aren't activated at a site where there is no oxygen all those cells die in that area and they can fall out of your body or in your body and cause bigger problems so there this is loose right but the cancer cells are activated form their own community they don't need oxygen right they need refined sugars and it'll keep growing until they hit oxygen so they're in a membrane if you pierce that membrane through a biopsy or an operation other cells can move around and seed into the rest of the body which is what happened to me so they cut it out of my 4head and then the on the right slide you can see a lump started to grow on the left side of my neck which was my lymph node increasing and it grew and it opened up and it grew the issue was of course the danger was that it could eat in my carotid artery and kill me very quickly and that's what it did on May the 9th Monday May the 9th 2016 I woke up and I was blood coming out of my bandage which shouldn't have happened and I was bleeding out of my carotid artery raised to emergency and they looked at me and they three surgeons looked at me with an intense light they said we can actually see your carotid artery it's diseased we can't do anything for you can't even operate you'll bleed out on the table so what are you suggesting I said well have you got your fears in order I said yes so how long have I got Mae said minutes to maybe hours increase some blood pressure sneeze a cough a movement or a laughs we'll just bursted opening visibly doubt so that was interesting news and I have helped people with kids for about 38 years basically by getting my head fixed and their diet fixed and I had researched all different kinds of products and different evidence-based modalities and tried them for a few years sometimes I could halt my cancer sometimes I got rid of my biggest rumor at that point which was a three and a half centimeter chairman a little baby one was left and I had a and when I had a little baby one left about four or five mil I had a traumatic family experience and very stressful and that little four and a half centimeter tumor grew into that size in about five six months and so that's how quickly it can go so I was diagnosed originally in October 14 I was given 6 to 12 months and I said radical surgery followed by radiation they wanted to cut this whole site open take everything out flesh tissue go through three nerves one will which would have affected my tongue and how I could speak and which is very serious for me so and the other one would affect you know the blood supply then have supplied to the left shoulder and I wouldn't have any functioning there the other one would have given me a general palsy and the left side of my face and the minimum time I would live after an operation like that OB two weeks in hospital another five weeks recovering then six weeks of radiation the minimum time because I asked these questions was two months people died two months after this operation and they are happy to say that you know their average is five years and I asked about six seven years we don't for head and neck cancers have survival after seven eight years but I know from my experience that you know this may not be the case so I rejected that and when you tell a doctor I'm not doing what you're telling me to do they take personal offense right their knowledge is threatened and they don't want to assist you much from there which was another story in itself so just before I started to bleed out a week before I and a friend of mine we independently research what's the best medicinal cannabis that was my last resort I couldn't get it legally I had to go illegal but to save your life this is what you do so I discovered a grower and a manufacturer and a processor that did it I believe the right way and all the evidence showed that and I acquired that product acquiring that product wasn't easy I communicated with the hemp embassy here and a lovely gentleman by the name of Michael who I now know was Michael Balder stone sent me an email and said you know this is I'll put you on to a guy and that guy was importer of this great CBD and in northern rivers and a friend of mine got it from them because I couldn't do much and brought it to me so I only started taking it in hospital and I'm supposed to be dying right and I ended up and they injected me to ease my passing with 520 milligrams of morphine intravenously now that's a huge amount if you've got to have an operation you might have a hundred hundred and ten maybe a hundred twenty milligrams depending after the operation for pain and then they reduce it very quickly and after a few days you can't get anymore because it becomes very addictive so it was nearly a month in hospital and I came out with this box they called a driver pumping morphine and some other drugs into me and because the body is just totally addicted to it get rid of the cancer was a lot easier than getting rid of the morphine so the what I started taking medicinal cannabis which was on and off my family and friends said to me you take your oils today and I was a bit dazed to be honest and surprised I was alive after 24 hours which I shouldn't have been and I had some great head of Nursing and palliative care trying to fix this wound and fix the trying to contain that artery from bleeding out and lovely people anyway so as I said nearly after a month I came out and with a morphine addiction and the tumor kept growing for about four and a half months while I was on medicinal cannabis and I'm finding helping people for the last number of years tumors have a tendency to still grow until the entourage effect happens when the CBD and THC are allowed to get into the body for a long time and if you have the right mindset and diet and everything else it'll halt it and then reduce it and the issue was of course is that this large fungating tumor when I said and and I look at this right-hand picture that's the cleanest the wound was there would have been about a glass full of exudate or crap coming out of that daily that's dead cells and dead cancer cells and my own tissue coming out and that CBD in action externally internally you can't see it of course so that wound on the right there was as clean as a garden at this point I believe my cancer was gone because purple inflammation wherever that went cancer went and it reduced back to that and the wound started looking very clean so every two weeks a doctor used to come out and have a look at me and he said okay yeah we don't know if the cancers gone Michael but what we what we will do is we have to close that wound up I said what do you mean you're gonna do a skin graft he said yep so we take two bits out of your butt two moon shapes and put it on there stitch it all in place and I said no and he said to me look Michael I know you've said to 34 doctors know about what should be done but this is different that was all about cancer this is now about closing up a wound if you don't do that it's gonna take at least three months for that wound to close up and it's going to you know the tremendous scarring you won't be able to turn your head one way or the other way and again I said no and he said look I know you've said this to over 34 doctors but and I never said that I said no I don't want to go down that pathway he said you've said you know over to over 1,300 years of medical expertise you said no to and all these people point the bone at you there's no survival you're gonna die but please let us operate on you he said but this is necessary and again I said no he said why I said well logically I'm on 520 milligrams of morphine no an ethicist in the country's ever put anybody under with that mind of morphine in their system ah but they know what they're doing I said I talked to Australia's biggest addiction expert a medical expert in Canberra they were astounded I was alive and had that much morphine and yet you know and being operated on I'm putting on a general aesthetic is is risky because it has never been done before with that kind of morphine so the risks are too high I said you know I've survived this now I don't want to die on an operating table which is doctors will tell you what the safest places to be so because they could all this resuscitation equipment and everybody that can bring you back hopefully so they has what it's told me so it is funny me to think about it but here and you know you tell a doctor no they feel personally that you're not respecting them so I generally if I make a joke it eases the tension and I've met use this joke before but I'll do it again when you have the skin grafts put on your neck and it all heals up and then you have a friend kiss you or nuzzle you on the neck that they're kissing you by dampe they're kissing your ass so when I said that they are relaxed and okay it's not telling you anything which is not true I'm dumb I'm a dumb bug you tell me anything I know I'll be interested right so they I didn't do it in one month that wound the next day or so after that picture there the one on the right it hyper granulated I don't think I've got any pictures on the screen here but it went red in the tissue and cells started to grow and started to close up and it closed up in one month they were just astounded and the thing is and I didn't take anything on the surface now I know I could atomized some CBD maybe THC and other things on the surface of the wound to help the healing because I've had injuries since then and putting a bit of CBD in for a few days amazing the results on healing and things like that so I didn't know that at the time I still taking it under the tongue sublingually and one month had closed up and that was a big surprise to everybody so I think I've yeah then it took me seven months to every two weeks to reduce my morphine the smallest amount to get rid of my morphine addiction and every single time you reduced it by a small mat you're going through withdrawals so my heart goes out to people that are on opioid addiction or any addiction and they've got to stop it because even though your mind my mind said I can do anything I can stop is I can just go cold turkey forget it ended up in the hospital from withdrawals so I went to the smallest amounts and it took seven months and every time I reduced it I was going through withdrawals now at the end of October when this cleared up and the wound closed up which was early November they sent me away and I was at that time staying in you guys have come from Brisbane to stay with a friend in UK to either live or die in a great environment great energy great food and I was sent to the tween hospital for MRIs because they couldn't do them in woollen bar and the MRI showed and the other scans showed and cat scan everything showed that I was clear of cancer so I have cancer protocols that I have had in the past and now of course since the use of medicinal cannabis that's sort of changed and in order of importance to get the mind right so I have a few few things that I discuss with cancer patients about that and one of them of course is how do you get trauma everybody that has cancer as an underlying anger or trauma or something going on that needs to be repaired and they're thinking because a thought every thought affects electrons in our body electrons have a plus 50 to minus 50 charge so you could be on the right alkalizing diet and if your thoughts aren't corrected won't necessarily become alkaline in your body because the electronic charge so thoughts affect that so thoughts are very important on a molecular base on a molecular level to get help with the emotions I'm always suggesting someone to download or to buy the book The Four Agreements I'm told that by Julie that it's available on YouTube quite often and these four agreements are a way to cover up eudicot ignore what's happening your life see if you had a trauma 20 years ago it wasn't 20 years ago it was a second ago when you thought about that trauma you relive it your body goes through fight-or-flight response adrenaline can be you know generated and things like that and that adrenalin and cortisol has to be dissipated by action if you don't run away or exercise it's it's your body and can become causes acidity so stress is very very impactful on people and they used to say it was 70 percent of illness then they went 80 percent of illness 19 now 90 five ascended illnesses stress-related they claim so The Four Agreements is away a formula for happiness if you read it or listen to it from the narrator which is takes about an hour and 14 minutes it's absolutely brilliant and it should be taught in primary schools for a way of changing the world to a loving and happy world the fifth agreement is even better and also I get people now to look at using the hard math Institute's system for mitigating anger and stress and that is a little device that clips in your ear it measures your heart rate so what it measures the amplitude of the heartbeat and the different heartbeats it measures the variability between the heartbeats and it puts all this in a very clever algorithm and Bluetooth that to a app called inner balance and that's a very sophisticated app and it gives you feedback on how your emotions and thoughts are progressing your stress levels and they put your body into high coherence if you follow their system which is basically a visualization breathing system but you can see live on the screen on your phone or your pad or your computer how things and what the waves are doing and you can modify and and improve your performance all the time so those two things are very important to get the mind right I also know a top-notch psychologist in Australia their travels all over the country and trauma sites she's also an acupuncturist and people can hook up with them via Skype or by audio and is one of the most experienced people in helping people's mind and emotions these are things that are necessary not just for the patient but for the family around and it's not just about recovering from cancer it's the aftermath of cancer that is also important to look at and we don't have time to get into that today so fix your gut health it's very important when you drink you know chlorinated water some places that also has fluoride these things kill bugs and you have a lot of these bugs in your gut biome to break down the final stages of food so I can pass the bear get into your bloodstream as energy so vitamins and minerals etc so if your gut isn't working properly that's a very crucial in cancer you've got to be able to get that working properly I took the the least-expensive where you need a large range of bacteria so if you go to a chemist or health food shop maybe you can buy probiotics that have three or four different kinds the most I've seen is about 13 it's about a hundred and nine dollars a bottle you're going to need several of those in a month so the cheapest at least expensive ways like water kefir which is a bacteria that you put sugared water into the bacteria feeds of all the sugar takes the sugar out and leaves around 25 different kinds of probiotics and also see q10 so that's the least expensive way to have you know a glass a day of probiotics you need an alkalizing dyed no refined sugar so even oncologists agree stay away from refined over sugar right but they don't know of course the cancer loves cheese and meat anything that creates acidity and just because a product is alkaline before it enters your body doesn't mean the body's gonna react to that so you can have a glass of orange juice and a glass of lemon juice when you test them for a city or pH that both acidic almost the same level you drink orange juice the molecular sugar structure of orange juice creates acidity in your body the structure of lemon you drink lemon juice becomes alkaline ash in your body so two products that are both acidic act very differently and even alkaline products become very acidic so all animal products become very acidic someone said to me well what about fish actually fish on the food chain is absorbs the most toxins so you don't want toxin if you've got cancer you don't want toxin anyway so a few years ago in Sydney Harbor the Environmental Protection Agency checked the health of Sydney Harbor they catch a few things and test them fishing there had signature radiation from Fukushima so doctor Almonte whose picture I had before is said to fix the radiation in Fukushima yes plant hemp because Heather is an amazing absorber of toxins and converts it and puts nitrogen back in the soil and it's a great purification device so the whole planet just used hemp for building for fuel for medicine for paper and and toilet paper and plastic bags and it's extremely strong anything that's made out of hemp like you can have a ceramic bowl if you had a serving bowl you threw it in the ground and shatter and break you do that to a hemp bowl only is it lighter but it won't break it'll just look at you to say what did you just abuse me like that so they is it's an amazing product and the whole world should just have it everywhere so detoxing every day is important a far infrared sauna helps bring the toxins to the surface of your skin it's operates at a much lower temperature than SWE's sauna and there's nowhere near as stressful just make sure your sauna sauna sauna doesn't have any emi electrum attic radiation from the heaters there's a lot now claiming they don't have any I've tested one and it didn't have any now a wiggle machine as I call it or as ng machine is a device where you're lying down you're putting your ankles on it and moves from side to side why is this good for everybody while it's very relaxing - it sends blood of going right to the periphery - you'll find capillaries everything gets flooded with blood it moves your vertebrae around and your organs around allow space between them for healing it also moves your lymphatics so some cancer patients find it very hard to exercise so even walking so this device on is it relaxing which is very important it also boosts toxins Ardea lymph nodes it's another benefit from it and the important thing also is when Julie and I visit cancer patients or locations we test their house for looking around for toxic things also looking for electromagnetic radiation which is part of the next bandwagon I'm going to talk about okay we're talking about the right product right oils so in in Queensland for example if you were given a script you're beginning a CB that the queensland government got in from Canada Canada's number one company there make a very good quality CBD but the one they bring in is too weak to be of any benefit it's about eight times weaker than the one I recommend and doesn't seem to have any effect on anybody in New South Wales you'll get a product depending and those products will contain things like antifreeze which might be scary but it's being used in a number of products before but it's not a great thing to put into a body it's got other products in it and it's meant to be a mouth spray so a lady rang me up and said you know we've got a script Michael and I greater said yes great what are you what is your scripts you know what's in it so much sure send me a picture so I Julie looked it up and said I'll wait a minute they want to put this spray into a syringe or into a capsule but the gentleman had rectal cancer and she wanted to stick that up his rectum and said what do you think because they've been taking the product before sublingually and sometimes putting it in the rectum and and Julie said to me well it's got ethanol in it which is used as a dispersant for medicinal cannabis under the tongue because it makes it enter those fine capillaries quite well and it has peppermint oil to make the taste better it has antifreeze and a number of other products now if you've got lesions in your bomb or a puritan in your Bob whatever and you've got these are open lesions are you to put peppermint oil on them you'll be screaming if you were putting ethanol alcohol on it you'd be screaming if you were to put antifreeze on it so if you were to put this up your rectum I don't know how long it would take for it to settle down at how many coffee enemas you would need to settle it down so these are some of the dangers of not looking and having experts discuss what's required and what products are required so in some places you will get a government provided script which has CBD and THC in it together so the issue with that is CBD medicinal CBD has a very low percentage like sometimes point three of a percent of THC which is the socket Rafic element of marijuana let's say or THC and some people are very very susceptible to the effects of THC so you you can dose CBD quite safely and the THC you bring up slowly just to find out at first how sensitive they are to it and they can take up to a month to get used to it for some patients so you want them separated and some scripts will give you CBD and THC together and I've known people to take it then they go home I don't like this feeling I'm out of control I'm not taking that again so they push it aside and some of the products being provided synthetics so some large medical pharmaceutical companies for example don't want to get plantations of of cannabis and then refine that and extract it and that's an expensive process so we can synthesize it when we think of the active components and give it to you and body you've got your CBD and THC only problem is synthetic CBD THC does what other things do plaques up your receptors it makes things worse so you want to what we call a whole of plant extract that's broad spectrum and the way you do that is if you you get the plants in the right environment that don't have any toxins or toxic air so it has to maybe be under glass even though outdoors is better but if you're in a clean area with no air pollutants that's fine outdoor but if you're not you need to keep it under glass you need to filter your air get the right breezes going the right species of plant and you got to harvest them at the right time to get consistent product and there's one place in the world that does that and the importer here also supplies some of it to the hemp embassy so that's CBD I'm talking about and with with with getting the right product you've got the best chance for CBD to work THC is pretty simple if you want THC you know you're after you know how to do that from the marijuana plant and the cradles you get a tincture out of it the strength is very important I've had people to ring me up and say I'm taking 20 drops of THC at night and it's not doing much for me I nearly fell off my chair because the stuff's I talk about and advocate for that THC via 20 be on your back for three days and not moving so it depends you know people say I need a gram of THC a day you know really a gram of what kind of THC oh look I need a mil of CBD that what kind you know I can have a glass of water you know a beer glass of water a beer glass of vodka they're both clear they both have the same volume almost the same densities but one acts very different to the other so the dosing and strength of product and the viability of product extremely important so it's been a bit of a hit miss thing now there's a lot of clinical trials that are happening around the world on these products so you know and this is maybe you're on a date so six years ago less than 300 and in the last few years 15 thousand and a half them are on cancer and a third of them have been peer-reviewed a double-blind studied and crossover studied and published so when I end up sometimes in a meeting with an oncologist or more and now because patients are scared of the oncologist right they you know they said it's no clinical proof all you have to do is go to your own journals your own website you'll find heaps of trials that have been done and some of the more interesting ones we had a brain tumor patient whose lesions now disappeared and one of the things that they reported was that now it's 14 months ago but they had the tests done 12 months apart the endocrinologist was looking at this lady's bone density which is very poor she at osteoporosis so a year on CBD THC and the endocrinologist said there's something wrong with this latest report and latest report because one is showing you know osteoporosis Dillman's showing the 55% recent bone density in fact you don't have osteoporosis anymore one of these two reports is wrong come back in a week fear in view if in two weeks they were getting a yearly infusion and we'll do another infusion for your osteoporosis but the doctor rang the patient up and said you don't need it those reports are correct we don't know how you did it but you've got bone density now in january/february shear I got a report from Canada stating that they'd done clinical trials double-blind studies on osteoporosis just with CBD alone and a dramatically increased bone density so this is one of the great saviors for people with osteoporosis so that there's so many things are being discovered at this these products help to keep up with it is very difficult sometimes so you say yeah nine drops of CBD and THC will be good for you up to 30 drops each depending on the viability of the product you're getting so United States we just heard recently an international cannabis symposium and in a March that 80% of the CBD United States is toxic got auxins it's a huge figure so that's not the average around the world it's less than that but that's pretty high still so you don't want to put toxins in when you have cancer so I want to say a couple things but if I go on my last topic which is EMR electromagnetic radiation nimman saved my life and nimman directly or indirectly is saving thousands of people's lives across this country because it was the best you know for keeping marijuana and hemp going and the importer of this particular CBD doesn't you know do Scripps because it's Underground a they through their advocates and their independent suppliers treat around five to six thousand people a week that's a huge difference to 1000 to 1500 patients in one year through the legal system so we need to you know we don't need to do any more research on cancer you can keep on doing and throw money at it and waste it the best thing forward is to get the mind fixed get the thoughts fixed and then get the right CVD in THC get the right diet right probiotics detox relax de-stress have your family around you support you or your friends very important to fixing cancer so the this particular program there's about three documentaries made that this one sort of starts were like a little bit of conspiracy theory and then it goes into facts and doctors and researchers talking about electromigration the impacts on human bodies so we we don't really have five G yet we have a couple of trial places in this country it's about 20 times stronger than 4G and and 5g is not the issue yet our normal Wi-Fi a normal electronic radiation is the issue and when we go into a cancer patients workplace or their home we have an acoustic meatus very simple box not cheap but does everything including 5g and we can monitor where the hot spots are and what to do so if I turn this on in this hall you'll see if you can see it to red indicators and I got a readout on the average if I go here if I go here and here you get these readouts that doing analog and digital the right is the average so when it's green it has no impact the radiation has no impact on plants and small bodied animals and things like that when it's orange of course it does and humans are affected when it goes into the orange scale and it affects them in different many different ways if you go into red of course you're getting toxic exposure there's not one place we've been where the Wi-Fi is on and other things are happening where it isn't high in the red in fact we've been to people's marketplaces and they use a microwave and we put a bit of water and it turn it on you want to run out of the room because all the signals are top read from new and old microwaves there's no shielding you from it and 5g and that kind of radiation is used by the military as a weapon it's used in some places for crowd control because a minute exposure to those intense waves will give you brain fog subdue you you won't think clearly there's all kinds of things that happen when you are exposed to that kind of radiation so there is this four basic kinds major ones and in this space okay so in this arena there's all different kinds that are out there the thing about it is you know it starts to affect us at point zero zero to five milliwatts per meter and it goes up there I don't know if you can see these slides but basically at eight is it 806 our DNA has come as damaged so anything down from there affects all car the kinds of diseases so there's been many reports and many research much research done and the safety standards that have been accepted I was set by communication engineers which says anywhere between four hundred to two thousand milliwatts per square meter is safe now nothing operates that high as 400 so 5g is way underneath that so is 4G says your Wi-Fi and everything else so it's like a government body saying this is the safe limits and we're not reaching that zero K which is not the case because if you look at some of these documentaries and some of the research that has be done it'll indicate to you that none of it's safe so what can we do to mitigate it okay so you there are paints you can put on your house that reflect it there are cloth materials made out of these particles that will reflect it you can wear it as a t-shirt or a hat there's all kinds of people out there trying to make money out of it plugging a product into a wall to mitigate the side effects of EMR electric radiation if that worked your Wi-Fi wouldn't work you sell your phone wouldn't work in your house and maybe electricity would don't work so it's not working too well there is a product in Russia there's about 1.3 million tons of this products called shoe guide and shoe guide will block EMR but you need a large area I mean I wear a little piece or I my neck - maybe blocks some of the radiation coming into my body but it's not big enough it will block it though so there's very little we can do except for turn off those products the communication companies around the world to their shareholders say that things like you know the risks to this business is litigation we can't get insurance because insurance companies won't insure us if Sony wants to sue us for getting ill or having cancers because of our equipment so the insurance companies are a wake up and that's across not just AT&T which is one of the largest but right across everything so BMI yes sir doesn't say Michael time to wind up can you can you tell us sir what the reading was on that machine in here dangerous sorry I'll turn the noise down and I'll point it over here so people can see we the left-hand side is a peak radiation the right hand side is the average they're both way in the red so here and you use this device in all different direction so I look over here I'm getting an orange peak but a red average if I look over here I'm getting orange and a red peak average over here you have Wi-Fi in this room somewhere it's off yeah turn it on so we're looking over here we're in the Reds this one's probably from cellular towers or that chemical radiation it'll take a minute to fire up and we'll see what level it goes to when I pointed at that area but everywhere we go Wi-Fi just sends everything through the roof and one of the things you can do if you want to experiment that's what that's art okay look it's picking up almost to the top when I look over here in the red right it's it's going very high so right over here sounding like a Dalek yeah we look over here and I can't do it so I do hear it's really high yeah they all do this here we've got the some other Wi-Fi here as well okay so turn it off at night when you're going to sleep definitely okay well Michael um have you got a few closing words to say we probably won't do questions cuz we've got to keep moving on thing and what would suggest is Michael will be spending some time here I'm sure after the talk even out here on the veranda and if you want to speak to him personally please go ahead thanks Nick thank you very much thanks thank you

n9oSvqmxj9c,Australia&#39;s First Medicinal Cannabis Trial To Treat Tourette&#39;s Syndrome,2019-04-07T09:20:35Z,Australian researchers have jumped through incredible hoops to get their hands on a controversial drug now they have it our first medicinal medicinal cannabis trial is underway and the world is watching even afternoon tea with mum and dad is tiring for Chris Wright the 31 year old has been battling Tourette's for more than 20 years every day becomes almost like Groundhog Day you wake up and you know that the day is going to be painful it's gonna be frustrating and it's going to be exhausting the syndrome causes uncontrollable verbal and physical tics you know his own ended up leaving school early because I was getting bullied a lot we remember him when he was in the early stages just to must knock himself out it's so scary when you're first diagnosed but in the palm of their hands Australian researchers may hold a magic oil medicinal cannabis what we think it might do is modulate some of the neurotransmitters involved in the brain of individuals with Tourette syndrome Chris is the first of 24 patients needed for the five-month clinical trial the research team already going to extraordinary lengths all my goodness is probably easier to deal with plutonium than cannabis you know virus actually comes from Switzerland Sydney University flambéed Institute has teamed up with Wesley medical research experts who felt compelled to act and many of my patients were coming to me and saying these drugs that we we've got for Tourette's they're just not really working or they have terrible side effects about 12 different medications over the course of about a year a few of them put me in hospital but could this simple drop on the tongue change everything in this oil is a reduced amount of THC that's the molecule that gets you high but cannabis has more than 500 bioactive molecules it's a virtual nature's treasure trove I think it's a very interesting time we're realizing that cannabis is very complex one really important point is that you don't necessarily have to get stormed in order to enjoy the therapeutic effect let's actually do the science here and work out is this really a treatment that helps it's safe with the love of his family Chris says it's already delivered a bit of hope I think hopes the biggest thing for the people out there who are really suffering then yes it's worth pursuing let's do it Ali Donaldson for 10 news first

wK1L4ESJeIM,Medicinal cannabis access for consumers,2020-09-25T01:26:19Z,"So you’ve heard about medicinal cannabis. Maybe you’re wondering if it's right for your condition. Speak to your doctor about your health concerns. Your doctor will consider treatment options… and they may decide that a medicinal cannabis product is suitable for your needs. Most medicinal cannabis products are not approved medicines in Australia. This means the Therapeutic Goods Administration (or TGA) has not assessed them for safety, quality or effectiveness. But sometimes there are no approved medicines that meet a patient’s needs. That’s why any doctor can apply to the TGA for special access to unapproved medicines such as medicinal cannabis. They’ll hear back within two business days. Some doctors have applied to become Authorised Prescribers, which means they don’t need approval from the TGA for each individual patient. If your doctor gives you a prescription for a medicinal cannabis product, you will need to take it to a pharmacy. Medicinal cannabis products aren’t stocked in most pharmacies, so your pharmacist may need to order it in. You should also know that medicinal cannabis products are not subsidised through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; the supplier sets the cost. Beware of buying online. You could break the law and get an unsafe product. Legal access to medicinal cannabis means getting a prescription from your doctor and filling the prescription at your pharmacy. If you have any questions, speak with your doctor. You can also find out more on the TGA website."
i5vS30AFLE4,Inside the burgeoning black market for medicinal marijuana | 7.30,2020-02-19T00:30:03Z,after I graduated high school obviously with my condition I wasn't sure whether I was ever going to be able to work kind of a standard normal jobs for much of his life Brent our Curie has relied on medication to manage his painful bowel condition called Crohn's disease it affects the lower half of my small intestine and what it does is it causes a lot of information and causes it to deteriorate over time every day I wake up I have some sort of pain purely due from eating food it can cause me to be very fatigued but nothing seemed to give the twenty-year-old from the Gold Coast the relief he needed until he tried cannabis oil all it is is just you put two jobs underneath your tongue and you let it sit there for about ten to fifteen seconds and then you usually just once to twice a day depending on how I'm going yeah and there's no psychoactive effects the way I can feel the effects is when I feel like medicinal cannabis was first legalized across the country in 2016 with the approval of the Therapeutic Goods Administration GPS can prescribe cannabis oil to their patients but even though brent has been through that process he simply can't afford to fill the prescription I was very lucky I have a specialist he wrote in a really good letter of recommendation and I was able to get accepted for this medicine but it's only after you get accepted they tell you all the associated costs Brent was paying about $600 a month for cannabis oil prescribed by his GP a cost he says was beyond his means instead he's turned to a surging online black-market for the medicine where he's now paying a quarter of that price it does cause me a lot of anxiety honestly it does because I do think there is still a large stigma based around it at this point and it does make me fear a bit because I could get pulled over at any time and drug tested so that fear is always in the back of my head when I'm driving around yes [Music] but the licensed cannabis industry warns there's no guarantee of purity or safety with black-market products in comparison to growing in a backyard we have complete control over the environment we test every part of the way to make sure there's no contaminants bacteria or mold that's building up in the plant at a secret facility south of Perth a pharmaceutical company farms cannabis to make legal medicinal oil it's one of the first of its kind in Australia after being granted a licence by the federal Health Department we're currently expanding our facility so we'll be able to produce 10 times more bottles than what we're producing now to be able to look after not only the Australian mark demand but also the international markets fleeter solomon acknowledges her company's product is more expensive during part to higher production costs to meet strict regulations we know what price we give to the wholesaler but we don't have any say over what the retailers put so we don't know exactly what the patients are playing at the end but in law here in Australia if I said well let's let's treated as a medical product cuz then it can be made to high quality so yes it adds some cost but it also means that it's quality product given under medical supervision there is currently no subsidy for cannabis products under the pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme the TGA expects this may change but not for some time the situation that we're working towards is for the clinical trial to be done and for companies to put submissions to us but those trials take a couple of years and then they have to get the results and then submit them as they do for any other medicine meanwhile a Senate inquiry is now looking into problems with access and regulation of the industry as a whole I think there's a lot of ways the system could be improved for a lot of Australians it is just simply unaffordable to have costs like that associated with medicine excited for tomorrow yeah in the Melbourne suburb of croy day Emma brown lives with chronic pain after a car accident in 2015 three days later I woke up in hospital and I had a brace on and couldn't move and it's really bad and I just wanted to see my kids in accident the accident left the 35 year old with permanent damage to her spine and unable to work I changed my life in so many different ways and not just the physical obviously it hurts it hurts a lot every day I was less sociable I just sort of found myself not wanting to go in through things because it hurt to do it like Brent our Curie emma was prescribed other pain medications but nothing worked until she tried cannabis she was granted legal access to cannabis oil by a doctor but was simply unable to afford the prescription to look at the price of being on the cannabis oil with your prescription it was approximately five hundred and twenty dollars a month that we have cost me for the product would've ended up costing me over a third of my income approximately my pension to go on this dedication and then black market you're looking at approximately $120 for a 30ml bottle over thousand milligrams or so I yeah to me it's a no-brainer right now I'm not on I currently smoke of an evening just to sort of band-aid the detention in my back I'm not you know I'm not advocating everyone getting stoned being left with no other option but to go black market it does make me feel bad I definitely feel judged both Mr Brown and Brent are Kure hope the Senate inquiry will prompt desperately needed change it's set up so we fail like here it is but you can omit there is no way I can afford that product so where am I left in pain I just don't understand what I would hope is is that it shifts a bit more of the conversation around to this time issue because there's an issue that affects a lot of Australians and it is something that could potentially help millions of more Australians they're just not even aware of it at this point hi I'm Leigh sales thanks for watching this story if you'd like to watch more of 730 stories they are on the left of your screen and tap on the button below to subscribe and

you to our coadlow lecture online this evening i'd like to begin by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land from which we are broadcasting this evening and pay my respects to their elders past present and emerging musculoskeletal australia would like to thank spectrum therapeutics for their sponsorship of this evening's webinar which has enabled us to offer it free of charge it is important to state however that spectrum therapeutics has no editorial influence over the content of tonight's webinar our webinar aims to provide the community with an increased impartial and evidence-based knowledge of medicinal cannabis and its current availability in australia if you haven't previously viewed musculoskeletal australia's website i strongly suggest you do so in line with our focus on empowering consumers through education and support services we have a wide range of information videos webinars tools and services including our national helpline that is available via email and phone on 1-800 263 we also have the information about medicinal cannabis on our website now like to introduce you to mr rob anderson ceo of muscular skill australia to officially welcome you to tonight's lecture thanks jen i would also like to warmly welcome everyone to musculoskeletal australia's 2020 online coadlow lecture this evening the coedler lecture is a free public event that

specialist he has worked in aboriginal health hiv prevention and in the drug and alcohol sector richard is a strong advocate for drug law reform many thanks richard thanks so much and g'day everybody let me first acknowledge uh the traditional owners of the lands on which we all meet right across the country uh and thanks so much for uh inviting me to really give what uh i wanna give a very personal perspective of an issue that i've been involved with for for a number of years so i'm um somebody who trained as a gp uh somebody who worked um in the um area of public health and then moved into politics and and i did that because i i really wanted to address a number of issues that sort of set outside the um you know the sphere of influence you have you have as a doctor i'm not going to give you a technical presentation about the pharmacology of medicinal cannabis or going to great detail about the evidence base and so on you'll probably get a more technical overview from from me you know so i'll leave that to him but what you'll get from me is a sort of broad overview and and um some of the issues around access and and and the regulatory framework and how how that's been managed at the moment so um why does medicinal cannabis actually work it's interesting because when i trained as a medical student um the only real the message i got about cannabis was that it's harmful product um it's illegal uh stay away from it um we didn't even know there was something called the endocannabinoid system that's emerged only recently sort of through the 90s we came to understand that the body has a system which makes its own cannabis like molecules and they help to modulate a range of functions in the body so they become a way of sending messages to different cells in the body and they perform lots of different functions um so it really was as we started to understand more about this endocannabinoid system that we came to understand how cannabis interacted with that and how it actually produced a range of effects some of them are desirable and therapeutic there's an analogy with other drugs like opiates opiates are drugs that our body also makes we make our endogenous version of those drugs when you hear something with the word endogenous it just means our own body makes them and we have receptors which are basically the the part of the body that that those endogenous opiates bind to and that produces a series of responses and that's why drugs like codeine and pathadine and morphine work uh to reduce pain is because they're working on our own natural system uh that helps to modulate uh things like pain so we had an analogy the endocannabinoid system uh was a system that our body has which produces these molecules that are called cannabinoids and they're basically uh similar in structure to the drugs that we now know as medicinal cannabis now we've known for a long time next we've known for a long time that medicinal cannabis is effective and indeed it's cannabis has been used for thousands of years um and there's a long history of use and some of it uh in the case of it's used as treatments um through some traditional cultures and has been for for a long period of time um what we've learned uh over recent years is that the evidence base is now building for a range of conditions but it's important to say the evidence is still contested in some areas is some debate and it's also important to recognize when we talk about evidence sometimes we're having different conversations because within the medical sphere the gold standard for medical evidence is the randomized double-blind trial and we haven't uh had as many of those when it comes to medicinal cannabis uh as we've had for other well-known drugs but what we do know is that there have been other types of studies done as well as double-blind trials which are certainly increasing in frequency now but case studies can actually help us learn about the effect of particular substances of particular uh therapeutic agents so and and we can't dismiss the fact that a drug that has a long history of use many of the sort of unforeseen side effects that we might see with a new drug really aren't an issue there's also the question about what you're measuring when you're talking about the evidence of where the medicinal cannabis works are you talking about the whole plant or are you talking about the uh different compounds within the plant so the plant medicinal cannabis contains a number of different compounds it contains thc which is the substance that can make can alter your consciousness make you high as as it's described this cbd cannabidiol and there are other cannabinoids and indeed other substances within the medicinal cannabis plant and some people argue that it's the interaction of these different compounds that produces its effect and to complicate things further there are different concentrations in different strains of medicinal cannabis plants when it comes to thc cbd and the other compounds so some are high in thc some are low in thc and it depends on the therapeutic effect that you want so what we do know now is that of course sorry to complicate the matter even further is sometimes um we're talking about a medicinal cannabis that's consumed as an edible product because you can eat it but it can also be vaporized and smoked and so when we talk about the evidence we need to be really clear what are we measuring are we measuring the whole plant or are we talking about individual compounds and what's the method of ingestion what's the dosage all of those things are absolutely critical and because there's so much variation in terms of what has been tested if you like what's been assessed the evidence remains in some areas unclear in other areas contested however we do know that for some therapeutic conditions it's of a tremendous benefits the most commonly used or most common reasons for its use are for things like um to prevent nausea and as an appetite stimulant so for example people living with aids found that it worked as an appetite stimulant um as well as preventing the nausea that comes from many of the drugs that people have been provided we know this evidence around muscle spasms and for conditions like ms there's also now evidence but this is a much more complicated picture about its using pain conditions neuropathic pain cancer pain and other forms of pain now many people i'm sure this will be for many people listening of particular interest and i'm sure many of you also know that pain's very complicated because there are so many factors that contribute to the experience of pain but there is little doubt that many patients who do experience severe joint pain for example do find it a very useful addition to their treatment indeed we're now seeing that in some cases it's being worked as a substitute that's been used as a substitute for opiate treatment which carries its own set of problems look it's also fair to say that many of the advocates for medicinal cannabis talk about its properties across a range of areas including as a drug that fights cancer we do know that in vitro in the laboratory setting there might be some evidence that it has an effect but so far in practice uh we haven't seen that and uh and there's much more work to be done before we can say that it has a beneficial effect in that area we know that um it's also a drug that produces side effects now um someone uh once wisely said that there's no such thing as a side effect all drugs have effects uh there are the effects that um are of interest uh to people and if that's the major effect of a drug and it has few of the things we don't want then we call that um a medicine but ultimately all drugs have effects they have a range of effects and medicinal cannabis is no different um apart from some of the things that i described earth earlier in terms of the beneficial properties that we look for preventing nausea and appetite stimulant muscle spasms neuropathic pain of course epilepsy particularly particular forms of epilepsy in very young children we again we know that there is evidence emerging in that sphere as well but we also know that it can cause psychological a psychological response so the thc for some people is a pleasant side effect and indeed it's why it uh it is why we um are so being used as a recreational substance um but of course for others uh that altered state of consciousness can be problematic particularly for high thc preparations it can produce anxiety paranoia and lethargy in some people so um the you know like all drugs there are desirable effects and for some people undesirable effects the question around psychosis which is when i was training as a as a gp um was one that was again contested and it is complicated it doesn't appear that there's any strong correlation we do know that the issue around psychosis uh is as much around the proportion of thc and cbd and in fact the interesting thing here is that cbd which is within the medicinal cannabis plant is now being used or trialled um and there's uh there are some studies underway as a treatment for psychosis so the picture there again is complicated i think one thing to say is of course if you're a young person or got a very strong family history of psychosis it's something that should be avoided unless you have a a thorough consultation with somebody who's very experienced in in the field um in terms of safety uh again um it's it's important to look at this drug relative to other drugs there's no perfect drug some all drugs as i said have a range of effects one of the things about cannabis is there's no overdose potential so people don't die um they don't overdose from uh medicinal cannabis that's a huge positive when you consider that opiates are a major cause of of overdose and indeed in the u.s uh the numbers are upwards of 60 000 people per year who who um succumb so uh that's by no means trivial and and medicinal cannabis simply does not have any overdose potential i mean you can drugs like paracetamol which we think of as very very safe do um are they very safe drugs and take it when taking the right quantities but when taken in the wrong quantities can actually cause very severe damage to the liver so when we compare the harms of medicinal cannabis to other commonly used drugs and particularly its potential for overdose i think it's reasonable to say it's a relatively safe drug so there i was i suppose learning a bit uh learning more about this drug um as as this evidence sort of developed and ian will go into much more detail around the current state of play there but what was very clear to me was here we had medication that was providing benefit to people it was a drug that in terms of relative harms was uh less harmful than alcohol uh alcohol has a range of harms that simply don't exist for cannabis this was a drug that we knew had therapeutic properties and yeah and we also knew that many thousands and i've only learned i suppose through my time involved in this subject how just how many people are accessing it illicitly and being treated like criminals and while that was happening here in australia what we saw around the world was a number of jurisdictions starting to make medicinal cannabis available and so i became increasingly interested in what we needed to do here in australia to provide people with access to this drug knowing that it was of benefit to them and that's where i learned about dan haslam now lucy haslam may be known to some of you if you've been involved in this area for a while but lucy became involved with medicinal cannabis because her son dan was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer as a 20 year old young man one of the problems with his um treatment was he was getting just awful nausea and he was on having chemotherapy as a 20 year old kid he's getting not just nausea after treatment but he his nausea became so bad that he started to get anticipatory noise he would get nauseous even before treatment started just knowing what was coming up he was on some very heavy-duty anti-nausea drugs his mum who was a nurse um and had no experience with medicinal cannabis his father ironically was a a policeman involved in the drug squad they were both recommended medicinal cannabis from someone they gave it to him he got immediate relief and indeed it improved his quality of life immeasurably he started his nausea was under control his appetite came back and tragically he died in his mid-20s but his quality of life was significantly improved yet he was being treated like a criminal and so were many other families who were using it to treat any number of conditions so there i was i suppose in the senate faced with somebody who was uh it was a doctor and had uh an interest in in this area and had been watching the the field from a distance coming to learn about the stories of people who were getting benefit from the drug drug that had been used for many many years knowing that we've now got an endocannabinoid system that that is designed specifically it would seem for this drug to work on us we had gps who are becoming more interested in the field here in australia and yet people were being treated like criminals so the decision that needed to be made is what do we what do we do next what's what what is the way of trying to drive change in this area we weren't seeing it from within the pharmaceutical industry because there were a number of things working against the development of medicinal cannabis as a conventional pharmaceutical drug firstly there's a lot of stigma and controversy associated with its use but most importantly but this uh pharmaceutical companies rely on getting a patent and protecting their intellectual property to justify investment in new drugs so you have to be able to develop a new drug protect that development and you make money off that intellectual property but how do you get a patent for something that's effectively a natural plant that can be grown in a backyard where people can can grow it easily where there's a thriving black market and indeed in some cases we're going to compete against some of the other drugs that you make drugs like opiates for example which have proven to be very very profitable so there are a number of incentives working against the pharmaceutical pharmaceutical industry developing new products there are a couple of products available in australia but they're very expensive and for very limited indications so what we did was have a look at what other countries were doing and they recognized that with medicinal cannabis it had some unique properties in that a it was a plant easily grown illegal but with major therapeutic benefits and so they decided to set up an independent regulator statutory body responsible for regulating the use of medicinal cannabis products in a medical setting and um in many jurisdictions what they've done is said we're going to set up this special expert independent group and regulate it so we developed a bill a piece of legislation that would effectively do the same thing here in australia by way i mean um myself and then recruited uh labour party co-sponsor a liberal party co-sponsor national party co-sponsor and got independence also to agree common sense i think everybody recognized we needed to ensure that people could get access to this product and we took that bill around the country we had a number of senate hearings we worked as i said with politicians from right across the political spectrum and eventually we managed to get enough support that the government decided it would act however what the government decided to do and in retrospect i think it's been a very significant mistake they decided to use the existing regulator for medicines rather than do what our bill had proposed which was set up a standalone independent regulator specifically for medicinal cannabis and what that's meant is that access to medicinal cannabis is still wanting for many people so what the government has done is they've got the existing regulator called the therapeutic goods administration of the tga and what they do is they treat all drugs to be used in australia have to be registered and for them to get registered what usually happens is a pharmaceutical company puts in an application puts in a an evident a dossier of evidence if you like on the efficacy of the drug whether it works the safety manufacturing quality all of those things are done by a pharmaceutical company and a drug that's registered however we know as i've just said with medicinal cannabis pharmaceutical companies weren't lining up to do that and as a result what happened was we've got the current state of play where the tga has said well we're happy to register a product but we need it to be put through by a pharmaceutical company well that wasn't working so what the tga this body that regulates all medicines in australia has decided has has done is they've approved the use of medicinal cannabis only when a doctor requests special permission so there's something that the tga can use that's called the special access scheme it's for any drug that doesn't have registration in australia and that special access scheme if you're somebody with a terminal illness and somebody who's likely to die within six months a doctor can make an application and will get it however if your patient's not in that category a doctor needs to justify to the tga why this drug should be used and why other medicines in australia are not clinically suitable they have to go through a few hoops now once that's done unfortunately in some states there's another layer of bureaucracy that sits over the top of that and there has been some streamlining of that but um only very recently uh what needed to happen was then you needed to get approval from most state jurisdictions so from the perspective of the doctor if somebody comes in and wants to wants to try medicinal cannabis they may have neuropathic pain muscular spasms they may have joint pain the doctor first has to be a doctor that's interested in exploring this area and it's fair to say that there are many older conservative doctors who just simply are not interested and and don't uh accept that it's a legitimate treatment i think most doctors now accept that it has a role but doctors are still firstly finding it hard to access independent sources of education and advice many doctors are rightly skeptical and want until they are able to access that information we haven't got any gold standard for training in australia yet and then even if you do decide that you want to go down the path of prescribing it what you need to do is you need to then put an application into the tga so from the perspective of a doctor you can write a script which could be filled in a couple of minutes or for another drug or you can decide to go down this route which is going to be much more time consuming and it might not be something that you're convinced about anyway or have much experience in just too hard we won't do it so we've got a major problem at the moment with people being able to access it so the um uh the the next issue of course is that we still don't have products in australia that are available um in a way that's affordable for many people products are not subsidized at the moment and because uh they're not registered for use in australia they haven't been through that tga process there's no way of getting a subsidy like the pbs does for many other drugs and so the the many of the preparations are simply out of reach for many people so in light of all of that we had a senate inquiry the senate inquired which i chaired and we looked at what are the things that needed to change and really it's many of the things that i've already touched on already and i'm just looking at the time so i won't go into into great detail but a lot more needs to be done around educating medical professionals and providing them with independent accessible information should they need it and that's a unfortunately something that hasn't been done well the medical colleges many of them don't have the resources or indeed the commitment to want to take this on and um and it's really up to the initiative of individual doctors um the uh senate inquiry also interesting if you're interested in this by the way just google medicinal cannabis a senate inquiry and what you'll get is a an inquiry that there's really only one inquiry it talks about patient access so the piece around educating doctors was recommended they made it very clear that there needs to be an education campaign with the community they also made it very clear that what we should do is provide a pathway for doctors to get the appropriate training and then not have to use the tga approval process it's basically a script that should be written like any other script is written within the clinical setting and interestingly recommendation 5 says if all of this fails what we should do is have a independent regulator because it's clear that the current mechanism for deciding how and when it's used just isn't working and uh and i think we're so that the the the final slide which is where to from here is one that we need um to be i think working in two very distinct areas i think what we have to do is uh make sure that through the medical colleges um with the support of the federal government that we get a an accredited um a training program for gps who are interested in providing it and we do this already there are examples of this already we do this with methadone for example which was a drug that's used for people who are opiate dependent uh if you to become a methadone prescriber uh you do a short course and that allows you to be able to write a prescription uh in a way that uh in in some ways you write them for other drugs well there's no reason why we can't have that with medicinal cannabis and cut the application to the tga out of the equation it will give gps it will give gps some confidence that they need to know that they're up to date with the most recent literature and it would mean that um patients know uh who would who can provide it uh and who has the the knowledge and expertise in this field and i'm hopeful that ultimately we get the vast majority of gp's comfortable uh in ensuring that it is uh prescribed um if that's if i think we're back here uh in the next year and there is still no um advance uh in terms of gps being able to access information and prescribe it easily then i think it's there's no choice for the government but to recognize that this needs an independent regulatory framework and we return to the principle of a independent regulator but let me just finish with this we have a substance that we know alleviates pain and suffering for many many people we have a substance that has no potential for overdose we have a substance that when it's compared to other products that are uh particularly uh prescription medications is far safer and yet uh we have made it much more difficult to prescribe than much more dangerous drugs we have made it very difficult for patients to afford and we've for some of them treated them like criminals and given them criminal records for accessing what is a medicine and that's wrong and it needs to change and it's why i've been involved in the area for a number of years and why i hope to continue to stay involved until anybody who wants to try medicinal cannabis from the perspective of a health condition for which they might get benefit is able to do it easily and affordably that's really what my goal is is here thanks very much for sharing your incredible experience um and knowledge from particularly your time in parliament and and and you know your involvement with the senate inquiry and so on so um and and the fact that you're willing to stay involved in relation to this issue i think is is a wonderful thing i'd now like to introduce professor ian mcgregor ian is professor of psychopharmacology nhmrc principal research fellow and academic director of the lambert initiative for cannabinoid therapeutics in the brain and mind center at the university of sydney australia ian's historical research has focused on the effects of drugs on the brain and behavior and more recently on the discovery and development of new medications for the treatment of disease ian has a strong interest in the area of medicinal cannabis with more than 20 years of experience in cannabinoid research the lambert initiative for cannabinoid therapeutics was formed in 2015 with a gift of unprecedented generosity from the lambert family to the university of sydney the lambert initially aims to fast-track research into the therapeutic benefits of cannabinoids in various disease states and the lambda initiative is also engaged at a social and political level to improve community and professional education around medicinal cannabis and to bring about evidence-based regulatory change and improve patient access so ian i'll hand the microphone and the camera over to you thanks very much ian well thank you very much jane and it's wonderful to be here tonight and thanks for the opportunity to deliver the quad love lecture for 2020 alongside richard and a wonderful job richard i thoroughly enjoyed your talk and congratulations on all the wonderful work you've done in the medicinal cannabis space over recent years it's very much appreciated by patients and scientists alike and just a few disclosures there are mostly around companies whose products we've used for various clinical trials in the medicinal cannabis space i'd really like to start by thanking barry joy lambert who in 2015 gave this amazing gift to the university of sydney to establish the lambert initiative for cannabinoid therapeutics a kind of purpose-built research center for medicinal cannabis at the university of sydney and their story is a very interesting one and it relates to their granddaughter caitlin who suffers from a very severe form of epilepsy called rabbi syndrome and caitlyn was a very sick little girl aged about three her father michael lambert discovered that giving her what was then an illicit cannabinoid product that was sourced from denmark he was bringing it in illegally had a transformational effect on caitlyn's health and she went from having hundreds of seizures a week to having no seizures and essentially turned an incredible corner in terms of her health and well-being and she continues to have quite an incredible trajectory for a child with travis syndrome often they have severe disability moving forward many of them die before adulthood and caitlyn is doing extremely well and continues to do very well on cannabinoid medications and this story was what inspired the lamberts to set up the lambert initiative at the university of sydney by the way michael lambert did appear in court for his sins of um apparent sins of illegally procuring cannabis substances for his very old daughter and that reflects on richard's story that a lot of people are still criminalized for trying to help their loved ones in this space unfortunately barry has gone on to actually take a business interest in medicinal cannabis uh he didn't know much about cannabis in 2015 but has since formed a company called eco-fiber which sells and markets very successfully a range of mostly cbd rich products into the american market and uh i have no opinionary interest with eco fiber but it's interesting how he turned the story into something of an amazing commercial opportunity we are set up in the brain and mind center at the university of sydney we have terrific labs there where we do a whole range of different research projects and have terrific fun actually with a team of mostly very young scientists doing incredible work and our overall theme is to try and develop novel cannabinoid-based therapeutics to help alleviate human suffering it's a very exciting time to be in cannabis research of course cannabis itself is nothing new as a therapeutic as a 6 000 year history and and the current year of prohibition the past 90 years are basically a historical anomaly compared to the rich history that cannabis has as a therapeutic what recent times have taught us is a kind of advanced complexity around this ancient plant we're kind of in the era of cannabis 2.0 we now understand that there's more than 140 different molecules in the plant that we might call cannabinoids most don't actually get you stoned most they're not intoxicating but a lot of them appear to have therapeutic potential and different types of cannabis plants are enriched in different types of cannabinoids there are other bioactive components in the plant which include terpenoids and flavonoids and this plant seems to have a privileged interface with what we call the endocannabinoid system of the brain and body which richard referred to in his talk the endocannabinoid system is an incredible new frontier in pharmacology and physiology we knew nothing about this system 20 years ago and now we're learning a great deal about it there's basically no process in your brain and body that doesn't involve the endocannabinoid system there's a lot to learn about the system but it modulates very basic processes metabolism inflammation psychological processes like anxiety and fear metabolic processes and also heavily involved in disease states as well and we're trying to understand how the endocannabinoid system might change as a result of people being afflicted with various diseases and conditions uh two of the major endocannabinoid molecules and this this is quite technical but it's worth knowing their names amandamide and 2ag these are incredibly important molecules in your body it doesn't matter where we look in the body you'll find endocannabinoids you'll find the endocannabinoid system you'll find the nandamide in 2ag so if you look in skin it's full of endocannabinoids and various proteins that we interact with if you look in the gut then you have endocannabinoids galore there if you look at joints you know for example your knee joint the synovium there's a very complex endocannabinoid system there and this brings forward the idea that if we can modulate the endocannabinoid system and it appears the cannabis plant has privileged access to that system then you can gain a great therapeutic advantage in terms of trying to alleviate disease and suffering we're also using our knowledge of the endocannabinoid system to better understand what are very widely used traditional medicines so we learned recently for example that one of the actions that panadol has not the toxic action on the liver but its effects on on pain and inflammation seems to involve fairly direct modulation of the endocannabinoid system so when you're taking panadol you're actually really taking a cannabinoid not a lot of people realize that um another really interesting thing is that people vary in terms of their endocannabinoid systems this is a fascinating story from scotland my home country of a woman who had a funny genetic mutation which meant that her endocannabinoid system was overactive she had huge concentrations of endocannabinoids in her blood in her brain and her body and they discovered this because she went in to have fairly serious surgery for osteoarthritis and the doctors soon realized that this woman had really severe joint degeneration normally that they associated with a great deal of pain but she seemed to feel no pain from her condition whatsoever and when they probed her surgical history they found that she'd have various dental and other medical procedures it would normally be very painful but she never required any pain relieving medication when she was cooking in the kitchen she'd often burn herself and she'd only realize she was burning herself because she smelled her own flesh burning that's fairly grotesque by the testament to how she felt very little pain and she could eat the hottest of chili peppers without any discomfort when they asked her about anxiety and depression she never feared anything and on scale psychometric skills she scored very low for anxiety and depression what cases like this tell us is that if you have up regulation of the endocannabinoid system you seem to be able to make pain disappear and also alleviate anxiety and depression and that gives us great hope that some of the cannabinoids present in the plant may actually have this direct line to the endocannabinoid system to cause pain relieving and also major effects on anxiety and depression so at the lambert initiative we're trying to deconvolute the plant we're trying to interrogate the actions of these endocannabinoids and without getting too technical i'll tell you that these days a lot of uncovering of interactions between drugs and their targets is done in computers so we do a lot of high-end computational work modeling how cannabinoids interact with cells in the body and their receptors and we also physically do work where we look at these cannabinoid effects on receptors particularly receptors that we know are related to pain and inflammation and epilepsy and other medical conditions we also run a lot of cellular models of disease so we can take cells from the knee for example from patients that have arthritis that show inflammation and we can apply cannabinoids to these cells in a test tube and find out which cannabinoids are best in terms of reducing inflammation we do the same with cancer we kill cancer cells routinely with various cannabinoids and also we have many brains actually from epilepsy patients which show abnormal electrical activity don't worry the brains are conscious but we can use these brains to look at how cannabinoids interact with epilepsy type electrical activity in these brains and we also run animal models we have mice that have the same sort of epilepsy that caitlin does caused by a genetic mutation and also animal models of arthritis and cancer addiction and that allows us to very quickly uh try and find the best cannabinoids for various disease conditions but we also do a lot of work with humans we do a lot of clinical trials and we partner with various minister cannabis companies and universities around the world to run these clinical trials and as richard mentioned in his talk there's still a lot of uncertainty about the evidence base for medicinal cannabis and the best way to convince doctors to prescribe medicinal cannabis is to provide them good quality evidence from clinical trials and we've recently continued trials for example in youth anxiety and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and effects on driving as well in the netherlands we've got currently running trials and things like tourette's syndrome insomnia exercise and endurance we also have a number of trials launching soon richard mentioned the antipsychotic effects of certain cannabinoids we're involved in a big study down in melbourne that's launching soon around that also there seems to be effects on addiction say alcohol dependence and methamphetamine dependence we're running trials on on these conditions and also pain with spinal cord injury and sleep so there's an awful lot of exciting clinical research to be done and we're very happy and privileged to be involved in that research and if you're interested in getting involved in clinical trials at the landmarks initiative then please go to our website and you can actually put your name down or on the list or yeah as someone that would like to be recruited for these trials another thing that we do is politics and policy that's a picture of me and my colleague jonathan arnold about to appear in front of richard's senate inquiry and that was a very important landmark in patient access so we do a lot of work on that and a lot of our research is around the kind of subterranean world of people in australia who can't access official medicinal cannabis and are using illicit cannabis and i'll talk a little bit more about that later on this evening another thing we do is we hear a lot of patient stories my email inbox is often uh full of stories from patients who've kind of reached the end of the road in terms of what conventional prescription medications can offer them this is an example here my husband's 55 years old he's in constant pain he's crushed vertebrae extensive arthritis bulging discs sleep apnea he cries through the night because he's in so much pain he's on the highest doses of pain relief legally allowed and the only pain specialist has just left our country town the current pain release not working i'm seeking alternatives uh would he be a good candidate for your studies if there are any trials for pain relief coming up could you please consider him so these are the sort of heart-rending stories that we often hear and we're very very keen to try and alleviate this extreme suffering that so many people experience in australia and we're keen to see whether medicinal cannabis offers a root away from that suffering and this is typical of the medications that our chronic pain patient is on you can see a pre-gabbling you can see heavy-duty opioids you can see ibuprofen and aspirin as well so there's not much more that conventional medications can offer to this per patient so what do we do in this case how do you access medicinal cannabis in australia well as richard outlined there's a range of products that can be obtained but it's something of a convoluted process because these are mostly unregistered medicines and you have to use a special access scheme from the tga to get hold of them nonetheless there's still 60 000 approvals that have been granted since this scheme started in late 2016 involving around 25 000 patients and 1500 doctors we were very frustrated through 2016 17 and 18 because the numbers were so low but there's been quite a remarkable increase in numbers particularly over the last year and a half and i think the latest figures in september there was more than six 000 approvals and this what this tells patients is basically it is possible for you to get hold of medicinal cannabis and many other people are the sort of conditions that people are getting approvals for are quite varied but as you'll see from this graph the vast majority are actually for chronic pain and there's also cancer pain neuropathic pain migraine fibromyalgia in the top 10 and anxiety is the second most common condition for which people get an approval for medicinal cannabis products a revolution in some ways has occurred with cannabis clinics opening in a lot of capital cities and this kind of guarantees a patient that as long as you're prepared to outlay 300 or 400 dollars you can see a doctor who's specialized and knowledgeable about the medicinal cannabis area and the problem is of course if you go to your regular gp he or she may or may not be educated around medicinal cannabis and a lot of them are still very uncertain and reluctant to prescribe so going it bypasses that process i have no financial interest in any of the clinics but i think it's important for you to know that that is an option if you're interested in trying medicinal cannabis and you can certainly find out information about these clinics on the web there's a wide range of products available and from your doctor through the special access scheme and most of them contain thc or cbd or a mixture of these two cannabinoids and there's actually quite a bamboozling array of products there's more than 150 medicinal cannabis products that are currently available in the australian market and medicinal cannabis is not necessarily what you think if you're thinking of old style cannabis that you roll into a joint or whatever more than 50 50 of the products are oils so you take these orally uh rather than smoking them there's also a fair number of capsules 16 of the products are capsules there's also oral sprays as well that you spray into your mouth there is cannabis flower material available about 17 of the current products are what we call cannabis flower or cannabis floss but rather than rolling them into a joint in the old traditional style these are vaporized usually so you get a vaporizer that heats up the cannabis you inhale the vapor and that avoids pyrolysis that involves smoke which is really bad for your lungs so the important thing to know is if you go to a cbd only product there'll be no intoxication but if you go to higher doses of thc containing products then you get intoxication with higher doses and that's an issue that can be managed but if you've never been intoxicated with thc before then you may find it quite unusual and it's better to titrate upwards if you're starting a thc product start from a very low goals and build up gradually over time there's a lot of good resources for you to learn more about medicinal cannabis recently the national prescribing service uh opened an excellent website uh nps for orgone eu which explains medicinal cannabis and how to access it very well both for consumers and also for doctors as well so that's an excellent resource there the tga itself also has very good consumer information so there's no real reason for you to be left in the dark about this area if you know where to look i'll also give a paper that came out last week that comes from our group which is a kind of simple how-to guide for prescribing medicinal cannabis and has a lot of the key information in the four or five page simple to understand document and that's a free download from australian prescriber so does medicinal cannabis work and and what are the side effects what what can you expect well let's have a look at thc first as i've mentioned it's the main intoxicating compound in cannabis so if you take a high dose of thc you get quite stoned and we know that's through an action of what's called cd1 cannabinoid receptors part of the endocannabinoid system when thc hits that receptor then that causes intoxication but lower doses of thc are thought to have therapeutic properties at levels that may not actually intoxicate you so it's important to divorce the loados and high dose effects thc has actually been available for decades as a drug called granabinol and it's been prescribed in countries other than australia for for quite a long time and the sort of things it's useful for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting as richard mentioned a lot of cancer patients get very sick when they're given chemotherapy and throw up and feel nauseous and thc has a good effect on that anorexia during palliative care and also with hiv aids there's evidence for that chronic pain and also spasticity and multiple sclerosis and there's a whole lot of interesting emerging indications as well we're starting to get an indication that thc may have some value in dementia and also tourette's syndrome and also in insomnia as well and here's a study that we were involved in with some oncologists at the lifehouse center in sydney and it verified the value of thc cbd containing capsules for people that had chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting that wasn't being helped by standard treatment so refractory cinv and this proves the point i think that cannabinoids can move in when conventional medications fail and produce a useful therapeutic effect there's also some good evidence from other uh trials of ms spasticity in fact this spray called sativex which contains thc and cbd has been used for many years for spasticity in multiple sclerosis the painful muscular spasms that people with ms experience and this is the only cannabinoid product that's currently registered in australia uh sanivex we've got a trial underway in queensland for tourette's syndrome for people that have uncontrollable ticks and we're starting to get an interesting signal from this trial that one of the conditions is placebo control so we don't know which one but one of them seems to be causing quite a remarkable reduction in tanks so we'll know the final answer to that question at the end of the year that that involves thc as well there's also some remarkable data from israel this is a very large um study of almost three thousand i think cancer patients with advanced cancer looking at what happens when they take a cannabis product for six months uh this is cannabis plant material and you if you look at the pain intensity rating at the beginning of the study before treatment there's 253 patients that rate their pain intensity as 10 129 at 9 23 at 8. so these are people really severe pain and after six months on cannabis you can see that very few patients had pain ratings that high and there was also remarkable improvements in quality of life in the study the tga has summarized the evidence themselves around medicinal cannabis and its then treated chronic non-cancer pain and they were quite cautious in a way but they did conclude and i'm sorry for this very busy table but if you focus just on the punchline down the bottom of the slide they concluded that the overall evidence is not very good and there's not that many robust clinical trials we're always looking for very good quality clinical trial evidence and unfortunately with cannabis the quality has not been that good historically it's been quite difficult to do clinical trials with cannabinoids but despite that they still concluded that there was moderate evidence that cannabinoids were effective in providing as much as a 50 percent reduction in pain so that's that's the tga the side effects to look out for well always good as i said earlier to titrate your cb your thc doses upwards gradually to avoid these side effects the higher doses can cause dizziness confusion cognitive impairment and some anxiety and paranoia in vulnerable individuals and if you have a family history of mental health problems particularly schizophrenia you'd probably best avoid at least higher doses of thc whether there are side effects or beneficial effects you may know appetite stimulation of thc and unusually good humor i'm not sure if that's a side effect or not and some people that have used thc for a long long time get a mild withdrawal syndrome when they come off it but it's nothing like the withdrawal that you see with opioids or with benzodiazepines there is an issue with driving a thc can cause a modest short lasting driving impairment and a slightly increased risk of a crash at very high doses t of thc this is sort of equivalent to low doses of alcohol but not higher doses of alcohol and in regular cannabis users we actually see substantially less driving impairment and in some measures of driving thc actually appears to reduce risk drivers appear to compensate for the presence of thc drive more slowly and leave a larger distance between them and the car in front and overall the risk with cannabis appears less than prescription medications where driving is actually legal so benzodiazepines opioids said drugs anti-histamines all impaired driving but there's no roadside broad testing for these substances with cbd there doesn't appear to be any driving impairment and i think we need to tweak the legislation in australia to better reflect actual risk that cannabis poses of course if you're on a thc product then you have no exemption from roadside drug testing so it's good to be aware that if you're taking a thc medication recently and you're probably vulnerable to giving a positive roadside drug test for at least six hours afterwards and we've done quite a lot of work on that and shown that the current roadside drug testing technologies are actually quite unreliable so some unlucky people may still give a positive test 24 hours later even when there's very little thc in their saliva while other people even 10 minutes after they've taken thc will give a negative test so the roadside testing technology is really not very good at all but you do run a risk under current legislation of being criminalized for driving under the influence of thc and we know this is a substantial disincentive for people joining our clinical trials where there's thc medications involved okay let me just tell you a little bit now about cbd it's the non-intoxicating cannabinoid it has a whole bunch of neurochemical actions that are very interesting but it doesn't hit the cb1 cannabinoid receptor like thcs so it doesn't get you intoxicated the way that thc does it seems to increase concentrations of endocannabinoids in the brain and the body and it has strong anti-inflammatory effects in a lot of the cellular models and animal models that we look at and recently the tga approved a cbd product called epidialex for pediatric epilepsy and this is very similar to what caitlin lambert was given illegally back in 2015 by her father she was obviously way ahead of her time and that that medication is now an approved medication five years later has taken all this time for the regulators to catch up and there's a whole load of very interesting and merging indications for cbd and uh as a new york times uh magazine said recently can cbd really do all that there's a huge amount of height that cbd is like a universal panacea and can relieve everything from depression to arthritis to diabetes to cancer to brain injury and we certainly need more signs to work through these um these claims and as with thc and cannabis in general there's generally a lack of high quality research and say with musculoskeletal diseases a recent review said that basically there's not anything other than anecdotal accounts and retrospective reviews so we desperately need to do high quality clinical trials of cbd in the pain arena this is it's already the case that many australian patients are using cbd for pain so if we go back to this slide the s4 category of medications in australia the medicinal cannabis products are cbd products so you can see from this graph but a lot of chronic pain patients and cancer pain and neuropathic pain patients are using cbd dominant products we just don't have any clinical trial evidence that they weren't but i assume that if people are using these products then they must do something useful one thing that we recently gathered evidence for with cbd was anxiety and we showed in a clinical trial in melbourne with the origin group the 12 weeks of treatment with cbd at quite high doses had quite a remarkable effect on young people with anxiety disorders and again these were sort of the the really hard cases these were young people who hadn't benefited from seeing a psychologist or from anti-depressant medication and we treated them in this clinical trial with um escalating doses of cbd and capsules over 12 weeks from 200 milligrams up to 800 milligrams i've really got quite a remarkable effect a highly significant reduction in their anxiety and impairment at week 12 or on two different measures of anxiety and also reduction in depressive symptomatology depression and anxiety often go hand in hand and their overall occupational functioning and social functioning their ability to get out the house and to make their way in in the outside world was greatly improved so there's a lot of a lot of promise there with higher doses of cbd in intractable anxiety and we need more and larger clinical trials to cement this effect in many countries around the world you can just walk into a health food store or a pharmacy and get cbd over the counter this is a shot i think in chicago the two of us cbd topical uh which is claiming to have some anti-pain effects you can even get cbd in your ice cream it's all become a little bit crazy in some ways in the usa the range of cbd products that are available and there's a lot of hype about lodo's cbd and sports we've got bubba watson there the top golfers swearing by the use of cbd it helps with his body and helps with his anxiety and i think most of the rugby players in the uk at the moment are on cbd to help them with recovery from matches and and cbd is widely available over the counter in the uk in fact this is me in my hometown of edinburgh walking into uh honda barrett in princess street to get hold of some five percent cbd i use it for tennis actually it seems to improve my very lousy game the thing about the over the cancer products is that they're very low doses so typically 10 to 100 milligrams of cbd whereas when we get to treating epilepsy or severe anxiety we're dealing with losses of 300 to 1500 milligrams so there's a real question mark around the evidence base for these logos cbd products interestingly in australia the tga has come out with an interim decision which may allow these logos cbd products to become over-the-counter medications in australia during 2021 but they're only allowing a recommended daily dose of up to 60 milligrams so while this is a really welcome development in terms of improving patient access to cbd there's a lot of uncertainty over whether these very low doses do anything in particular and uh some evidence has come recently from new zealand and in a study of uh patients who are prescribed cbd uh there was an encouraging signal with things like pain and discomfort and people who had lung cancer pain but also anxiety and depression so we certainly need better evidence that the evidence is starting to accumulate that needs to be consolidated and one of the key trials that we'll run at the lambert initiative next year is to look at low-dose cbd in adults older adults who have multi-moderate insomnia and we'll give half of them placebo and half of them are a low dose of cbd over 12 weeks escalating from 20 up to 60 milligrams and we'll hope to have a positive effect on their insomnia but also on anxiety pain moods cognitive function and quality of life so this is really a flagship study for us and moving forward another really important study i mentioned earlier people who suffer spinal injuries have to deal with the devastation of what that causes but to add further cruelty and about half of them experience chronic neuropathic pain as a result of their injury and we have a theory about what's going on in the brain with these patients and we have a theory that cbd may be able to turn down the pain signal and we're going to run a clinical trial and combine that with brain imaging and this is luke henderson sasha and sherry and elizabeth cairns from the lambert initiative they're going to run this trial and this could be a real major breakthrough in terms of cbd's use and intractable chronic pain some final thoughts just to close out my lecture and we have maybe 30 000 patients getting official cannabis by the end of this year that's great but the australian government's own figures from the australian institute of health and welfare suggest that 600 000 australians are currently using medicinal cannabis so 570 000 are probably using illegal products and richard referred to this gap between the legal scheme and what's actually happening on the ground and we published a paper recently where we surveyed 40 nearly 1400 australians that were using medicinal cannabis and found that only one in 30 of them were actually accessing their cannabis legally so that's a huge number of people that are continuing with illicit cannabis to treat their medical conditions and who suffer the risk of being criminalized if they fall into the criminal justice system and when we look to the conditions that these people were self-medicating with what's it cannabis for pain was 37.5 of the total of uh main conditions cited for use of cannabis and back pain was particularly prevalent prevalence as well as arthritis nerve pain and fibromyalgia and also a lot of mental health conditions that were being self-medicated as well so we still have a long way to go in terms of bridging that gap between the official scheme and illicit use one reason for encouragement is australia has a lot of clinical trials around medicinal cannabis when we last counted there was more than 60 and we're probably one of the best countries in the world for doing clinical trials for medicinal cannabis we have a great health system and we have access to um i guess reasonably reasonably good quality products for these trials another final point which i think is a very important one is that we've seen worldwide the huge problems with prescription opioids and richard referred to this in his talk and particularly the mortality with you know 60 or 70 000 deaths in the u.s last year mostly from fentanyl and oxycodone and heroin overdoses and an interesting thing that seems to happen when medicinal cannabis becomes legal in various u.s states there's 25 percent reduction in opioids overdose mortality according to the studies so when cannabis becomes available people use less prescription opioids and other studies suggest people use less lyrica and gabapentinoid type drugs and also benzodiazepines so that in itself is probably a good reason to improve access because medicinal cannabis i think is a lot less harmful certainly than the opioids and the benzodiazepines we at the lambert initiative will continue to try and build a better cannabis and in our research where we've got some of these plant components that aren't thc or cbd that look very exciting we have one called cbc that has very strong anti-anxiety effects cbg seems to be showing quite remarkable effects against inflammation cbga is an anti-convulsant and we're also working on a range of new molecules that seem to just give the endocannabinoid system a big boost and by doing that they've reduced pain anxiety and depression so it's a very very exciting time to be involved in this field and thank you so much for the opportunity to give this lecture well well thank thank you ian for uh such a comprehensive presentation that really sort of walked us through so many aspects to do with medicinal cannabis so um so that was really fantastic it certainly increased my understanding quite a lot and i i'm sure it did with many members of the audience um richard maybe a question for you to start with someone has asked whether it's possible to confirm if medicinal cannabis is an item that could be purchased with home care package funds or is that something uh that is probably quite particular right it's it's quite a specific question i guess yeah i i i doubt it i think unfortunately the access pathways as we've described and it's very hard to see how um the government would permit the use of those funds to access um medication like this so i think that's unlikely doesn't mean it's the right decision i think ultimately what we really are aiming for is to have a product that you know all products the many many different products but to have a range of products that are affordable and one of the other recommendations in the uh senate inquiry was that if we can't if we don't achieve that through just um having uh more products come online and cost come down then ultimately uh we need to set up some sort of subsidy scheme and um and that would be you know that's that's something that the committee recommended but i suspect particularly at the moment the government's not particularly keen to to come out thanks richard um and ian a question for you the use of medicinal cannabis as a sort of a complementary medicine to other forms someone mentions about taking medicinal cannabis alongside chemotherapy what are your comments in relation to that in a sort of a complementary sense well i think the evidence is fairly good now that um you can get relief from some of the adverse symptoms of chemotherapy with um particularly thc but cbd may also have a wall as well and we've certainly shown up with nausea and vomiting but a lot of people actually develop neuropathic pain neuropathy as a result of chemotherapy particularly drugs like that and um depending on animal models it seems the prevention of that kind of neuropathy with cannabinoids as well so it's certainly worth considering and and i think that recent study from people grimacing was just published last month may reverberate around the world actually in terms of clinical practice and that is the hope that you know we're doing these clinical trials to try and change the way that doctors behave and to give patients a better chance of a therapeutic response particularly in you know areas like cancer where there can be quite extreme suffering the in sorry richard a question for you um just someone's commenting it's strange that medicinal cannabis is controlled by the poison standard in australia well um the i think ian touched on it the there's a very long history around the use of cannabis uh in any setting and um that has been responsible for really holding back a lot of the um developments that we've we're now starting to see is the drugs officially illegal and uh that made that made it very difficult and that's by not by um dint of uh just australian law that's an international convention on the use of drugs uh effectively prohibited the use of cannabis now um that's changed recently but it's it is one of the reasons why we you know we're only starting now to see you know the the field flourish and the i think potential of the very many different preparations starting to be explored now ian could probably talk about the many obstacles i suspect they've had to confront over their uh years in this field sorry i used to joke that uh be easier to you know land a chimp on the moon than to run a clinical trial with with this whole cannabis and that's that's what it was like uh certainly in the early days that there was no familiarity around clinical trial ethics and governance for these products that's one of the reasons that our flagship driving study we did in the netherlands because we could actually give people cannabis products and allow them to drive on on real roads and so i think it'd be fair to say that as of 2019 2020 there's a lot better understanding around clinical trial governance and in fact talking to overseas companies they sort of hold australia up as a great destination to do their clinical trials so so that that's been a bit of a change and i think one of the key things is actually to differentiate cbd and thc is as soon as governance and ethics and doctors understand that difference and you're running a cbd trial everything becomes much much easier um there's still issues with thc and particularly recruiting patients when we tell them that they're on a thc product and they can't drive for 12 weeks for the duration of the trial that's terribly difficult and we probably lose about 50 of our potential recruits for trials as a result of that single item and and then um a question regarding the efficacy of edible versus vaporized medicinal cannabis it's a very good question i have some colleagues who work in pain meds and who say that vaporized is good for breakthrough pain because it's fairly instantaneous so you know you'll feel the effects within two or three minutes so um whereas oral you have a very different what we call pharmacokinetics so how quickly the drug comes on and how quickly it disappears so with oral products you probably are waiting a couple of hours before you get the peak you may feel them within half an hour or so so you get a kind of longer more sustained therapeutic effect with your products but if you have something that he's dealt with very rapidly for example breakthrough pain then vaporized might be best and richard um a question regarding does does each doctor have to apply to the tga to access medical cannabis for prescription or does the tga issue one permit for all prescribers no so um i should have said this in my talk you can become an authorized prescriber that is also another pathway however that is notoriously difficult and there are very few authorized prescribers in australia and they're for a very narrow set of conditions i think largely for pediatric epilepsy maybe almost exclusively neurologists so you can't become an authorized prescriber easily it's as i said almost impossible and uh to my knowledge there aren't there may be one or two gps but certainly not more than that in the country um the other pathway requires you to apply individually for each patient and what's worse is at least at the time of the senate inquiry is that your approval was valid only for a specific preparation and so if you wanted to try something else or now the cheese you have said they were looking at it at the time but look it was very difficult you had to basically justify you you would get approval for that patient for that preparation uh and um unfortunately anybody else you you had you have to go through the same the same process it's it's fair to say that the process has become more streamlined it was very difficult in the early days but even so if you're a gp and you're sitting there and you might have you know if you're lucky your gp spends a bit of time with you but the difference between seeing a few extra patients each day is either write the script for the drug that you can get very quickly or spend a few minutes um and it can be five minutes ten minutes uh going through this process and and in some ways having your i suppose clinical judgment questioned by the tga um gps just don't like doing that that's a that's a barrier and so i think that i touched on this earlier i think that one pathway through this is similar to what we've done with other drugs is that trying to build uh an authorized prescriber pathway for gps who can demonstrate they've done some basic training they're up to date with the literature they basically are now um have have some knowledge and expertise in the field and they're now authorized prescribers and they can basically prescribe this in the same way prescribe other medicines that's the way to fix it i think thanks for that richard um ian a question um is there any concern in prescribing uh medicinal cannabis for people with cognitive decline could could it um confuse uh increase confusion in any way it's a very interesting question and very valid question as well with um cbd we know that it has quite strong neuroprotective effects so certainly in animal models it seems to reverse some of the neural degeneration that you get there's some very good australian research actually with um animal models of alzheimer's disease where cbd's had quite remarkable effect in restoring cognitive function we're yet to see that in human clinical trials yet but it's an interesting signal um another thing that is interesting with thc is again in animal models i mean we know that thc tends to impair cognition particularly in young people but uh in animal models of dementia it seems to restore cognition which is quite incredible uh there's also a signal coming from western australia a small study that was done for when you give thc to patients with agitation and dementia and we've all seen with the royal commission into nursing homes the the the the chemical restraint and and the the royal commission into disability as well the issue of restraint with antipsychotic drugs and benzodiazepines a major one and what we're starting to see in very small studies is if you give thc and cbd together in agitated patients then there may actually be a a beneficial effect in terms of reducing agitation that's one of the trials that we hope to run a large trial on in the next couple of years because it's such a major issue for for nursing homes and people in the in in elderly care richard um someone's asked about uh how would you find out find a rheumatologist that might consider the prescription of medicinal cannabis should it be appropriate is it is it a matter of uh just raising it with your rheumatologist and um and uh you know finding a rheumatologist i guess there's no particular list around a specialist would there be no it's a good question and unfortunately we you know a lot of this is word of mouth i think ian mentioned this these new cannabis clinics but it's you know it's a few hundred bucks three or four hundred bucks just for a console um and so most people just don't you know why should they have to pay that i mean to access what could be a you know very effective therapy so um beyond that it really is word of mouth and i as far as i'm aware i don't know that there's any publicly accessible information on uh doctors who have expertise in this field uh as is always the case whenever you've got something like this there are always people also um who seek to make a quick buck out of it as well and so you've got to be careful uh that who you're talking to is reputable um i think most you know most gps would absolutely who are keen to prescribe it will will have done their homework but unfortunately unless ian's got any other suggestions uh it's largely word of mouth um and asking your gp if they if they don't can they recommend somebody who does ask this as your rheumatologist if they don't uh ask somebody who does uh and if they're not health um find someone who is i think i think that is probably would that be your opinion ian that it is pretty much word of mouth it is i mean there's you can go to the access clinics and they probably know which specialists are savvy in this area but as richard said you're probably up for 300 or 400 dollars to get that information um i i know a very good rheumatologist but i will mention his name in this forum but we're doing some research with him at the moment and getting some extraordinary effects in models of arthritis that we want to take into uh so they do exist and you may have to shop around and maybe if you have a conversation with your rheumatologist they might be able to refer you onto someone i mean i i think it's changed a lot in the last three or four years with doctors i think they're much more savvy about this area and we still particularly in some specializations have a lot of skepticism you know we did a survey recently of gastroenterologists and only 20 of them wanted to prescribe as as of 2020 so that was a little bit disappointing but in psychiatry and neurology and maybe maybe in pain medicine to a certain extent as well we're getting more positive responses from from pain medicine specialists and addiction medicine as well we're starting to see this tide of change and i think maybe doctors and specialists fear they may be left behind if they don't at least learn about this they don't necessarily have to embrace it wholeheartedly but the more patients ask them about it the more they'll be forced to upskill in this area which is tremendously important for them to do that that's that's very true um in just a very important point and richard just sort of raised this in his last comments uh the difference between medicinal cannabis and the cannabis that the the local dealer might grow in their backyard i think that importance of actually getting good quality product um you know what what should the sort of the average community member who's interested in medicinal cannabis or finding out about it what what they should what should they be wary of in relation to this particular issue i'll go to you first in well one of the most fun studies i've ever been involved in we had the new south wales police bring us i think more than 250 bags of weed that they confiscated from i think mostly the byron bay music festival but a variety of other locations um and we analyzed the street cannabis it actually came from all around new south wales and what we found was that there was only five or six samples that actually had any cbd in them so the problem i think is that street cannabis and i'd love to repeat that study just to prove that nothing's changed but overwhelmingly i think street cannabis tends to be thc dominant so you're unlikely to get cbd and unless you can find a source and these sources do exist with people who have more of a medical um flavor to to their illegal supply and there are people that do that and but yeah the the problem with getting an illicit supply is probably that you're going to get very high thc cannabis with no cbd so you'll miss the benefits that cbd can offer but there's also issues with you know was a pesticide or a fungicide used in the growth of that cannabis um if it's an oil where solvent you know sometimes butane is used lighter fuel is used to extract cannabinoids now i don't want to scare monitor but but you know if you don't know the provenance of your cannabis product then you do run that risk and that's why we need a much better official scheme uh in australia so that people can benefit from quality assurance or around official products um richard did you have a last comment in relation to that issue what would you advise you know patients that you may have seen yes um i think alien's right just on the seat on the thc cbd issue just it's important to sort of spell out that the cbd and the reason that's in like quantities in street cannabis is that modulates against the effects of the thc so the thc makes you high the cbd in some ways prevents some of the action that action and therefore most of the stuff you get on the street is very low in cbd so that people can experience the euphoria and there's nc lose some of those benefits the other thing that's interesting is as ian said there are people who specifically supply medicinal cannabis products illicitly but even where that market's been tested there's huge variation in terms of what people are getting in terms of the quantities of cbd and indeed in some there were some operations that had almost none undetectable levels so if you're getting your medicinal cannabis product illicitly you may be getting a decent product but you may be getting something that as ian said is potentially dangerous but huge variation in terms of what's available so really the only way to be sure is to get something uh through a regulated market and that's where my interest here is to try and put some quality control have a regulated market gives doctors confidence no you know in terms of knowing obviously what they're prescribing and people confidence in knowing uh what they're getting so it comes back to that question of trying to find a gp who can prescribe you a product uh which has gone through a rigorous quality control process otherwise you just don't know what you're getting that's right that's right look that's uh we've reached the sort of the end of our um we've hit our finishing time now and i'm very aware of not keeping our presenters uh much longer and there have been some unanswered questions but we certainly uh i think ian and richard were very generous in trying to get through as many questions as they could listen i would like to thank you both because i think tonight's been fantastic to just give a improve people's understanding around medicinal cannabis some of the issues uh in the research area also at the sort of political and legislative area so it's been really fantastic to just have this discussion and put it out there for the community and hopefully increases increase under people people's understanding and knowledge around the current situation in australia so ian richard i'd like to on behalf of musculoskeletal australia thank you both very much for your generous uh time and skills and expertise that you've shared with us tonight i'd like to thank everyone for joining us as well uh there were some fantastic sites within uh ian's presentation with regards to where you can see further information we have information on our musculoskeletal australia website as well about medicinal cannabis and also you could always ring our helpline on 1-800-263-265 if there are some other questions that you have or your question wasn't answered tonight so look on that note i wish everyone a very good evening thanks so much for joining us and thanks again to ian and richard and good night everyone

Aj668XjTGgQ,Medical cannabis eligibility in Australia explained by Clare Barker,2020-10-05T02:00:17Z,so what would make you eligible to have medicinal cannabis prescribed for you first thing to know is currently in australia a medicinal cannabis is an unapproved medicine so it can't be a frontline treatment but to be eligible there is a misconception that you have to have tried absolutely everything that is out there and that cannabis is your last resort it's actually not just a last resort the truth is you must have tried multiple treatments and you and your doctor can actually work through them to say you've tried enough of those and they can actually therefore build a case for why you need to actually move on to medicinal cannabis you need to be able to state why your traditional medications haven't worked or why those medications just were not tolerable to you there certainly have been cases where people have been concerned about the pharmaceutical type medicines and they've actually so therefore they've tried herbals and meditations etc and they've had their applications approved as long as the doctor has been able to prove that you've tested significant other treatments and that they haven't worked you
fcXnSJygjv8,Medical cannabis application process Australia - Jessi CDA,2020-01-25T00:38:31Z,you'll get a call from one of our patient care team members and they'll just do an eligibility screening so it's really quick 30-second eligibility screening and though they'll ask you what condition you have the symptoms that you have and how long you've had them and whether or not you have that history of your condition or your symptoms with your regular doctor and that's because we require a referral from your regular doctor or specialist they're not they don't have to agree to cannabis they don't have to know about it they're really just validating your symptoms once we have that referral and a short and relevant health summary then we can book you in to see one of our doctors once you're booked in to see one of our doctors they'll go through the consultation with you and they'll ask you a bunch of questions about your condition and then the doctor will send an application to the TGA so the TGA is within the Department of Health they require the doctor to do an application to them once that application has been approved and emailed to the doctor the doctor can then prescribe the product as they would any other medication so they they write the script and they send that to the patient or direct to the pharmacy and then the pharmacy fills that order the pharmacy has to order the product from the wholesaler they don't keep the product in stock at the pharmacy and they order the product and and then they give the patient a call say your orders really do you like to pay for that over the phone would you like us to courier it out or will you come in and collect the prescription
OyfsinQZB7g,Australian Medicinal Cannabis Research,2020-07-22T13:14:46Z,"hi everyone I hope you can all hear me welcome to the webinar for tonight the Australian medicinal cannabis research as our topic and it's hosted by myself I'm doing on one of the pharmacies here that works at Health House and we've had a massive amount of interest in this subject with lots of exciting things happening at the moment just remember that tonight the guidance that you might hear or the medical advice we always prefer that you speak to your medical professional first before you follow any of that guidance so it's not intended as a substitute for your current medication management plan so there are six researchers tonight that we will be speaking to this evening and it's a panel style questionnaire at the end if you have any questions at the bottom of your screen you'll see a couple of options don't choose the chat function because we don't want to just have a good old chat tonight we want to answer some really interesting questions so you can use that question-and-answer function at the bottom of your screen and we'll try and get through as many as we can for about half an hour near the end one thing we have to consider as well as around the world the US normally lead leads the way with pharmaceutical research but in this case medicinal cannabis is currently federally illegal in the US and research for them is really difficult there's about ten separate permits that they require and the lack of GMP produced concentrates and looking at the release research a little bit globally as well the other limitation is much of the trials conducted have used smoked cannabis so it makes it variable in quality and difficult to create a placebo option as well for patients if we look at our homeland Australia has a lot of advantages and and not the least of which is government support our federal Health Minister Greg hunt is really supportive of research and there's lots of government grants and funding especially in New South Wales and Victoria where the state governments have been proactive in this space and lastly Australia has made sure that any cannabis used on our domestic market is of GMP quality and this is overseen by the TGA or the Therapeutic Goods Administration so it's important to do the research properly without bias and test against placebo and/or other medications if it's possible which is one area that the team here at health house really does support so enough of me let's start off with our first speaker this is Professor macro Falasca who will join us near the end he's from Curtin University here in WI and he's been engaged in development and the progression of pancreatic diseases particularly discovering possibly new mechanisms and options for them one of the most lethal types of cancer being pancreatic cancer you can see some of the impact this has with a couple of statistics that I've listed here happening in Australia Marconi's team specialized in selma tab ilysm and from 2018 have discovered potentially new medicinal cannabis treatment he is currently testing a range of cannabinoid base formulations in vitro and against human pancreatic cancer cell lines grown in the lab so this is either standalone medicinal cannabis treatment or in combination with existing chemotherapy agents his plans then include implementing these findings in human trials so let's hear some of the things he has to say about his research first up Marko welcome thank you for that for joining us today and being part of this how long have you been studying cannabis and what first got you into this industry I thank you for giving me this opportunity so the other long-standing interest in lipid metabolism biology and particular class of liability very similar to endocannabinoids so in that sense I've been interested in this lipids with the endocannabinoids structure and properties but I think the since the discovery of the receptor of this lipid in 2007 and this receptor belongs this putative cannot be a receptor so this in Judaism introduced being fully in this field so and therefore start investigating cannabidiol first and then Canobie so that says more than 10 years now and really saw the body working pancreatic cancer are you considering human trials now of course our aim and objective and ultimate desire is to bring what we found in the lab setting and animal testing in trials there are quite a few years we considering this option but there are few obstacles that we need to overcome so it's I hope we can get to trials quite soon because we need definite demonstration that the cannabis component cannot be no it's can have a value and at least improve chemotherapy in so in your opinion could a different ratio of THC and CBD all the minor cannabinoids potentially extended the life of models but do you think they secure their curious big words so specially in pancreatic cancer we need to be very careful it's a very aggressive disease and we've seen good response but I would be you know a bit careful in talking about cure so of course this is a long aim but definitely adding the the there is great potential our data demonstrating at least in some patients so and this a bit the complication we are because we start investigating cannabidiol and then the question was is cannabidiol or is cannabis or other components synergizing we cannabidiol and and this is of course part of the research that is ongoing so we have ready some results we we can publish this soon so we can have a definite answer to this question in recent pancreatic cancer but i think there is a value this is what we investigating different cannabinoids combinations and beyond pancreatic cancer because we know interested in other fields like obesity diabetes so inflammatory bowel disease so there are many other conditions where this is well known but we are interested in investigating these sort of fields as well thanks thank you so much for your work and being part of this webinar really thank you alrighty so our next speaker for tonight is dr. Amanda Tim lot and she works at the University of Notre Dame here in w.a and she's researching the potential benefits of medicinal cannabis in dementia patients so the trial she's part of users our randomized double-blind crossover placebo control and it's designed to evaluate the behavioral changes quality of life and the level of discomfort caused by painting in about 50 participants this trial uses an oral spray and it administers a combination of THC and CBD under the tongue and in addition to the patient's current medication management plan let's hear what Amanda had to say about the trial findings so far so go through a couple of questions with you first one is in what dementia symptoms are you looking for improvement of your child you know so we're looking for a lot of the behavioral symptoms associated with dementia so it's things like anxiety maybe some things like aggression so whether it's physical aggression on physical aggression you know verbal aggression that's the thing maybe also improvements in sleep as well as agitation and so the anxiety and depression we're also looking at quality of life and pain as well as two other factors yeah that's quite important as well particularly for dementia patients what are some of the challenges that you've faced since starting particularly with this lovely pandemic or hitting us at the beginning of the year this project has not come without its challenges um but has not made it any easier of that regards um right from the very beginning there's been issues with legislation so the guardianship and administration Act of 1990 has been silent on medical research so it's really impacted on you who we can actually include in the study so try to get the right participants initially it limited who we could include so we can only include those with mild dementia which is a bit of a shame because we think those with more moderate to severe symptoms would benefit most from the medication so it's caused us to go back and rework the project a little bit short the duration as well as make sure we look at the inclusion exclusion criteria and make sure were actually trying to get those who could benefit the most from the medication we've also had issues with trying to get into aged care facilities so for the term term high-turnover with staff has been quite stressful my my perspective but they don't tend to stay in the rolls very long so once I go in engage with an agent care facility by the time we're ready to administer or look at potential since they've kind of moved on to another role yeah and what's like yeah particularly in the information then to the next staff member I guess yeah it's constantly engaging yeah those sort of handover there's no sort of thing so I kind of failure them out of the police yeah and then what sort of effects did you find patients have all the carries family members reporting so far in the trial you know we're seeing that they their family members seem to be a lot calmer especially doing covered it's made them their family members will relax so it's kind of taking the pressure off them because they haven't been able to go and visit their family members in the facilities I feel like it's a bit of being on the medication and it's kind of helped yeah there's also been sort of improvements with the lack of calling out you know more relaxation oh it's just that that's affordable or less less agitated so there's a lot of little sort of positive stuff that were started starting to see you wanted to add I guess I asked you certain ones that I would have liked you know about the tribe but if you feel like you want to add in something go go for it I guess the only thing is that than the one positive that's come under covert is that we change to the guardianship and administration actually better research so now we're going through and changing our approvals again to make sure we can include those with moderate and severe dementia so yeah we're now at the stage we want it to be acting that's awesome would that plan well the number that you're including part of the trial then we're still keeping with our initial number of you know yeah but it's completely easier yeah and provide the facility and only be able to recruit to even now good site people going facility attend okay yeah awesome thanks very much all righty so a next speaker for tonight actually began some of her work in 2018 she was part of the world first study at UWA and initially the trial wanted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of using oral medicinal cannabis extract compared to a placebo for the treatment of insomnia so dr. Jennifer Walsh was part of a trial that administered sublingually at night an hour before bed in addition to the patient's current medication plan and she will explain now what else had entailed and what the team discovered at the time according to the results we see that there was a decrease in the omnia severity index by Aboriginal 26% across all participants and 36% we buried cheated with higher driving could you please tell us a bit more about the results and if you were surprised with the outcome yeah well actually we were surprised that the relevant results were as positive the participants reductions in their insomnia symptoms when they were taking the active medication versus Deebo they reported sleeping longer they were awake for less time during the night and they felt more refreshed when they woke up this data aligned with our objective data as well of their sleep quality so we used active Rafi to sleep quality and quantity and so that's actually based on a wrist worn device that measures activity and inactivity being a surrogate for swing and we majorly so every three weeks and the activity I had showed that they slept for longer and they work out lives during the night as well and I must admit that one of the other things that I was quite surprised it's that just by going to great lengths to ensure that the placebo was very well matched to the active medication in terms of cell appearance Buddha for example every single one of the participants actually identified when they were taking the active medication so and it wasn't because they could see a difference of smell the difference or taste the difference it was because of the foundation that they slept Asia and so I imagine it's very difficult to be blind for that Wow interesting - very what went among the inclusion and exclusion criteria leads to your study so we took men and women who are aged between 25 and 70 years and they had to have chronic insomnia and we defined this as self-reported difficulty here is she 18 sleep getting so that is getting to see or staying asleep so that is not waking up during the night time for at least 30 minutes so took at least 30 minutes to get to sleep although away from all the 30 minutes overnight and they had this issued for at least 3 nights of the week for at least three months and they also had to have an insomnia 30 units grown with him we excluded anyone who is currently taking any psychotropic medication so anything basically the influence their it way more sleep if they were taking and so no people equally inhibited medications you had a nine sensitivity to cannabinoids or had been using cannabis in the past couple of months anyone with any significant that um psychopathological conditions any people with current suicidal ideation if they had another sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea a movement disorder anyone who was consuming more than two standard drinks on average per week per night per week I come across the week anyone whose kids do too much caffeine evenings people who were shift workers or athletes or who worked jobs that require them to have cannabis drug screen or anyone who is required to drive in ten hours of taking the medication because we ask people not to drive during the day we went throughout the trial there actually changed and we were required to ask people not to drive for five days taking a single dose we're gonna actually do more about some cannabis and driving through this webinar which is great all right so our next speaker for tonight dr. janet schloss wolf was the lead researcher looking at the effects of medicinal cannabis on glioblastoma multiforme which is an aggressive type of brain cancer with a very low survival rate as you can see listed on the slide the research is important because of the potential for medicinal cannabis managing either quality of life for patients or the progression of the disease in this case it was a randomized double-blind trial that ended up assessing two different ratios of medicinal cannabis a one to one or one to four ratio THC to CBD in addition to the patients management plan so let's see if some of the questions that we thought to ask her about this hi everyone here we have Janice lush as well for the research on glioblastoma and I'll start off with asking before starting your research what made you decide that you wanted to see the effect of can is cannabis on we are blastoma as a title and CERN particular yeah it was really interesting to learn I was joining research on medicinal cannabis and because I have a big interest in cancer was looking at what our research had been conducted on different types of cancer and then we found that most of it at feeding Dominic Astana and that they had been in front of the first studies that looked at for treatment of the Dickens but such a bad fantastic outcome and then I was talking at dinner conference and to the doctors then Charlie tier it was actually there as well he was presenting after me started after a trauma doctor even had a chat with me this is what I'm actually thinking of I think that you know it would be west Boyle and he's in the area store that's awesome and that would have been a a big name to walk up to as well at the time I'm sure I know I've only seen you on TV I should say it seemed so down to earth when you start actually so what was the sort of summary of results that you have observed so far for the trial well yeah so we've now completed it and we can test for measure which is good but we end up with a needs three people were actually alone and because this was a tolerability study what we found is that everybody liked already really well the two different ratios of THC distributing and we did a wonder one and for the wonderful times yep see we have no major issues that all we have noticed serious adverse events and the main side effects that we actually got for his illness drowsiness tiredness dry skin dry mouth that was the main ones we do have our slow titration oh yeah for it and then when we actually look at the functionality of it we found that there was actually statistically significant for both physical and functional I mean the patient's themselves but highly successful in everything also it was fantastic yeah I know everybody's also interested in the outcome of achievements Emily we did actually do MRIs at the beginning whom they're based on and at 12 weeks and remember this is only like a snapshot so we are still gathering the survival data and all that type of thing but when we found over at that three months remember these people who had a recurrence of glioma it's that 45% actually had stable disease really juiced first we had 16% of just had slight enhancements and then 10% reality that's actually a really good outcome yeah that's awesome too well to them particularly to be able to compare as well then the scans and really good results from from my perspective it would be something that you would have liked to have changed in the research that was conducted know what actually wouldn't want to change really yeah I like the fact that we did a pragmatic trial that was across the board and yes it wasn't a very like if you look at the medical eternity if they very much like you know it can be this has to be this particular mutation cigarette into these type of patients well the hard part is is with medicinal cannabis that we don't know who was actually going to work I mean for this so it's one of the reasons why we chose a pragmatic they said that when we can go on to do the next study who can be a lot more specific so I mean the only thing I would have changed is that I didn't realize it was going to be so sought after and that I would have put more people on the phones and getting them sorted when we had influx of interest at paquimé of the job makes sense and then now that you've finished up with this what's sort of next in line for your research yes are we already in discussions who the Daleks pays for it we still waiting on the analysis of the cannabinoid to the endocannabinoids from the blood samples and I'm hoping that will actually help us to guide us to was going to be a much more specific inclusion criteria right but yeah so we're we're looking at at the moment after doing Australian wide study it was 100 metres problems but it was only a single site sunny was that people had to fly it and that they were obviously corresponds with them because it had brain tumors they have to increase dexamethasone consumption over their teaching time worth applying and afterwards so to be able to reduce that and have like a child centered in each of the main capital cities and maybe some regional ones as well will be a huge benefit to the actual patients and they're going to be a lot more specific attitude when we actually start treatment it's actually useful because we had a whole range of people who were actually on cameras all in mind that many people aren't at all in mind we had six people who are the Mustang and the bus them at the same time willing to on a bus so we found that there was no interaction with any of them were to inspect testing but at this day to know would be really good we can actually target one particular type of drug in that people who are actually in that cohort and that's what we're working on yeah that's really interesting as well particularly for pharmacists out there with clinical drug interactions and knowing that would be really good for I'm sure that patient clientele but many others so thank you so much for today no worries it's been a pleasure thank you alrighty sorry Janet for saying the wrong ratio I realized it was one to one and then a four to one so apologies for that all right so our next for tonight is Thomas Arkell and he is from the lambo initiative at the University of Sydney and he was the lead PhD candidate that conducted a randomized double-blind crossover design with 14 volunteers and this trial looked at comparing the effects of THC dominant cannabis that was vaporized and that compared to cannabis containing an equivalent amount so a balanced formula of THC and CBD and a third group of placebo on simulated driving and cognitive performance the results are now actually published in the journal psychopharmacology so let's hear some of the things that Thomas had to say as to what they discovered hi Tom thank you for joining us today could you tell us what equipment you used in your study to assess driving - yeah we're looking at recent simulated driving we we never simulated we had custom-built for us by a company down in Hathaway so this was basically I'm getting a whole lot of component from real cough to things like the theme steering wheel and stripping them out and then studying their hands fists metal frame and then we mount least three big TVs on around the dashboard and so you get this sort of visually immersive hundred ninety degree field of view a vigil thing and then projected onto that we have this software program what's running the simulation tasks and some disciplines completed against row of highway and rural driving there were sections that designed to be demanding and difficult other more but not mess straight or Drive I was standing on those different kinds of conditions but really here the simulator was I suppose was designed to mimic rural and driving as much as possible and length distance feel like they were actually in a car and we think back tension would get on a wheel as a viable and we also have a number community artists as well computer is classic divided attention reaction time of processing speeds of things that are quite important and essential skills and in day-to-day driving behavior through your study will vaporize an abyss that is Ellen's THC CBD concentration that's the THC dominant I'm could you tell us how cool formulations such as oils animal contain so the main difference here really just come down to the duration of effects until with it with an equivalent dose 15 units probably similar similar level of impairment with all products the main difference is home a lot at least burning to cut off and paint an arrow to the kick any and they may last about six to eight hours and some cases even longer so it's possible that I'm driving apparently stay with my pressed cannabis might just be extended I might last but quite a bit long we don't work for that okay that makes sense and how much the impairment to driving with cannabis be different to driving with other CNS depressants actions are my periods or I'm Ben's own in a way it's a bit difficult to make this comparison because it really all comes down to dose and tolerance but I suppose what quite filling is there was a really big European study the effect of alcohol and other drugs and driving that was published a little while ago now and that concluded that the effects of cannabis were really fairly low risk of agrees to middle of an expectancy drivers that have one alcohol concentration of up to about 105 legal limit with Mendoza and Oakland this effects will be stronger so they were more similar driver Katie 0.05 point oh eight so little bit hard to thing you know that one better or worse than another I think a real difference is the sedation and the drowsiness with those uh nope you don't really humble caliber but they make strapless and be minded not seen Canada nice reliance thank you very much alright and finally I want to introduce you to our last speaker of tonight Charlene Mabel and medical dentists and she's the managing director of medicinal cannabis research Australia that was established in 2016 she is ideal to summarize what's happening right here right now in our country so let's hear what she had to say and if you're still here and listening with us after this will be probably the most interesting part of tonight's session where we'll do a question-and-answer time everybody my name is Charlene Maine or I'm a medical scientist and also managing director of medical cannabis researchers from young okay in asked today to give you a brief overview of cancer research in Australia using the distal cannabis medical cannabis research Australia is a charity that we established back in 2016 when we realized we needed to educate medical professionals and patients about the use of medical cannabis and also the endocannabinoid system we also have a strong advocacy mission to try and help patients with access to legal additional campus for us and we also need are very interested in advocating for research promoting research and facilitating increased research into more conditions when a medical cannabis may be used so looking at the Australian research platform we've got 69 patient studies which are happy having either announced in the media or are in progress it's also include patient enrollment in global studies eleven of these have no child is the escaped on any global trail register including that of Australia of 58 mr. child's seven have no ethics approval to date ten are using synthetic cannabinoids but I want to talk about the other child's which are using coal plant extracting cannabis products there are twenty non-commercial research groups deducting these and twenty-nine commercial research groups so with these child's underway using plant extract products we see nine safety and tolerability trials eight cancer types of symptom trials of what one of these is you have already heard about which of the guide has trainer told by my german sauce is also for epilepsy and seizures syndrome trials looking at chronic pain we have five trials select disorders in insomnia five child's looking at medicinal cannabis and its effects on driving we have four trials of course this is very important research topic and we need this information as soon as we possibly can there is also one behavior disorder trial and further to that is eleven other indications trials underway and I'll quickly run through those Tourette's syndrome prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or motor neuron disease gingivitis inflammation muscle damage and functional recovery after exercise anxiety disorder child and dementia trial and alcohol withdrawal trial use cannabis reps syndrome and also there are a few observational studies underway or about to be under ramping at a multitude of conditions and products looking at international trial involvement with Australians GW Pharma has spearheaded most of these and this is through their research of GW research limited so we have a study to investigate in efficacy and safety of cannabidiol with javaee patients and we have to clean hotels sites in Australia in Victoria and New South Wales this trial was actually just completed so hopefully we'll be seeing some results and conclusions read not limited to very soon is also to open-label extensive Charles using cannabidiol for one physicians in doulas versus complex twelve children in New South Wales artists and even this one and this is not going so results to follow it's also a trial for it syndrome and we have patient in her exact breasts for the Queensland participating and that is due for completion September next year Australian trials and science we have already heard from the 11 initiative and even aggregor regarding their Tourette's syndrome RCT there's also two trials which will be observational and also looking at multiple conditions or multiple products the first one is being around the biochem Burleigh clinics and Swinburne University of Technology in this in 2000 patients looking at dosage patterns of efficacy and also an upcoming trial called the cannabinoid medicine observational study and that we'll be looking at in this segment to 20,000 patients so over another of years and that is awaiting ethics approval so that's run by applied cannabis research in cannabis access clinics and I know they are using new group fun products but possibly other products as well now I find this a bit of an exciting australia-wide trial which is being proposed can urban are as a treatment for young people with up to high risk for psychosis proposed as a RCT and this will involve 405 patients and that is being run by origin we welcome the Wellcome Trust okay grant that's enough from lead for today thank you very much for your participation and please do follow us on the social where we do continue to share Australian news about patient access as well as concentrate on sharing and research and upcoming research in Australia and from around the world thank you very much so I'll now invite all of the panelists from tonight and Thomas might be joining us but in McGregor is from the Lambert initiative and you can light up your video cameras and microphones I will try and go through some other questions so let me just stop sharing my screen everyone's yeah all right I'll start going through some of the questions if you the viewer still has a one that you would like to pop down just use that question-and-answer button rather than the chat button so for the dementia trial Amanda I might quickly check with you what strength of the product we're using or what ratio the THC to CBD we're using a 30 to 2 ratio so a higher amount of THC compared to CBD yep so it's the 3/2 - awesome okay and someone else has asked as well what regimen did you use for that trial for dementia so I think maybe they mean how often per day or night so for the first two days then you get it once a day in the afternoon so what 2 p.m. is the first dose for the first two days and then they get it twice a day from 8 a.m. and then also get it 2 p.m. with the dose increasing on the 2 p.m. dose on days where I think it is increasing okay cool all right I'll go to the insomnia trial I don't know Jen is around hey Jen it's a similar question in terms of strength I guess if you could cover what it was for those patients and at night I'm guessing yeah sure there's a couple of beds a couple of questions that have already had sent on through the Q&A about this the formulation is actually proprietary but I can tell you that it's a combination of THC CBD and CBN and yet as you've already said it was taken at nighttime about an hour before clay we're expected to although planning to go to space okay cool and we we can certainly look at sending out a link as well with some of the research that has already been published but if you're savvy enough you can do it yourself as well like I did before this hmm let's see what else we have dr. ego at Cooper which has asked the combination of THC and CBD for a glioblastoma what was that again Janet sorry have to confused everyone oh no that's okay we compared a 1 to 1 of CBD THC to a 4-1 of high THC to CBD and our one to one was basically just around five milligrams per milliliter per boat just like the under the water one was basically 15 milligrams per milliliter 23.8 milligrams per milliliter and then the results from one or the other what did you find with Timmy reduction with the tumor reduction what we actually found was we didn't actually compare that because either because it was only a snapshot so we asked like we didn't have an efficacy as our primary outcome it was actually tolerability but we did actually find with their quality of life information that the one to one was actually better than a four to one the 41 was actually better was actually found a better for pain in a range of different areas but the one to one was the majority okay cool I might ask this next one for Charlene actually because I think you would look a lot into this and whether studies are using isolates so a CBD or THC or a combination of the two molecules as full plant extracts I guess what do you tend to see with research at the moment and why do they choose one or the other it's not very many that I've seen in Australia there's a few of the commercial entities of doing some synthetic kind of adult studies but mostly I'm seeing their whole plant extractive product yeah I agree commercially as well does anyone else have anything to add I guess with with the trials that you decided to start and and whether you chose an isolator or not and why not really I'm happy to talk we did a review leading up to it and the isolates were not as effective as the whole plain extract and what we did is we have Justin Sinclair on board as an investigator and he looked into it very closely and that the most of benefits is that we we look at CBD and THC but reality is there's like 140 different cannabinoids and other components 303 hundred different components of medicinal cannabis that we still don't know the benefits of and in an isolate you don't actually get that whole component and I think that when we're looking at what is of benefit we need to actually consider it as a home and a plant that has a whole synergy and that entourage type of fit and we still have so much more tonight yeah that's very true and particularly with the literature out there with with that synergy behind it there was another one for yourself Jana in terms of can you comment a little bit more about the importance and the benefits of multidisciplinary cannabis research in cancer and do you think that the quality of life and the sleep benefits is product and/or cannabinoid or terpene specific or if it's more general and of this specific this is a really interesting cohort that we're actually looking at and Moe you know we have a high majority of who are actually on dexamethasone which obviously affects their sleep in general and I think it number one the first question that was answered was is it important for multi-discipline absolutely you know I actually think that it's imperative that we have a whole different range of teams with different specialities and professions to be able to help different cohorts and that does not just for GPM and cancer it goes across like all different special particularly chronic health conditions and I think that the more that we can work as a multi-discipline the better they will actually be for the patients and for me it's always a patient-centered it should always be patient-centered you know moving forward if we look at what is most benefit do I think that it's the cannabinoids do I think is actually cannabis are actually helpful for sleep it's very it's really hard to say you probably in Jennifer's better to enter the distinct question than then I am we had like it was highly statistically significant was like one zero zero one but asleep that they have to benefit off but we did a single dose basically an hour before bed and you got the THC how to compose what we found the one to one just worked just both getting to sleep inform or them who at this stage we don't know and Michael will be better to answer the same question that I am alright if you want to add an on Jennifer that's fine there's not been enough trials really to say definitively that yes you know it does assist to be displayed however there is a lot of uncontrolled there are a lot of uncontrolled studies and a lot of anecdotal data which indicates that it does benefit sleep in terms of the ratio and which cannabinoids as you say there's so much work to be done I'm curious Janet how do you quantify mistake what was your matrix was it self-reported I've reported so we had a number of different questionnaires that we were actually using and we had a daily diary that we did but we didn't have a band or anything that was actually recording it like yours was because it was just a secondary outcome yes ever so understanding of the benefits of slate that will force think insomnia he's from trials exactly like yours where it's a secondary outcome measure yes all right let's hit the topic of driving now so Ian thank you for joining us for tonight and have you had results from the driving study influenced some of the Australian driving regulations particularly in relation to THC levels not yet and forgive me I don't have video tonight so I got a picture of a qualls but yet I was surprised actually didn't ask Tom about his most recent studies been over in the Netherlands for the past year he commented on that at the end story simulator studies are great but where the rubber really hits the road is when you've got people with real cars on real roads and that's just exactly what he did in the Netherlands was very adventurous study Ian so one of the major issues there was whether CDE vaporised CBD actually affected driving in the same way as THC and you know surprised I think to this audience to find out that CBD didn't impair your driving at all well THC we did get some impairment and a major issue we were trying to resolve with that study was duration of impairment when you talk to patients they really want to know how long should I wait after taking my medicinal cannabis before I Drive and so we went after that quite deliberately in the onboard study and we found that at four hours basically the impairment we saw at one hour had dissipated that was with fan THC only cannabis THC CBD one to one and then with CBD cannabis so we hope these results will provide some clarity to patients but also perhaps impinge on I guess the the regulatory space the legal space around cannabis and driving I think Tom made a very important point as well that if you take oral products there is also the possibility that there'll be an extended intoxication the THC beyond four hours that we see the vaporized the other issue that we're going to go after in our next study is whether you get tolerance to driving impairment and there's already a little bit of a literature suggesting that if you're a habitual user then you're a lot less impaired than an occasional user and all the work that tom has done today there's been with occasional users where we seem quite clear impairment in terms of their driving capability for for up to three to four hours so these are important things that will feed back into hopefully the regulatory space but at this point in time I would recommend the patients and we get asked this all the time how long should I wait I give it at least four hours if you're using rural products maybe six okay and I'm much when I cut professor macro Falasca and ask you I guess what the next plan is for you with the human trials if if that's gonna be happening here in W a in terms of what you've discovered from doing in vitro yeah we hope so I think we are for the data we had so far we are ready to start its of course there are many things we are now there are many complexities starting from the dosage a good combination trying to find the best combination so of course this takes time because you need to taking the long way because we need to do a proper study and but I think we can start I hope we can start very soon awesome yeah absolutely but I think with we have some clear response by now and with these clear response I think we can move forward coffee is not that thing else yeah are you looking at it as well in terms of the aspect of so endocrine system and cell metabolism with diabetes because I I just diabetes educator course so we are in touch medicinal cannabis at all as a topic in in our course so yeah we are investigating on death aspect and of course compared to the cancer field which behind but it's also very interesting ok am I going through another question from the question answer button so someone's asked if an indica strain of legal cannabis oil is recommended for best sleep and helping with insomnia rather than sativa dominant type of cannabis extract from the oils and products that are out there on the market that question kind of confused me sorry I think what they're trying to say is whether one strain is more beneficial than another Janet I mean Jen sorry I think I've got a lifetime of research to do answers about strains and and formulations I think there's so much we don't know Co the answer unfortunately is it's not being done so yeah that's what the question was is it was indica in any other formulations that none of the ones that I know of actually have indicates or based on the black market uses indica yes where we also see it issues so there's still a lot of research to be done yeah and it's kind of interesting as well that we don't tend to find out her pain levels and it's not something that's reported but obviously we're gonna have different terpenes in indicas and sativas and that's where we're finding the big differences so um yeah maybe in future years we'll we'll see these kind of come to the forefront a bit more and I would love to see more research or knowing what typing levels are eating research projects going forward yes the two things were measured in our trial and I actually can't tell you what they are like off the top of my head I can't remember but yeah in its proprietary unfortunately yeah vision actually announced as well so we actually have them right because I'm sure that would you know help base what conditions you'll be looking at knowing that information okay I had a question come through my email and it was asking as well whether you've been approached by patients using cannabis already and on chemotherapy or whether they're considering it or yes many I received many inquiries from patients and I know there is you think I always suggest them to to do it with approval of the of the clinicians and colleges this is obviously the best way forward not always the oncology supported but I know they're a good response of course these are negative oh these are not proper trials but there are very you know in Bank attic cancer if you have positive outcome it's unfortunately not so common for the Foyt's it's it's meaningful but of course we need formal scientific proof with with the trials but yes there are many patients that are especially for pancreatic cancer that are interested in using yeah I agree we're getting a lot of phone calls as well from patients here at Hill House where sometimes it's even their family members calling up and saying we'll come too scared to tell the doctor and shoot I should know should I stop should I start on a higher dose oh yeah it's it's very common Amanda someone did ask as well whilst we were chatting if you decided on using the 3 to 2 ratio of the oral spray for your dementia trial or yeah did you get to choose that because of research that you thought was appropriate that was decided by our industry partners so the the more from the lab where the products and stuff is it's grown and manufactured so it was a product that was given to us to then test so we had no say from the research perspective what that ratio was going to be at the stage yeah okay and was that was only conducted in W as that right are you thinking to spread it to other states potentially later down the track yeah currently it's only in W a we do have contacts over Melbourne stuff that we're hoping to expand to it at some stage yet we'd love to go national if we have that opportunity okay what's them I might go through one more with Ian I'll bring you back with a question on impairment someone has asked if so they look they're asking with administration or the use of short released he hates e with methods such as they thing if that was potentially less impairment using a slow-release if it would be a potentially less impaired patient if they were using a an oil so a slower slower release type of product I think Tom mentioned in his video a little bit about this and the onset and duration yes that's right I mean basically if you vaporize or small so you get a very sudden spike of THC one Street in the brain which does give rise you impairments if you use an oral product you're gonna kind of ramping up with THC in the bloodstream which Peaks around about three hours that lasts a bit longer it's got a longer longer tail so there's an interesting difference there with regions administration yeah the other thing for I think to say about cannabis and driving is the subtlety of the impairment so we see a moderate increase in what's called a standard deviation of lateral position which basically a reminder you we've a little bit of an increase of weaving which is equivalent to say about 105 of alcohol if you have a pretty big cause of the cannabis but at the same time unlike alcohol and patients on cannabis and people on cannabis tend to leave of larger distance between themselves and the car in France and they also tend to drive west feet then people who are not on cannabis so it's almost I think what we we know is that people on cannabis had insight into the moment I'm gonna tend to compensate all that and this tends to fall through to everything you know our little sons of practice where compared to alcohol the effect on cannabis on crash risk in culpability which ultimately actually very modest in sometimes mystically can be discerned so there's a lot more to learn and just like Amanda you know we're asleep I think we can do driving studies into the future sorry mind it would be dementia and also the studies with sleep there's enough school to just keep on going with all sorts of different routes of administration different cannabinoid profiles there's an awful lot to learn and it's so important in this way definitely alright well we've got another one that's come through um let me just find what I thought was interesting TB gene has there been any research on the benefits of this one Charlene I might start with you but I think to reply to that please Marie I'm sure I know that there has obviously pre-clinical but I can't tell you any details I just can't remember at the moment but yes right I'm sure Ian's got something to say though I could go on all night about CVG you know there's this phrase CVG is the new CBD but but it isn't it's very different and in a lot of ways to CBD but in strongly anti-inflammatory there's potential effects on anxiety and some of the animal models we're seeing it actually does opposite things to CBD and as a very different your receptor a profile in terms of what it hits there's probably a niche for CBG but it certainly isn't the new CBD it's something completely different I've been where a phase one trials with CVG that are going on with North America at the moment so this is first in human trials of CVG isolate been conducted by a colleague of mine so once they rapport we'll know a lot more about CBD in humans all right there's so many other molecules as well so we could go night but I'll have to stop there thank you so much to everyone for joining us for tonight and particularly the panelists thanks so much for taking your time to even record with us before all this and you all look wonderful and the same as the original videos so what I wanted to mention was will be we have recorded this and we'll put it up on YouTube as well and we'll send you out all the link after this and our next webinar is actually going to be on patient stories same time on Wednesday night and that's in on the 12th of August so keep your eye out for that in the emails and I just want to say again thanks for everyone for joining us and have a good night Oh"

nv0mf_-NyO8,The Future Of: Medicinal Cannabis,2020-07-17T07:31:32Z,what we do know about opioid epidemic is that you know last year in the US dozens more people that died of opioid overdose and they did car accidents in the United States so it is a massive problem does make all cannabis is is it is it this amazing drug that will that will you know decrease the opioid you know deaths around the world you know there's lots of work to be done in that space but it there seemed to be the early stages are talking about some complementary capabilities we're conducting with them a number of clinics across Australia we're looking at some investigator led trials to actually see if there is a no pure drop-off and even a slight drop-off in patient opioid use with an increase use of medical based cannabis we think is a really positive thing
ya8Y-QJgRBE,From Criminal To Patient in Australia - Medicinal Cannabis Vlog Part 1,2020-04-20T03:31:04Z,taking both of these medications before but a loss for a flower so one of my friends had a few minor medical issues and he told me that it was quite easy to get medical marijuana I'm quite interested in it for myself so I was just happy trying to find one that's as clear as possible my friend told me that he just went online first and found all the information and then took that into his GP go look for something that offers flat rate so I can see how much on pain before us right now so from what I can see in most of these clinics on advertising at pricing on consultations or the actual medicine itself booked a screening consult now the purpose of a screening appointment is to see if you may be suitable for Medical Campus go through our process and answer any of your questions patients that booking for a screening appointment will have this site waived from your initial doctor's appointment me the next available because next Tuesday trying I've got work next Tuesday don't actually offer after-hours appointments okay go to email here so I'll definitely get that call on Tuesday and then put in the email the consent form and the doctor of the row form so that makes it really easier than just just print them and then take them in to my doctor probably this weekend's it gets gets done and then by the time they call on Tuesday I'll have everything ready all right so that's everything done so I've just printed the patient consent form and doctor referral form so I'll read through it now and see what the details are before I sign anything our doctor can consult patients at our physical clinic or nationwide through our video base telehealth service our medical team is backed by an allied health team with deep knowledge and experience in regulatory requirements for medicinal cannabis approvals so it just goes through like the risk factors and side-effects how you are like possess and transport them so under the number-8 position and transport it says it is an offense under the drug misuse Act to administer and can definitely cannabis-based product which has not been approved for use before transporting medicinal cannabis across the state or international borders patients should inquire with the relevant authorities regarding certain legality of this and like if the government's gonna know I can't wait now that's a big thing for me anything I'm gonna grab my name on an Opel college so if you're a general practitioner start saying and doesn't know anything about medicinal kind of just tell me that that's what the specialist is for that's why you need to be referred to the specialist so they can inform me more about it it's not a huge job with their job [Music] now I'm not reading just can I turn down by my two regular doctors I don't have the condition that's on the TG approve this this looks ridiculous no thank you the doctors comfortable with taking my case and to the TDA to the TTH my case like in the morning I'd like and as well that raises red flags - the CGA my doctor gives applying and and on the big boys awesome he accepted to applying for both I lost sure the THC intake form I'm used to so yeah next Monday at the same time smoking paper I vaporizer we generally see how things are going any adjustments that we need to awesome thank you so much for your help I just went to the chemist if you got my script I had it already waiting for me it's taken me probably about three weeks to get and we've got that a flower so dried cannabis sativa five grams it contains six point three percent THC and eight percent CBD with the oil this one is five point three nine seventeen HC and ten point two six percent CBD I've heard really good things about CBD oil and its benefits so I'm actually very keen to try the oil on it all really by the flower I've tried quite a lot so this one should be interesting to test I'll check out their Lauer and we say what it looks like compared to right this isn't what I was expecting this is like already chopped feels almost like heavily yeah it feels like you're starting to Italy not quite as hard almost feels like seeds very sure I don't even know why I would compare it to like almost like the artificial grain if you look really closely but it's okay there's a smell but it's quite um meat it's not very so very strong but it's legal so even though the bun doesn't like not exactly what I was expecting I'm trying to get those I can't judge a book by it's a lot of fun yeah I'm so excited to finally be legal not being a criminal and I'm gonna find my CV or judge 2 or 3 and J always case scenario like

5N_QopFYfU8,Growing medicinal marijuana in the Rocky Mountain state | 60 Minutes Australia,2020-02-14T08:00:00Z,"I had some firm and I thought informed views about using marijuana as medicine especially for children but what I've just seen has changed my thinking altogether and are not alone politicians doctors and patients are doing the same in parts of America prescription pot is legal and many believe saving lives there's now a green rush to legalize cannabis for medicine nationwide here though it's a crime forcing Australian families to break the law to help their children but they don't have to do that in the rocky mountain state of Colorado where I've just been to investigate how the medical marijuana business works in practice and to meet the little girl who's helped change the laws across America this is Charlotte V a happy seven-year-old but a couple of years ago that wasn't the case I was actually praying for her to just pass because it was so difficult to watch her struggle and what kind of a life was that for her person I thought it would just be better for her to just die peacefully in her sleep some night and I and I you know it's hard to admit that but I thought that would be better than going through what she was going through every 30 minutes you were losing your daughter I was losing her this is what Charlotte and her mum paige figi were dealing with every 30 minutes [Music] it's heartbreaking but important to watch as this one video has almost single-handedly changed America's medical marijuana laws every seizure took something from her if it was words or speech or walking or you know motor skills she would wake up and come out of the seizure and loot have lost something that we had to regain so we were always reteaching skills and she'd lose him and reteaching skills and and then she just started to decline in regress when she was five she really hit her her lowest point Charlotte has dravet syndrome a very rare genetic mutation that causes epilepsy and is mostly untreatable running out of time and options the Figge family turned to cannabis oil and after just a few drops Charlotte's life changed immediately and the results were the results were amazing she was 300 seizures a week 300 falling down grand mal seizures a week to zero after the first week of medicine but one not one seizure [Music] how would that little girl be today without taking cannabis while she's now two and a half years older I'm not sure she would have lived for another two and a half years alan shackelford is Charlotte's doctor and a founding member of the cannabis Business Alliance he says no one predicted the dramatic turnaround this was Charlotte's last resort it was her last resort what changes did you see in once she started taking the cannabis dramatic changes I really didn't know what quite what to expect but to be perfectly frank I was astounded at her complete failure to have seizures complete lack of seizures here in Colorado weed is welcome in fact this is America's Medical Marijuana testing ground more than a hundred thousand patients access medical cannabis in this state and 285 of those are under the age of 18 so while Australia debates the pros and cons of cannabis the reality is all around me [Music] for more than a decade Colorado has been one of now 23 American states where residents can access prescription Pop for everything from cancer to glaucoma but it's what this plant called Charlotte's Web is doing for children with epilepsy that has the whole world watching we grow medical marijuana and a strain of Charlotte's Web to the tune of about 80 85 percent of our current crops and that's grown specifically right now for intractable epilepsy and most of those cases are pediatric cases so it's it's quite controversial weed for kids it's that's what we grow it for this it is quite controversial weed for kids I mean that's an interesting business that you find yourself in it is I I would have never imagined that this would have taken the direction that it had [Music] every one of our strains you can smell with that strain is supposed to be Joel Stanley and his brothers are one of Colorado's biggest cannabis cultivators the five siblings who look more like a boyband than dope dealers are the new face of America's burgeoning marijuana business if you would have told me that I was going to grow medical marijuana for kids I would have rolled around on the ground laughing so hard so no I mean that that whole side of it's just been a shock but once people understand what it is the controversy goes away Stanley Brothers now trait hundreds of patients and have 8000 more on their waiting list to access Charlotte's Web cannabis strain named after their star patient this strain is low in THC the part that makes them on high and is rich in cannabidiol or CBD a non psychoactive ingredient scientists believe the CBD modulates chemical activity which helps quiet the excessive activity in the brain that causes seizures this is a weed for kids can it make them high you know this is a non psychoactive plant so the the the psychoactive compound within cannabis known as THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is very low in this plant so it really qualifies as a hemp strain so instead of calling it marijuana or medical marijuana what cannabis really technically it's hemp it's really him would you consider moving to the United States to receive medical marijuana for Zerlina absolutely we'd do anything for her to try that Australian Sally white is one of the 8,000 waiting to access Charlotte's Web [Music] the Sunshine Coast mum's 16 month old daughter czar Lea has a cardi syndrome suffering as many as 40 seizures a day but because she's in Australia she can't legally access cannabis water it's ridiculous there are other children that are taking medical marijuana in Australia through illegal means we don't want to do that sally has enough brain trauma already that fast to try something that isn't tested it could be quite detrimental to her health we can't risk that either but there are children that are benefitting from it but our only option is to go to America it is ridiculous it's an impossible dilemma isn't it it's a nightmare we don't want to do it but what do you do to you what she sees you till she dies Sally hopes Australia will follow the Colorado [Music] when you step inside a cannabis greenhouse you quickly realize how regulated this business is each plant is bar-coded every detail able to be monitored by state officials every plant has an RFID tracking chip on it so that if one plant moves from from one building to another within a grow that registers in some system so we call it seed to sale tracking there are more of these medical marijuana dispensaries in Colorado than there are Starbucks coffee shops and in America that is saying something but while on the surface this states liberal laws looked like easy solutions to so many illnesses it's hard to ignore that the science and medical research just isn't there yet in fact some studies say marijuana is bad for brain development and can lead to addiction like any drug medical marijuana will have to undergo rigorous clinical trials before anyone can categorically say that it works and long term it's safe what is known is that between 2012 and April this year the Children's Hospital Colorado has treated 29 children for adverse effects to medical marijuana two of those had severe side effects requiring admission to intensive care not all cases involve charlet web but according to the hospital all were high in CBD if there are no trials if there are no human trials then how do you know what the long term effects of medical cannabis are going to be it's a very important question there isn't any evidence from that hundred years of clinical use to treat a variety of different conditions that it had any negative impact whatsoever but the area of concern is that now that you're using medical cannabis for children that you don't know the long-term effects that's an important point and I think we have to always bear in mind what are the potential benefits what are the potential risks when medically you're taking a huge risk oh yeah legally you're taking a huge risk as well yeah yep Brisbane mum lanai Carter is taking a bigger risk than most traveling from Australia to America to access medical marijuana for her desperately ill son Lindsay she fears by speaking to us she may be banned from America but is determined for our government to hear her story we feel this is a battle we have to fight we have to fight it quickly we don't have a lot of time on our hands because we don't know how long he's gone from an immigration point of view yes are you meant to be traveling to America and doing this I don't know all I know is that there were doctors there that believe that this boy needs this treatment to help save his life [Music] the nice son Lyndsey has a brain tumor resulting in daily seizures headaches and nausea chemotherapy won't work and surgery could make things worse they believe their last roll of the dice is a type of cannabis oil it strikes me that you you've become marijuana refugees yes we did I guess you can call off that mm-hmm-hmm we did you know seeking out medical treatment in a country that is so far from home but when such limited options are on the table or the options that are on the table are such high risk we we had no other choice you will do anything to travel to get that treatment yes do anything to save our son [Music] what's your message to parents in Australia who are in that desperate situation of wanting to access this to help their children this is worthwhile to fight for and it might be an uphill battle and your government is saying no no way this is a worthwhile thing to fight for 100% and don't give up ahh-choo he blows and he sneezes in the hall for now America is in the unusual situation where personal anecdotes rather than science are changing laws here in Australia desperate patients are hoping those anecdotes will also be heard by our lawmakers sometimes I feel like saying to these politicians will swap children you take my baby and what try seizure all day long and I'll take your healthy kid and run around the park and pretend that life's great and you decide what you're gonna do are you gonna get it illegally or are you going to do everything you can to get it here somehow being a politician that do something if it was their kid but they obviously don't have sick kids because there's no way that's it they're not do anything hello I'm Liam Bartlet thanks for watching so keep up with the latest from 60 minutes Australia make sure you subscribe to

sZ34Le2FvTw,A Recap of Medical Cannabis In Australia 2020 - This Month In Cannabis EP:6,2020-12-28T21:46:53Z,hey everyone tom brown here for episode six of this month in cannabis and this month in cannabis we're going to be giving you an overview of 2020 and all the things that happened in cannabis in australia or most of the things that happen in cannabis in australia and a little bit of worldwide information today as usual i'm here with reese cohen and and we'll just get straight into it to make sure that you get a nice recap of the year leading into the holidays and happy holidays to everyone who's watching um so reese to get us started can you give us an overview of maybe patient population and how medicinal cannabis or the medicinal cannabis space has grown over the last year we started off the year with probably around 15 000 australians who were actively taking a you know were current and active medicinal cannabis patients prescribed patients that's probably at least doubled um at now so we're probably at least at around 30 000 patients uh actively taking a prescription cannabis product but it's become increasingly difficult to uh identify and forecast how many patients there are partly because there are so many more authorized prescribers now so authorized prescribers have also roughly doubled this year and the way they count patients and report patients is different and also because of the extraordinary rise of compounding uh medicinal cannabis products which doesn't require any approval from anyone really um and therefore these people are not counted um so that's in terms of you know sort of patience in terms of um you know what kinds of patients i think we've seen at the continuing rise of people seeking medicinal cannabis for psychiatric conditions um mostly anxiety and anxiety related conditions but also ptsd so that's been an interesting trend that's continued this year we've had a bunch of new products come online you know we're up to now over 150 products that are available for doctors to prescribe um and you know a lot of them look very similar to each other but we have seen some new um you know capsules gel caps wafers and other interesting product forms come online this year yeah great maybe you can talk a tiny bit more about compounding and what that is and what that means for patients and doctors well so compounding pharmacists uh pharmacies are can uh create a a specific preparation uh on on prescription from a doctor according to their specifications so you know often it's um you know for example uh like a a particular topical cream for a skin condition or something that that isn't you know commonly available but is easy to sort of um to to create um if you have the right qualifications and equipment so these compounding pharmacies are licensed to do this and they are allowed to create products on a per patient basis so the patient comes in with the request and the prescription which specifies the product and then the pharmacist goes away and creates that preparation for them and and dispenses it to that patient so this includes cannabis medicinal cannabis products and it's becoming an increasingly popular way for uh for patients to get access to medicinal cannabis because these products are uh don't have to be manufactured in a gmp good manufacturing practice pharmaceutical quality level manufacturing facility um they are held to a lower quality standard because they're meant to be done on a very um custom and individual you know sort of short-term kind of basis i guess would be the right way to describe it um on the topic of product and we'll continue down that path briefly can you talk about some of the new and maybe interesting products that patients might be want to know more about that have entered the market this year well i guess it depends on what you're after for me the most interesting thing that happened this year in terms of products were the new holy australian cultivated holy australian manufactured products that have come online so i i find that tremendously exciting i think that's a very healthy sign for the industry you know local products locally cultivated locally manufactured products are how we achieve product affordability in the long term um it's taken us a long time to get to where we are now and we're starting to see more of that come online which is really encouraging now let's jump into some research so recently the lambert initiative for cannabinoid therapeutics published a study that talked a lot about cannabis and driving that's both cbd and thc that was by tom arkell can you maybe give us a little overview on on those findings yeah so tom went over to the netherlands as part of his phd and with uh john ray makers who's an academic over there at the university of maastricht ran an on-road driving study looking at the way in which different cannabis strains affect people's driving performance so participants either got placebo cannabis which has no cannabinoids in it a thc high thc cannabis a high cbd cannabis maybe it was a combination as well but the idea was to um get people inhaling cannabis and some of them got got stoned uh through a vaporizer and then getting them in a dual controlled car uh with an instructor sitting next to them with a brake pedal and uh going out on the highways in the netherlands and driving around uh and these cars are rigged up with lots and lots of very sensitive instruments which measured um things like you know how long people how far people will leave a gap in front of them to the next car you know how likely they are to to stay in their lane or weave and the results uh were published recently and the results were basically that um thc impairs people's driving ability that impairment appears in this study to fade off at around you know four four four or six hours afterwards um and cbd did not protect from the impairing effects of thc in this study um so that was uh that was one interesting finding and cbd alone did not seem to impair people's driving ability um at all which is obviously relevant for what's going on in australia at the moment we're taking another look at our cannabis and driving laws i also wanted to point out that you know we know you've been in or you were part of a study that happened a little while ago released about three or four months ago about cbd maybe you can talk a little bit about that as well yes i was a co-author or a middle author um on a uh on a publication that was in the international journal of drug policy that came out yeah a little while ago uh and this was once again to be headed by the lamb initiative and ian mcgregor was the i was the first author on that what we did was we we managed to survey um a whole bunch of countries around the world you know australia new zealand japan canada germany a few others and looking at the way in which those countries uh regulate access to cbd without a prescription so in many other parts of the world it's relatively easy to as a consumer walk into a shop or go online and buy a cbd product and what we found was generally speaking cbd is not well regulated or not strongly regulated and these products are generally quite accessible often they they operate in a bit of a legal gray area so you know maybe they are or are not meant to be accessed that way you know it's a bit unclear i think the general one of the general sort of um conclusions of the paper was uh it seems like these products are rather accessible um and not very well regulated globally and despite that we have yet to see any any obvious signs of population level risks or harms that that may be caused by these products absolutely and i think that you know and we'll jump into local laws now i think this is a good transition um as people may know last week um you know the tga decided that we would down schedule cbd maybe you can tell people a little bit about what this means a timeline and how that'll all work the timeline's actually gotten shorter so you know i think it was september was the interim decision and the interim interim decision said uh okay we only want products that have been registered on the artg to be made available so none of these unregistered products that we see in the prescription medicinal cannabis space uh and you know companies will need to prove that their products are effective at 60 milligrams a day was the was the interim decision and you know whatever decision is made will be implemented mid 2021. so what happened in the final decision was that actually the the recommended daily dose was increased from 60 to 150 milligrams a day which is great and the implementation date was moved forward so this will now be in effect in february next year um so quite a quite a change quite a significant shift from the interim decision to the final decision largely based on what i can see on a really well done targeted and effective engagement from community industry and the scientific community providing some more thorough uh assessments of the potential risks of these products to the delegate who made the decision so one of the other questions i want to ask you on that is do you actually think that that companies will have cbd over the counter by february 20th and do you think no absolutely not by february 2021 so so what what likely what companies will need to do is uh first of all uh make sure that they have a product that is appropriate you know there's a bunch of technical product development r d that will need to happen first then uh those companies will need to probably run reasonably large placebo-controlled clinical trials using those drugs and then of course those clinical trials will need to produce a compelling uh result the products will need to be proven that they are more effective than a placebo to a certain extent and then there's all of the you know application processes are getting all your documentation together this is a you know this is not a small task so you know maybe by the end of 2022 there's a chance we'll see these maybe see these products become available um but there's no guarantee that any of these products will actually become available because it will require them to be proven to be effective and we're not sure that well that research basically hasn't been done before yet so it's uh it is a bit of a gamble let's talk about tasmania and i i know that a lot of people don't actually know some of the challenges that are going on in tasmania i think this is a good one to talk about so the tasmanian government really does love to tout the fact that they're the only government that subsidizes medicinal cannabis and on the face of it that sounds great there's a quote from sarah courtney the health minister of tasmania saying the tasmanian government is the only government in australia to subsidize the cost of highly expensive medicinal cannabis products and make their potential benefits accessible to tasmanians not only those who can afford to pay now again that sounds great but less than 20 tasmanians have been approved for medicinal cannabis since 2016 in tasmania and we do know that some tasmanians have gone to clinics that are interstate and have been prescribed as well but via the tasmanian process less than 20. um so in your opinion reese can you talk a little bit about what's going on here and why that's happening i have no idea why this is happening i think i think it made sense initially you know in the early days of 2016 2017 um when medicinal cannabis was brand new when no one knew how it was going to work or what it was going to look like you know and this was the time when every state and territory had their own additional uh restrictions on who could get access to what and which doctors could prescribe and the paperwork um and that was completely unworkable um and obviously unworkable so in mid or early sort of 2018 um the uh greg hunt the federal health minister um you know sort of herded the the cats so to speak and through through the coag process managed to get all of the states and territories to agree um to to you know collaborate streamlining their patient access processes um to make sure these barriers were reduced and all of them did agree except for tasmania who decided to keep doing their own thing for whatever reason they may have so you have a situation where patients very you know in some cases quite quite seriously ill patients who've been seen by not just a gp you know gps our specialist but by a condition specialist you know so um an epileptologist or a um you know you're a psychiatrist or whatever and that specialist has submitted an application to the tasmanian government saying i believe as a specialist medical practitioner that my patient would benefit or should at least attempt to try a medicinal cannabis product and the tasmanian government has said no uh we disagree with you and you can't do that um which is really quite uh um surreal and and kind of orwellian um i think the i mean great that they subsidize uh medicinal cannabis for yeah 16 or 17 patients that's terrific but you know why wouldn't you also let medical doctors make their own decision about patient care um you know considering that that's kind of their whole job um that kind of blows my mind and then of course it's not stopping people from getting access necessarily as as you are highlighted right i mean patients can and do see other doctors in the mainland get prescribed medicinal cannabis products and have those products shipped to them in tasmania for their consumption so you know the idea that this is somehow protecting the community from harm is obviously nonsense and i find it really offensive that the government continues to to try and paint itself as a savior uh and as actually helping people when in fact they are um deliberately causing unnecessary harm and anguish um and uh it's pretty disgraceful in my opinion do you have any thoughts on what might help change this just more bad news stories um in my experience the one thing that can reliably change government minds is them looking bad in the media so you know the challenge is i think not not enough people really care about this issue at the moment to to reach critical mass uh but the more we talk about it and the more we keep you know drawing attention to it the better absolutely so i think the call to action here is if you're in tasmania um whether you know and you're watching this whether you believe in cannabis don't believe in cannabis you know this is a a real public health issue and in a lot of ways discrimination so please you know get on board talk to talk to your local government talk to people around you um and just just help help change this for for everyone's benefit yep call call or email your local member and let them know that you're upset about this it's the best way to do it absolutely okay great so let's transition a little bit into another legal issue which is cannabis and driving so cannabis and driving is a huge issue at the moment huge topic at the moment um industry patients really australia-wide we should be talking a little bit more about this um and so you know fiona patton's been working towards changing the driving laws with relation to medicinal cannabis specifically since pretty much since medicinal cannabis uh became legalized can you talk a little bit about fiona's history with changing the law with the reason party and and kind of where we're at today yeah well i mean you're right it was identified as an issue way back in 2016. it just took a bit of a critical mass of patience i think to to force everybody's hands so yeah fiona's been working on this as have you know many others but i think she's really spearheaded a lot of the great progress that we've seen in the last few months and so the point of which we got up to a little while ago was that fiona and the recent party had managed to get the government to agree to form um some kind of working group or committee uh that was going to take a serious and close look at you know how the dragon balls operate at the moment with regards to medicinal cannabis patients who are legally prescribed and not impaired all right so uh what was the outcome then reese yeah well unfortunately you know we haven't seen that uh committee table its recommendations yet which is a bit of a shame uh but you know hopefully we'll see something come out early next year you know because really this issue isn't getting any less pressing you know there are you know more and more medical cannabis patients uh encountering this concern you know with each day that goes past so you know we really need to make sure this happens quickly in victoria and around the country as well absolutely and so you know you mentioned more and more patients uh becoming prescribed there are approximately uh 35 page legal medicinal cannabis patients in australia and about seventy percent of those patients have some thc in their medication um now you know we want this law to change and it really needs to change for a number of reasons but there is a group of us who have come together to to and we will run a nationwide campaign called drive change um a little bit about the problem um currently it's illegal to drive with any thc in your system and this is usually measured at the roadside with a mouth swap now there's no evidence that mouth swabs actually improve road safety this is also a discriminatory law in its current form there's no other legally prescribed medication where a patient can lose their license just for testing positive for presence not impairment and that's a really big problem as well and finally this does have a negative impact on public health because doctors are less inclined to prescribe cannabis medication that contains thc um and even if the doctor is willing quite often patients won't want to take that medication because driving is a huge part of our lives especially in rural areas so we want to bring everyone together patients industry you know family of patients and and really get a movement going to help show the government that this law needs to change and so we have the drive change campaign where we're calling for equal rights for medicinal cannabis patients um if you want to learn more and we encourage you to come and join us and learn more about this problem and and the solution so you can come to our website which is drivechangemc.org dot a u you'll find information about your local laws um what you can do from a to to actually take action in each state you'll see who's involved and we encourage you to sign up to the newsletter or or get involved in some way so again that's drivechangemc.org dot a u we look forward to seeing you and and hopefully changing this law in 2021 australia-wide all right so just before we wrap up i'm going to put a few things up on the screen a little game show of sorts i want to talk about and you can choose either a couple of international things or a couple of local things that have happened this year that will have an impact on drug law reform cannabis whatever it is so um take your pick from what's on the screen um what's what's happened and how it impacts australia or drug drugs worldwide cool little little menu um well i mean like we've already talked a bunch about new zealand um this year so maybe that's maybe we can leave that one but i think yeah one thing we haven't really talked about much is the um the un stuff right so this was the this is pretty recent a few weeks ago now the committee uh commission on narcotic drugs um which is a law-making body within the u.n voted on the recommendations that had been made by the world health organization some time ago regarding the international control of cannabis and cannabis extracts so the who you know they did this big review the first time that these laws have been reviewed in decades and decades uh and they made some you know quite reasonable recommendations about loosening the controls on on the international controls of these substances you know the who recommended hey why don't we just like you know remove cbd entirely from this system because it's not a narcotic drug like why is it in here um and and so those were voted on recently and the one and so the recommendation that got approved was to remove uh cannabis from the schedule four of the single convention i think which is you know the extra bad um you know they basically got like you know one set of controls that say you know this is the highest level of control for all these drugs and they're very dangerous and then they've got another one that says and remember they're really dangerous so you know cannabis got removed from that one uh which is good but it it won't um change the way in which the un controls and regulates cannabis or cannabis extracts uh but it does send a really strong signal i think to member states that yes like medical cannabis is real uh it is legitimate for you to pursue medicinal cannabis programs in your countries um and you know i think that's really important we've already seen that being used in switzerland i believe by a politician there who who was arguing for an you know improvement expansion of access to medicinal cannabis in that country and they were saying look you know that the cnd uh made this vote recently and you know that's the justification for this so i think that's where we'll see the impacts of that decision is in you know the it increases the likelihood that other countries around the world will legalize medicinal cannabis australia of course we've already legalized medicinal cannabis um but it will be important for local industries you know because we're a very export-focused um sector here and uh and that's good the other thing was um yeah some some some really encouraging sort of drug law reform in general stuff that's come out of the states and territories in australia so we saw a few weeks ago that you know new south wales cabinet is considering a proposal to de-penalize the possession of small amounts of all illicit drugs so it's not decriminalization necessarily like the criminal penalties would still be there that wouldn't change but um they would uh basically put in place and this is the proposal anyway a bit of a three strikes kind of system so you know with escalating levels of fines and penalties until uh you get run through the courts for possessing drugs um so you know it's it's a it's an extension of our sort of drug diversion programs that we have in new south wales already and it would be it would be a good thing it'd be better than keeping it the way it is at the moment it doesn't really go far enough in my opinion for example it won't stop um the incentive for police to strip search children at music festivals which is happening quite a lot still um but the the other really exciting thing was um in the act where a member of parliament there has proposed uh the true decriminalization of the possession of small quantities of all illicit drugs um so that's you know just recognizing that that drug consumption and drug use is a social and health problem it's not a criminal problem um you know yeah your criminal syndicates are responsible for manufacturing and you know international transport of you know kilograms of meth and whatever and sure you know go after them but we know when it comes down to to everyday people who you know use drugs uh personally that's a health issue that's not a that's not a criminal issue it's not helpful to treat them as such uh so this is you know similar to policies we see in places like portugal and some parts of north america now and you know if that goes through i think that would be just uh tremendous you know it would it would make it the first place in australia to my knowledge to to go that far in terms of dragon ball reform um and it's good policy it just makes a lot of sense all the evidence that we have from every jurisdiction that has decriminalized possession of small amounts of illicit drugs has found that it has improved public health and reduced costs for police and prisons and courts so um yeah more of that please um it's just nice to see you know something shift in australia in terms of travels you know we do have a long way to go but as you pointed out before um some really positive stuff has happened in 2020 um and you know i think 2021 is looking pretty good um so is this anything else i was just going to say anyway is there anything else you want to say to people before we wrap up um i've got no other questions and i think we've covered everything what a year what are you in cannabis what a year to be alive yeah very true very true okay well i think that's all behind us yeah i think that's a great way to wrap up thank you for being here rhys thank you to everyone who's watching and joined us for these six episodes of this month in cannabis um next year we're probably going to start doing these quarterly um i think we can do we'll do it a little bit different um but it's been a lot of fun it's been great great spending time with you rhys thank you for sharing your knowledge with me with us um and yeah happy holidays happy new year to everyone and yeah we'll see in 2021 hanukkah christmas etc yeah yeah exactly awesome all right well thanks catch you in 20 next

zmJcJUDt8L0,DVA Funding For Medical Cannabis In Australia Explained By Clare Barker,2020-11-05T10:04:13Z,hi i'm claire barker the general manager from ontura i'm here with honolee today to talk about the dva funding process and how we can assist veterans in getting access to funded medicinal cannabis to help with any of their their ongoing conditions the simple answer to that is the dva does provide funding for medicinal cannabis and there is a process involved and i will actually take you through that today the dpa will consider request for funding for any conditions however they do have certain conditions that have a determination that will obtain easier funding these conditions are chronic pain multiple sclerosis palliative care chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and epilepsy in saying this other conditions such as mental health conditions including ptsd will be and have been funded and i'll cover the process for this momentarily so to obtain funding the condition must be chronic so you must have had your condition for greater than three months and it must be insufficiently responsive to your conventional medication so the dva does require written support from the treating specialist unless of course the um treating specialist is the person who's putting in the application and that needs to make sure that they indicate that the patient would actually get clinical benefit from the medicinal cannabis they also must state that they've gone through the potential contraindications of medicinal cannabis with the patient they also need to make sure that they have done a mental health and suicide assessment and ensure that there is no increased risk of suicide ideation with going on to the medicinal cannabis one of the other things that they need to look through is actually make an assessment about does the patient have a current substance abuse disorder or are they likely to by going on to medicinal cannabis be more susceptible to a substance abuse disorder the other thing that you need to actually provide for the dva is a tga sasb approval letter or if the doctor is an authorized prescriber your authorized prescriber approval letter so to actually get dda cover you actually need to write a letter to the dva this can be written by the doctor or the specialist if it is written by the doctor the specialist endorsement needs to be included it needs to outline the patient's condition um all the first line treatments that have actually been used it needs to detail the particular product that's been prescribed and the justification of why you have chosen that product as i mentioned the letter needs to include the special support and the documents can go in through as their attachments so this letter can be sent to the dba and the email address is v-a-c-a-p-m-c dba.gov dot a u i'll now outline the process for the two categories of conditions the first being the predetermined conditions and the second other conditions such as mental health conditions so just to kind of go over again what those predetermined conditions are that's chronic pain ms palliative care cinv and epilepsy for this process the application is reviewed by the dba pharmacist and when they are happy that all the information is correct you'll get an approval letter um get sent back to the doctor the appalling doctor may be asked to provide more information but that's not a problem the team who assess the applications are available on the phone and they're really great to deal with the doctor will be given an approval for a defined period of time and they will actually then be required to provide a clinical report of the patient outcome to continue funding beyond this predetermined period of time so then moving on to the second category which is other conditions um including mental health conditions such as ptsd the application is forward and internally within dva to specialists and they actually do an individual review at that point in time the process does take more time and the doctor may be asked to provide additional information such as validated questionnaires and a detailed monitoring plan in order for the process to be approved this may seem like a daunting process but there are a lot of people with a lot of knowledge who are there to help your doctor and your specialist and they are more than willing to do so on tour has created a simple automated process for doctors and specialists to generate the dva funding application for their patients this reduces the complexity and for the doctor and it also streamlines the process for this application if your doctor needs help submitting the dva application they can use this free tool by registering on the ontura cannabis support portal for free to register at the portal um go to ecs.ontoura.com.eiu or for patients if you're interested in getting more educational information on this dva process you can actually register the ecs portal at the same url
V_0YUkwnOMA,Understanding Cannabis Access Pathways | by Clare Barker from Entoura,2020-10-05T00:49:50Z,hi my name is claire barker i'm the general manager and global business development executive for ontura today i'm here with honolee to talk about medicinal cannabis patient access pathway and how to best prepare you to speak with your doctor about medicinal cannabis technically the eligibility laws in every state are the same but the main difference between the states is who can you go to to be prescribed medicinal cannabis queensland new south wales victoria south australia wa northern territory and act you can have a gp prescribing for you with tasmania unfortunately it's only specialists who can prescribe and they do actually have a government subsidised scheme for prescription though it is limited to the specialists so for those people in tasmania who are looking to get prescribed my first thing would be to try and see a specialist who will if not you can actually go and have tele health appointments with um cannabis clinics um within other states and actually access you your product in that manner yeah there are three ways currently that you can actually get access to medicinal cannabis in australia one is with a medical specialist prescribing you through the sas program and that can be your gp then those medical specialists and gps could actually apply to be authorized prescribers or you can actually get access through clinical trials and as i said most states gps with the exception of tasmania will be able to fill out your sas application and this is a one patient to one product application for your for your um condition with the authorized prescribers they can get authorization to prescribe a specific product for a specific class of conditions and that means that although they go through a lengthy upfront approval process once they have that they do not need to apply to tj each time they prescribe so as we've mentioned the ways that you can access to um medicinal cannabis is through um being just an application to the sas scheme you can also go through an authorized prescriber's pathway or you can actually go in through clinical trials i'll explain to you both gp clinics and also authorised prescribers look the department of veterans affairs are actually increasingly providing some subsidies for veterans it's not a given it's not an actual given but what they are doing is they're working with doctors and the doctors often find that if they actually use a validated questionnaire for the particular condition before giving treatment start the patient on treatment and then use a validated questionnaire to prove that it's working then the the department of veterans affairs are actually looking at that and often subsidizing so you may have to actually start a journey on your own but then actually pick up their support after you started the thing we need to go back to is that medicinal cannabis is an unapproved medicine and therefore not eligible for the pbs or medicare this did come up in a senate inquiry into medicinal cannabis access in 2019 and there was a recommendation to look into the medicinal cannabis readout rebates my personal opinion is that we won't see any movement for the rebates through the pbs until at least 2021. now there's not a short answer to this one um there's no ticket box the same medicinal cannabis um in your application forms but what i do know is that there has been people who have been successful in getting subsidies through the ndtis it was a lengthy process and took a tenacious um ndis specialist to work through that but if you've got someone who you can actually rely on to do that with you it's certainly worth going down that process absolutely yes and the reason is the more knowledge of how you've been using cannabis the more likely they are to be able to select the product will have the highest likelihood of success with treating your symptoms knowing your cannabis use will help everyone in the long run it helps relieve symptoms faster and actually may end up costing you less because you're likely to put on the right product the first time let's take for an example you've had chronic pain have used cannabis or a joint to medicate you've been used to smoking the joint and therefore your body is used to having thc alleviate the pain but typically you might start with a cbd only or a majority cbd product if your body has already used thc for the pain the cbd might not work enough or work effectively the doctor may choose a product that has a more thc in the beginning because of this history there is a distinct cannabis culture in places like the us and canada the australian cannabis culture is very different in the us you may have many different strains and breeds that you can access but in australia we have refined this down to pharmaceutical products we do have some variations in indie care and sativas but you won't have won't be able to ask for your favorite strain you may be able to talk to your doctor about a preference but ultimately it is their decision about what is the best product for you with the conditions that you have presented to them yes certainly one thing that i've learned is that medicinal cannabis space in australia has is evolving and has evolved a long way over the last couple of years since legalization for those of you who looked into it in the past i'd encourage you to revisit because it's actually a lot more easy to access there's a lot more doctors who are knowledgeable in this space now and also the cost is continuing to come down so what the cost of product was even 12 months ago is significantly cheaper this year so i'd encourage you to keep looking keep your information up to date visit your sites like connelly but don't give up because where everything else has failed medicinal cannabis in a lot of instances has really had the ability to change the quality of life for a lot of people thanks for joining us for today's interview about cannabis access in australia if you found this information useful and you'd like to learn more about cannabis please subscribe to our

_DhfLv_szQE,Do you need a referral to visit a cannabis clinic in Australia?,2020-05-14T05:49:05Z,uh because we're a plant made as a clinic specializing i suppose in medicinal cannabis we do prefer if you bring a referral from your gp or at least a health summary from your gp for us that gives us a point of contact for ongoing treatment and reduction of your medications and that sort of thing a gp conductor you see a lot more regularly saying that you don't need a gp referral to access medicinal cannabis from any doctor but we do prefer just for that point of contact so you either have a referral from your gp or specialist and they direct you to plant med and then we work with those doctors in any standard referral pattern we tell them when we started treatment we tell them what we've achieved and what our ongoing plans are we write them letters and communicate in an interdisciplinary way so basically you get that referral or you ring up the clinic and book yourself an appointment with with the doctors you come and sit down with us we spend at least an hour with it in the initial consult with each patient talking to them taking their history listening to what medications and their story we then make a decision on what sort of cannabis medications will suit that patient best and we submit on their behalf an application to the federal government through what's called the sas b pathway and sometimes depending on state to state the state government as well usually within a couple of days to a week we get an approval letter back for that medication and then that medication is a standard s8 legalized medication for that patient meaning they can fly with that medication they can take that medication wherever they like the only thing they have to be aware of is driving so thc and driving is a separate thing and it's a police issue and no thc is acceptable with driving in australia from that point it's a standard s8 medication so the medication can be picked up from from plant med or we can send it to a pharmacy near you or have that medication sent to you and it's a legal medication for that patient that's the process basically so you can self-refer any doctor in australia can do these applications and access medicinal cannabis for you and i said as i said the only rule as to access is it must not be a first-line treatment the ailment must have been treated with some sort of conventional medication and therapies that have proven ineffective or had too many side effects or adverse effects then medicinal cannabis is a legitimate option for that patient so the pathway is very simple now it used to be a lot more onerous on the doctor but it's been streamlined so basically we have a chat to you log on to the federal government portal submit the application a little bit after that we'll get the approval back and then the medicine is prescribed and dispensed to you as per usual we do have a at plant med we do like to check up on our patients and make sure everything's going well so we'll have a courtesy nurse call every two weeks and then on the fourth or fifth week you'll talk to the doctor and then as necessary we'll touch base once a month until we get that medication dose right once we get the dose right it tends to stay pretty steady and we just touch base for script repeats and to check up make sure everything's okay

U0zTtZ454KY,This Month In Cannabis Episode 1: AU Cannabis Overview July 2020,2020-07-21T06:24:19Z,hey i'm tom brown a founder of honolee a cannabis education hub we created honolee as a safe space for you to explore your curiosities about cannabis and to learn about the science benefits and legalities of the plant hi i'm rhys cohen i'm the principal consultant at fresh leaf analytics and we're a medical cannabis consulting and data analytics firm focusing on the australian and new zealand markets hi my name is tom brown and i'm here with my co-host rhys cohen hey we're launching our first episode of this month in cannabis and because it's our first episode we want to explain a little bit about what this will what this series will be about so this month in cannabis is going to be a monthly series with episodes running for no longer than 20 minutes we're going to update you on what you need to know about cannabis and we're going to talk about topics like patient access and patient pathways products costs the changing legal landscape and adult use cannabis so this month we're going to give you an overview of where the australian cannabis landscape is and what's happened thus far in 2020 and it's been a big year so we're going to be going through um just some high level overviews on where we're at in terms of approvals and pathways to do with medical patient access um the kinds of conditions that people are getting access for the sorts of products that are on the market at the moment um you know some information on patient expenditure and uh yeah as tom said just some ideas about what's been going on and what we have to look forward to over the next few months let's give a little bit of context um about where we're at so um the national drug and household survey of 2016 which was published by the australian institute of health and welfare and the 2016 report is the most recent one published actually shows that 35 percent of australians age 14 and plus 14 and older have used cannabis in their lifetime and a recent paper published by the in the harm reduction journal showed that one in 30 cannabis patients are actually using cannabis legally so the idea of cannabis access in australia is definitely prevalent and growing but the fact that there are only one in 30 cannabis patients using it legally shows that something really isn't quite right so reese can you paint us a picture of how legal access has changed maybe maybe over the past 12 to 18 months and where we're at today absolutely so i mean really quickly you know medical cannabis was legalized in 2016 and we're now halfway through 2020. so it's been you know sort of four years of the of the framework being in place the big changes that have happened in the last couple of years in terms of patient access has been a an improvement in terms of the bureaucracy required to navigate the approval process so it's actually it's no longer an impossible or extremely arduous task for a doctor to pursue a prescription it used to be but it's a lot easier now and that's largely thanks to the therapeutic goods administration creating this online portal where it's sort of a one-stop shop for uh requesting a prescription as far as a doctor goes in the last um 18 months or so you know we've seen patient numbers go from a trickle to you know a small stream um and uh you know we are forecasting for patient numbers to continue increasing at a pretty rapid rate uh over the coming years awesome all right reese that sounds great can you give us a bit of an idea of what the total patient numbers are today as of today and maybe also a little bit about the sas and ap numbers last month in june 2020 there were over 600 new special access scheme category b approvals issued in that month so fresh leaf we now estimate that there's over 15 000 patients who are currently as of today actively taking a medical cannabis product and we expect that to increase to 25 000 by the end of the year um the number of authorized prescribers has always been relatively low so at the moment there's 85 or so doctors in australia who have an active authorized prescriber status and in the calendar year 2019 the total number of new patients that got access to a cannabis medicine via an authorized prescriber was somewhere in the vicinity of a couple of hundred so the authorized prescriber scheme is isn't responsible for the most amount of volume in terms of patient access that's the special access scheme category b pathway but in terms of what the special access scheme actually is so the way it works is normally as a doctor you write a prescription for a medicine patient takes medicine to pharmacy pretty straightforward most of the time when we're talking about cannabis medicines in australia we're talking about unregistered medicines and so normally doctors aren't supposed to write prescriptions for unregistered medicines but there are pathways they can pursue to write prescriptions for unregistered medicines what that requires them to do is get permission from the federal government and their state or territory government give them an authorization or an approval which they then are allowed to use to write prescriptions so it's a step before writing a prescription so a doctor will log on to the online portal and you know put in an application that says you know this patient they have this condition they've tried these medications they haven't worked i think this specific cannabis medicine will be appropriate for them and i'm going to prescribe it to them at this dose they're going to take this much on a daily basis and i'm going to monitor them for side effects in these ways you know may i please have the authority to prescribe and then usually what happens is within 24 to 48 hours the government comes back and goes yeah you're ready to go here's your paperwork and and from then on it's relatively straightforward or more like writing a regular prescription um for being an authorized prescriber that's a more arduous process so that allows doctors to prescribe a specific product to a class of patients directly under their care without needing per patient approval so it's it's most useful or most appropriate for doctors who are prescribing a really high volume of cannabis medicines yeah absolutely and something to add on that is a lot of people ask well is there a list or how do i find an authorized prescriber and there isn't a list that's out there in most places around around australia so you know except for tasmania and some other nuances and some other uh jurisdictions any specialist gp is able to request the authority to prescribe an unregistered cannabis medicine it's just a question of finding someone who's educated and interested to pursue that yeah for sure and if and if your gp isn't interested or maybe is interested but doesn't have enough information there tons of um you know most of the medical cannabis product manufacturers out there have free services to help educate doctors um you know there are other companies like marijuana who who actually do educate doctors as their main business and there are a lot of rac gp courses out there as well so i think there's there's really a way for your doctor to help you and if not there are always the cannabis clinics which we won't really touch on in this episode but they can help you as well um so thanks for that reese and and i think now we'll talk a little bit about uh medical conditions being treated by cannabis um and so to start to get us into that part of this conversation a little bit of context again so with 2020 we're now midway through um throughout the first part of the year we saw a lot of information about cannabis on the news right so we saw a lot of information about cannabis and sleep and cannabis and epilepsy and cannabis and ptsd and these are some of the really serious conditions that people are struggling with and getting prescriptions for and also paying a lot of money for but there are a lot of other conditions out there that people are able to be prescribed for and are being prescribed for whether it be by an ap or through the sasb through their own gp so to talk a bit more about that can you tell us a bit more about those conditions and maybe what are some of the most common conditions that cannabis are prescribed for so you know there are dozens and dozens and dozens of unique conditions for which cannabis has been prescribed for in australia but the most common condition that people are prescribed to cannabis medicine for is some kind of chronic non-cancer related pain so whether that be muscular skeletal pain you know lower back pain migraines arthritic pain neuropathic pain those are the the conditions which comprise about 70 of all patients in australia in terms of what they're getting access to cannabis to treat okay great and can you talk maybe a little bit about some of the other conditions that are um quite prevalent in terms of prescribing um well what's been interesting is so if we if we group all of the conditions for which people are prescribed cannabis for into sort of high-level categories the biggest high-level category is chronic non-cancer pain and as i say it makes up about 70 of approvals but the second highest group of conditions is actually psychiatric conditions so you know when we think about cannabis obviously you know one of the things that some people associate cannabis with is our mental health issues you know cannabis causes mental health issues what's interesting is we're actually seeing a lot of australians be prescribed a medical cannabis product in order to treat a mental health condition so the most frequently prescribed psychiatric condition is anxiety generalized anxiety disorder we're also seeing a few approvals come through for uh post-traumatic stress disorder and there's been a lot of talk around that especially in the veteran community in north america that's a big conversation and over here as well um and and a small number of approvals for uh depression so most of those psychiatric approvals are for anxiety followed by post traumatic stress disorder and then a few for depression yeah gotcha and i think one thing you know i think you've raised a really interesting point there that that perception that cannabis causes these um these conditions where and one of the and i will talk a little bit about it later but one of the things is we have to look at which type of cannabis medicine it is is it cbd or thc um and and doctors who do know about cannabis medicine are learning more and more about this and able to help people and help their patients understand if cannabis is right for them um i think this is also a good point to insert the fact that neither of us are doctors and so none of this is medical advice um we are you know just explaining what what we know about cannabis um and what the data shows and some of the things that are happening so if you do feel that cannabis is for you definitely talk to your gp or another healthcare specialist and they'll be able to help you um but on that topic so you know we're talking a lot about some of these very serious medical conditions um and people do and as you mentioned overseas people are getting cannabis cbd oil particularly for a lot less serious conditions so it may be minor anxiety or even just health and wellness purposes um and it's so what i guess where i'm going with this is that the department of health is currently doing a review on the potential down scheduling of low-dose cbd from a schedule four to a schedule three drug i know that this means that it may be over-the-counter or over-the-counter through a pharmacist by 2021 but maybe you can give people a little bit more information about what that looks like yeah so at the moment cannabis medicines are prescription only medicines uh and you know so they're only available on prescription by a medical doctor what's being looked at at the moment and what the department of health has recommended should happen is that low-dose cbd so just cbd by itself and only in doses of up to about 60 milligrams a day which is a very low dose um that products like that are appropriate to be made available behind the counter at pharmacies so the intention from the department of health is to create an environment where you know someone can go into their pharmacy and speak with a pharmacist and say oh hey you know i've got a jet lag or i've got um temporary sleep disturbance or a temporary anxiety of some kind you know do you have anything might help me out and the pharmacist might recommend or advise them to consider a cbd product and dispense that to them yeah absolutely and i think i think one important thing to mention though reese is that it's you know while we will have an industry that is highly regulated and very different there are benefits to that and you know having making sure that there is good quality and that is safe for people you look at america became the wild west for cbd oil and people were getting sick and um you know so so there is definitely some benefit to to having that having those types of regulations i think it's important to um clarify that not all cannabis or medicinal cannabis can get you high so there are many compounds in the cannabis plant and there are two main chemicals that people think of when they think of cannabis so that's cbd and thc and they're called cannabinoids so before we um explain this again just important to say that we're not doctors so we we're not giving you medical advice um but reese maybe you can explain cbd a little bit and then i'll jump in to explain thc so uh thc and cbd are the most uh common cannabinoids that these plants produce they actually produce a whole range of chemicals you know 100 200 depending on who you ask or how how uh how detailed you want to look at things but the the cannabinoid that's produced the most in these plants is thc and that has you know many potential therapeutic effects it also has an intoxicating effect um so you know that's the high that that people get when they consume cannabis for recreational purposes cbd has has quite a few overlapping therapeutic um potential with thc so it's not as if you know thc treats this and cbd treats that and they're very different drugs it's actually quite a lot of overlap um but the the interesting thing or one of the interesting things about cbd is it doesn't cause an intoxicating effect so depending on which product you end up accessing or which product you get prescribed you will or will not have the risk of being intoxicated but i should say that you know even if you are prescribed a product that contains some amount of thc usually you you will at least initially anyway be prescribed at a really low dose a dose that won't uh contribute to an intoxicating effect yeah that's a really good point recent i think you know something important to note is that in australia technically it is illegal to drive with any thc in your system and that's something that's a big topic um for discussion which maybe we can do at another time um but you know any thc in your system if they do find it in a roadside test which is a saliva test would technically be illegal um but it doesn't mean you are impaired and that's that's one of the big challenges with the legality around medical cannabis in australia with that being said let's talk a little bit about the current state of cannabis products in australia so can you tell us a little bit about the what what kind of cannabis products there are maybe we'll start there what kind of cannabis products are available in australia there are a pretty wide variety of cannabis products medical cannabis products that are available in australia and most of the time if you get prescribed a cannabis product you know if you didn't know it was a cannabis product and if it didn't have you know medicinal cannabis or you know written on the label you pro you wouldn't know that it's that it's cannabis we we are in a really um interesting position at the moment australia because we have probably 130 different products that are available to be prescribed and that those products come in a variety of formulations concentrations and delivery formats so you know you know you could have products that are very strong or very potent products that are lower dose or weaker products with only cbd only thc or you know any number of various combinations of thc and cbd and these products could come in a flower form that does look like what we think of as recreational cannabis although that's not very common but these products can also come in an oral oil which is in a bottle with a dropper and you ingest the oil you know mouth sprays capsules pills topical applications gels you know there's a lot of product diversity in the australian market at the moment and that's good because it allows um patients to or allows doctors to prescribe products that are the most appropriate for particular patients absolutely and and one question we do here often is are there cbd only flowers or thc only flowers and the answer to that is yes there is a really broad range of which products are available your doctor will end up being the one who chooses the product that's right for you just like any other medication you can't walk into your doctor and say hey i want flour and they go yes no problem it doesn't work that way um so you know and that's something we might see with changes in legalization eventually um but that's nowhere near what's happening now so yeah so the other thing then reese we've talked about there being a wide range of products and everything can you talk a little bit about what is the maybe most prescribed type of product or uh you know just give us a little bit more detail about product and product selection the most common product to be prescribed in australia isn't is an oral oil that contains no thc so a pure cbd oil that's the most common product um to be prescribed in australia followed by a product that contains mostly cbd um and some thc or you know roughly one-to-one balance of cbd and thc so um you know basically in australia it's not very common to be prescribed a product that only contains thc most of the time it'll be a combination or just cbd by itself yeah great and and i think the other thing about australian products which maybe we can talk a little bit about and i'll i'll say something and maybe you can add to it but there are actually very few products that are australian grown and manufactured and i i believe as of today there are actually only three companies doing that there's kendeo there's one on torah product um and then there's little green pharma who produces australian grown and manufactured products maybe you can give us just a really short overview of what that ecosystem looks like and then we'll jump into product cost yeah i think you can probably add australian natural therapeutics group to that list as well but you're right it's a very small list yeah um so 90 95 of products available in australia are either imported or their ingredients are imported and they're manufactured locally you know one of the reasons why we have such a limited range of australian cultivated products has been we have a very rigorous and time-consuming regulatory framework around who gets to cultivate medical cannabis in australia and how they're meant to be doing it so that's been a long-term project for many companies to get themselves off the ground but we're now starting to see more australian cultivated products come to market which is great the benefit of australian cultivated products is first of all you know you can be guaranteed about their quality standards because we have the most rigorous quality standards for cannabis cultivation in the world in australia um and you can hopefully they will also be lower cost because at the moment most of our products are coming from overseas from places like canada and some countries within europe and they need to be cultivated by someone you know extracted by someone manufactured by someone exported by someone imported by someone wholesale by someone retails by you know so by the time the supply chain comes to its um its conclusion um you know prices have have uh have been inflated um so we're hoping that you know shortening that supply chain and having australian-made products available will help with affordability yeah great and something you touched on in terms of quality is i think something we'll definitely talk about again in the future there you know most people don't know that australian grown and manufactured products are held to a higher standard than other products or flour that's been imported so a discussion for another day but i think a very interesting one so can you talk to us a little bit about patient cost and spend and where that's been because you know there's a perception that it's just unachievable for everyone which isn't really true um but yeah if you give us some context on that it would be great when we talk about product pricing uh generally the way that we that freshly likes to talk about product pricing is in price per milligram of cannabinoid you know so let's reduce everything down to this unit that we can measure milligram per cannabinoid pricing has has gotten better so product prices continue to decrease on average every month um from september last year to march this year on average we saw about a 20 reduction in product pricing from march this year to september this year we will see i expect we will see a greater than 20 reduction in average product pricing i'm yet to crunch the numbers on that but that's what we expect so prices are coming down so that's on the price side of things but you know how much it will cost me as a patient to use a medical cannabis product will be determined by which product i'm prescribed how much that product costs and how much medication i need to take on a daily basis to treat my particular medical condition everybody is different everybody requires a different amount of medication to treat their specific situation so some patients will be lucky enough to only need to spend you know 50 or 100 a month on their prescribed medical cannabis product because they only need a small amount other patients are unfortunate to have medical conditions that require very very high doses of medical cannabis and they could be spending many hundreds or thousands of dollars a month depending on on the severity of their condition so on average when it comes to the patients that that we have information on at the moment patients pay between about 350 and 450 per month on their prescribed cannabis medicine so that's quite a lot of money um but it is within you know it is within the realms of possibility for some people um that's the average though so there'll be people who'd be probably spending less than that and people will be spending a lot more than that okay great and and i think that's really good context for people i think the advice there is if you do think medical cannabis is for you you know don't just turn it away because you've heard that it's expensive right think about you know do some research talk to your doctor and and find out you know roughly what it may cost you for your condition now it's safe to assume that over the next six to 12 months the cannabis market in australia is definitely going to change particularly with access and we'll talk a little bit about what those things are um i don't think we're going to see any sort of major cannabis reform or legalization but you know one interesting fact is that there was a survey from 2019 from roy morgan that showed that 42 of australians support legalization and that's not decriminalization that's legalization now another 49 don't but it's it's it's gone up quite uh quite drastically over the past few years so reese let's cover off a few things that have happened in the past six months or that are happening throughout the rest of 2020 so um one thing to mention and this is more grassroots and i think this is important to mention is that in late june a group of cannabis advocates led by a woman named deb lynch the founder of medical cannabis users australia she started the legalized cannabis queensland party now they gathered over 600 members in just 10 days to help get the party up and running and they were successful and are now waiting to hear if they'll be registered a registered party in time for the october of queensland vote uh queensland election so i think you know these little things are really important for the cannabis industry overall it's it's a new voice for cannabis it's a new voice for uh making cannabis safe but more accessible um and and it's these little things that will will really have an impact as well one other thing to mention is and reese we might get a little bit of information from you on this but um fiona patton has pushed through the first victorian cannabis inquiry which is now open to public submission that will close in august but the goal of this submission is to learn what victorians think about cannabis perhaps you can tell us just a little bit more about what that means and what they're looking for i mean i'm i'm not super familiar with fiona patton's scope of work but my understanding is that they are canvassing for opinions on how people think and feel about drug use in general you know including cannabis and the eye is very much on you know is there a way in which we could regulate cannabis better than how it's currently being regulated through prohibition so you know prohibition is regulation it's a regulatory framework that causes particular outcomes let's take a look at what prohibition does how it's working how it's been working and you know is there is there a better way i think that's that's generally the thrust of the inquiry it'll be interesting to see what comes out of that only because victoria is a very progressive state it was also the first state to attempt to legalize medical cannabis um back in 2015 i think it was so victoria was going to go ahead and legalize medical cannabis without the federal government or any other states or territories coming on board they were ready to pull the trigger on that and then the federal government stepped in and said well you know let's do this as a federation so they have demonstrated in the past that they are prepared to move on drug policy issues um you know without federal leadership so i think if we do see some movement in this space it's likely to come from victoria um the other thing to mention now is the upcoming election in new zealand um and there is a referendum on cannabis so maybe you can talk a little bit about that for us yeah so in september um the news that the kiwis will be voting for their new government and they'll also be voting on two referendums one about voluntary assisted uh dying or euthanasia and one about recreational cannabis legalization so what's really great about the new zealand approach is that they have already put together quite a detailed and well thought out uh policy framework so the regulations about you know what would a recreational cannabis framework look like in new zealand that's already been decided um you know by and large so people are going into this vote with their eyes open you know they're not they're not choosing between two hypotheticals that they're choosing they have the option of voting in favor of quite a well fleshed out uh and and appropriate uh regulatory proposal yeah awesome and i mean we talk about that you know the the potential down scheduling of cbd um you know we've got a lot of really interesting things coming up so do you have any other maybe predictions or anything else you'd like to say about what you think could happen in the next six to twelve months ah um i have no idea that's one of the great things about cannabis though is you know it's funny when people have been in the industry we talk about cannabis years like dog years like one year in the cannabis industry is seven years uh in real life because there's always so much going on and so many things coming up and um and you know speed bumps or or slides you know snakes and ladders um so the future is pretty unpredictable i'm looking forward to the new zealand vote i'm looking forward to the cbd down scheduling conversation being progressed because that's still at its early stages at the moment we don't even know if it's going to happen yet but a final decision on cbd logo cbd down scheduling will come out in november so that'll be a big milestone for the industry i think great so um before we wrap up we'll just remind you of what's coming so we will be doing this um this month in cannabis series every month on the third week we'll launch it on the third week of every month and that'll be available for you on all the social channels um through both honole freshleaf and any other any other partners who want to join in sharing that with you we are talking to the australian cannabis community right and that doesn't mean just medicinal patients that means everyone um and we want people to get involved and we want to hear from you so um if you're interested in medicinal cannabis if you are interested in adult use cannabis we'd love for you to join us to here uh to ask us questions to submit questions and you can submit your questions or thoughts to at honolee.com dot a u slash contact um and you can follow honolee at honolulu.com.edu or on our social channels we are honely a you um reese do you want to tell people where they can follow you or um you know fresh leaf most certainly so you can find me on the fresh leaf website which is fresh leaf analytics dot com dot a u and i i put up regular blog posts um on that website you can also catch me on linkedin where my name is r-h-y-s-c-o-h-e-n and you can find me on twitter at reese cullen awesome thanks rhys so um yeah if we look forward to sharing more information about cannabis with everyone and we look forward to hearing from you thanks for joining us

8YYlhd2Avos,.Lior Harel | Australia &amp; Medicinal Cannabis,2020-10-27T04:05:09Z,[Music] so tell me more about the medicinal cannabis space in australia sure medicinal cannabis was legalized by the federal government in late 2016 so what the federal government did is they instituted a framework for companies or individuals to be licensed and to cultivate manufacture or research medicinal cannabis that framework is is really quite comprehensive there's a licensing regime and a permitting regime and there are a number of state and regulatory bodies that need to work together in order to get medicinal cannabis products from the manufacturers to the patients so you know it's only been legal in australia for a relatively short period of time i think there are approximately 6000 patients who are accessing medicinal cannabis products legally which is a pretty small amount and obviously you know we're hoping that as the industry progresses more patients can avail themselves of the product i think it's just probably worth making one point about medicinal cannabis there are lots of misconceptions out there in the market and i think that the biggest misconception is that every single cannabis strain gets you stoned or gets you high that's not actually the case um this strain of cannabis that has that effect thc can be removed um from the plant so many patients are accessing um low thc products and you know they don't have any sort of stoned or high effects at all and that's why we see a lot of young people and also elderly people having great success with these products tell us where is australia compared to the rest of the world in relation to this space it's a good question i think there's a perception that australia is quite progressive when it comes to medicinal cannabis and in relation to other countries um that have legalized um its use uh we're pretty far behind um you know the leading countries for medicinal cannabis usage canada and the united states um israel has made a lot of progress um and also some countries in in south america so as i said before there's a really small number of patients that have accessed medicinal cannabis locally the costs are prohibitive the bureaucracy is complicated and as an industry what we're trying to do is is to make that process easier and the intersection between consumption of the product and the law is really interesting and and the law really hasn't caught up so what we're seeing is that people are being arrested for obtaining cannabis products to give to their sick children or their elderly parents and there's a view that that's just not right but the law hasn't yet caught up to that so so hopefully we'll see some change on that front how far away do you think that will look there's there's a big push by patient advocates and also by industry groups and chronos australia is part of the the broader industry group to make cannabis medicinal cannabis more affordable and to streamline legislation uh and processes to actually enable patients to alleviate their suffering and that's what we're all about i mean medicinal cannabis it's not a cure all it's not a fix-all but it's been shown to help with pain with illness with nausea with with lots of cancer related suffering unfortunately and i'm hoping within the next two or three years we see a streamlining of the processes so that more patients can access

HawDSFFYmFo,Medicinal cannabis,2020-03-01T22:47:33Z,"[Music] so I don't personally use it but I do know of one person that does use it and she prefers it over opioids and she sort of just smokes a joint it's not medicinal and so I decided to try cannabis for pain relief it's like it just switches off I did discuss it with my doctor and she was very onboard with me using it for pain relief but also to help me sleep and used it as a way to reduce the pharmaceutical pain relief that I was taking and found wonderful results my psychologist she was very supportive of the use of the cannabis as she believed as it's definitely more effective than opiates and definitely better on the body I found the only part I don't like about the cannabis isn't also the psychoactive effect that it has I work full-time I only do it at home I only do it when all the children are asleep and my husband's here so I believe it's the most effective pain relief at this stage medical medical cannabis I have a permit for around a year and a half it's not so easy to get one so I was lucky and it actually took a while for me to find the right strain and the right amount it was really just take maybe two puffs yesterday took one and it was enough for like an hour I trust this substance I know it's clean I know there's nothing crazy in it I know some at least like twenty thirty forty girls with and though that gets cannabis so it saved their legs like itch they couldn't function before before the cannabis so having lived with a partner for 14 years with stage-four endometriosis I have an acute awareness of the pain and suffering this dreadful condition can inflict upon women so I'm also cognizant of the terrible mental cost it can cause and the often overlooked impact upon quality of life the current medical management of endometriosis focuses largely on hormone therapy opiate medication NSAIDs and surgery to resect the diseased tissue now such strategies are very effective in many instances first most women with milder presentations of the disease but for those with severe cases like my partner it was poorly managed so it's poorly managing in many instances for women with stage for their chronic pain and poses several risks when it comes to drug side effects particularly addiction addiction to opiates my partner had five laparoscopy and finally a partial hysterectomy last year and I'm saddened to report that she is still not without significant symptoms the AMA has stated that Australia has a major problem with addiction to prescription medications highlighting the opioid class is a major contributing factor recent research is so and shown that medicinal cannabis grow into incredibly high quality standards may not only be able to help people with chronic pain but reduces the reliance on the opiate drug class for pain relief I've met several women particularly in the United States who are managing their pain from endometriosis with medicinal cannabis prescribed by a licensed doctor and in most cases they were able to significantly reduce the use of some of their prescription medications and have improved quality of life I've also met several here at home doing the same albeit not under the care of a medical professional obviously such case study evidence is not a row not robust it's not a clinical trial but it should at least provide the medical logic that many that may guide clinicians to consider the current evidence of cannabis and chronic pain and hopefully assist in establishing more rigorous studies on medicinal cannabis and endometriosis in the future whilst not a panacea I strongly believe that medicinal cannabis can provide another useful tool in the medical armamentarium that is safer in some instances with less side effects than certain drug classes and hope that cannabis would be a first line option and not an option of last resort as it currently is with the TGA and I hope to show this through to you through the evidence as I take us through so this is just a list of my disclosure for transparency so please note that I'm not paid nor have received payment from any medicinal cannabis cultivators either here in Australia or internationally also in all the lectures that I've provided in the last three years to academics health professionals patients or industry I've not received payment or receive funding whatsoever and will always work in this space pro bono and if you're wondering what a Pharma cogno cyst is because that's my background we study drugs that come from plants so let's first start out by having a look at what the literature says about the endometriosis and the little-known endocannabinoid system so I'll not go into details about endo and pain in my talk because there are far more qualified experts such as Susan and Meredith to take us down that path but what I would like to talk about is how pain is modulated via the endocannabinoid system in this landmark paper by boses and colleagues published earlier this year a review of the significance of endocannabinoids in endometriosis pain management was investigated now for those of you who don't know endocannabinoids are produced within the body I want you to think of them as kind of like your own naturally-occurring cannabis compounds you might have even experienced these when you've gone on a run or worked out the runner's high so often associated with endorphins has actually been also linked to an and amide which was the first key endocannabinoid isolated in research these endocannabinoids then interact with cannabinoid receptors within the brain and other tissues so here's a quick breakdown of the endocannabinoid system we'd know nothing about this entire neuromodulatory system if it was not for research into the cannabis plant and whilst it's too big a topic to obviously cover in 20 minutes suffice it to say that it's an integral part of how the body regulates and maintains homeostasis and has serious implications for how we perceive and manage pain now essentially the endocannabinoid system is comprised of three major components number one that cannabinoid receptors the cb1 and c two receptors which are distributed throughout the various organs and tissues number two we've got the endogenous ligands the endocannabinoids which basically interact with those receptors and there you can see up on the slide and a racket and oil ethanol a mean or an and amide and to a record an oil glycerol which are our two main endogenous ligands so the best way to think about this is when you think of the receptors think of a lock when you think of the endogenous ligands think of the key when the two come together this can elicit a physiological response and then lastly we've got the enzymes that actually manufacture or break down those endogenous ligands so that they're made on demand and being able to be removed as needed so another interesting compound is called permit oil ethanolamine which we shortened just for today to peña now whilst not a classic endocannabinoid because it doesn't bind to the cb1 and cb2 receptors it does bind the receptors that are the same class and described as cannabinoid like g-protein coupled receptors and also been shown to potentiate endocannabinoid actions like an and ermine so i want you to keep our p EA in the back of your mind for now as I'll be showing you some interesting research about this very soon now in this review still on the boozes paper the researchers highlight there are three main types of pain those being nos acepted inflammatory and neuropathic now wherever you see on this slide the term ECS this is where the endocannabinoid system interacts with the various mechanisms that contribute to pain therefore showing a potential target for pain amelioration or modulation so key to this discussion is the role of nerves and inflammation with many researchers considering of course endometriosis to be a chronic inflammatory can bore Xia's posits that the inflammatory mediators establish an environment for hypersensitivity to inflammatory stimuli furthermore the central nervous system plays a key role in the experience of pain particularly in chronic pelvic pain patients and endocannabinoids may play a significant role in reducing pain signaling particularly in the region known as the substantial gelatinous ax in the spinal cord now neuropathic pain is one of the more difficult types pain to treat and manage pharmaceutically and therefore focusing on the EECS and its regulatory mechanisms within the central nervous system is a very novel target utilizing endocannabinoids plant-based cannabinoids those that come from the cannabis plant and other plants or synthetically derived cannabinoids that have been manufactured in a lab so remember that peña that I talked about palmitoyl ethanol am i it so that endogenous compound here we have some studies that have actually looked at its use in primary dysmenorrhea and endometriosis now Tartaglia noted that 400 milligrams of PE a with poly Deyton which is a precursor for resveratrol antioxidant compound so improvement of pelvic pain in 98% of patients whereas the study by Caruso on endometriosis also on B ei but this time using lipoic acid or alpha lipoic acid noted improvement in quality of life sexual health and progressive reduction in the pain syndrome lastly preliminary results released by la montee and colleagues found that PE a at 400 milligrams with poly danton showed statistically significant improvement in pelvic pain dysmenorrhea dyspareunia as well as improvement in quality of life and decreased use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories a weakness of the study however is that it was only on 24 women but the results are certainly encouraging now this posits whether endometriosis could be the result of an endocannabinoid deficiency of which more research certainly needs to take place but which may explain why many women are finding relief of the many symptoms of endometriosis by utilizing cannabis so that begs the question then what exactly is medicinal cannabis and how is it different to recreational cannabis so we'll have a look at that right now so there's no special species or strain or type that separates medicinal cannabis from recreational cannabis except that the latter is usually bred to have very high levels of tetrahydrocannabinol or delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol commonly known as THC which is the main psychoactive compound which uses chase to get high and it doesn't have much else so it's grown sometimes hydroponically in poor conditions and in many instances has you use pesticides and fungicides fungicide sorry that may be harmful to ingest so the first point is that what makes medicinal cannabis unique is it's grown to incredibly high quality standards and is tested for things such as heavy metals aflatoxins microbial contamination and pesticide and fungicide residues secondly medicinal cannabis has grown to such standards that the amounts of medicinal components so things like THC CBD CBG CBN which ever they are can be very tightly regulated giving measured and reproducible results every time so something that physicians of course would surely want to give to their patients so that you can get that same reproducible result so this is definitely a requirement and not something that you'll be able to ascertain from the black market as they do not test for any of these things so as you can see the dried unfertilized female inflorescence or little flowers is used medicinally and much like Catholic school we keep the boys from the girls to ensure that the flowers from the females are full of cannabinoids and terpenoids from reproduction which would reduce their potency so the cannabinoids and the terpenes are the main chemicals within the plant that have medicinal benefit and they're stored in these tiny little hairs or glands called tri cones which are all over the flower now interestingly cannabis has been used by our ancestors for millennia to assist with pain management with analgesic properties being reported in the written histories of cultures of China India Persian Persia Sumeria and also the Roman Empire our earliest recorded history is in 2700 years before Christ where it was utilized for and wait for it rheumatic pain intestinal constipation and disorders of the female reproductive system now here's an example of two of the most research cannabinoids and where things get interesting is that plant cannabinoids bind to the same type of receptors that our endocannabinoids do now THC there up on the Left binds with relatively high affinity to our cb1 and cb2 receptors in the central nervous system very similar to that of our own endogenously manufactured and and amide which is why it's so useful for pain so this constituent is associated with the feeling of psycho activity and if given in high isolated doses can cause dysphoria and potential paranoia and anxiety in certain individuals now pharmacologically THC is a well described analgesic in the management of pain related to cancer muscle spasm migraine phantom limb pain spinal cord injury damaged nerves and even post surgery surgery pain CBD on the other hand or cannabidiol is classified as a non-psychoactive cannabinoid and doesn't produce the same high CBD actually opposes the dysphoric effects of THC which is why it's a benefit to ensure the two constituents are present in varying amounts or ratios in depending on the therapeutic condition that's being treated unlike THC CBD has very little affinity for the binding to cb1 and cb2 receptors but rather works via different mechanisms of action such as being an agonist for serotonin at the 5-htt 1a receptor which may explain why it exhibits antidepressant and anxiety activity so as you can see CBD also has other significant actions those being antioxidant anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective but this is just 2 cannabinoids out of a total of a hundred and forty-four that have been characterized from this genus but regrettably I don't have time to go through all of them today or unsure you're all breathing a sigh of relief so cannabis and pain what does the evidence say so what we're going to do is just have a quick look because this is something that I constantly come up with in the talks is that there's not enough evidence so I'm going to give you a snapshot of what currently is available now I'm sure many of you will be interested to hear with this paper by light that suggested that the top reported condition in Colorado where it's both legal medicinally and for recreation is for severe and chronic pain coming in at over 94% so 94% of medical users choose to use it for this further supported by organ and colleagues who in 2013 reported that over 87 percent of participants in their study were seeking medical cannabis for pain also now not surprisingly there's a variety of evidentiary outcomes based on the rigor of the scientific studies and their designs but here in the Journal of pain management published in 2016 it was interesting to note that nabek simal oral mucosal sprays so such as sativex which you can already access here in Australia resulted in pain reduction but with variable clinical significance so however studies of smoked or vaporized cannabis consistently demonstrated statistically significant and clinically relevant reductions in neuropathic pain smoked or vaporize forms plus past the blood-brain barrier very quickly often within one to two minutes and have a very fast onset of action which is quite different to ingested doses when you take that internally which can take between 45 to 90 minutes to actually work as they need to pass through the metabolism of the liver the good thing about that though is that they're often more potent and have a longer lasting effect it's been many documented cases in Colorado and California of grandmother's that picked up brownies that were medicated and ended up seeing purple dinosaurs so it's it's definitely something you need to be concerned about alright so in this retrospective analysis that which was conducted by Fanelli in Italy colleagues earlier this year it was looking at intractable chronic pain now it was shown that cannabis tea was a primary delivery method with 76 percent of patients continued treatment and 15 percent dropped out due to side effects but these side effects were not described as severe almost all of these patients were also on other pharmaceutical drugs and pain treatment so researchers determined that cannabis was an effective and safe treatment but recognized that there are more trials needed and it's not all about THC of course because CBD also possesses local analgesic neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory actions which may significantly impact on chronic pain sufferers what was interesting about this gelila study of 2015 which was conducted on mice was that it was highly standardized botanically derived so grown from plant not isolated and here it refers to it as clone - OH - and that clone 202 performed better than isolated CBD alone so administered both in peritoneal and orally not only did it demonstrate a clear correlation between anti-inflammatory and pain relieving activity but that it demonstrated increasing responses with increasing dose and now let's actually have a look at the review of evidence particularly in humans so in this review by Hiland 2015 it was shown that the use of cannabis for chronic pain neuropathic pain and spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis is supported by high-level evidence in this review a total of 79 clinical trials inclusive of six thousand four hundred and sixty-two participants were included compared with placebo cannabinoids were associated with a greater a verge number of patients showing reduction in pain and greater average reduction in numerical pain rating scales suggested that there was moderate activity or moderate quality evidence for the use of cannabis and cannabinoids with chronic pain but this year in early 2017 the National Academies of Sciences engineering and medicine released this comprehensive review which you can download for free as a PDF entitled the health effects of cannabis and cannabinoids the current state of evidence and recommendations for research here's a summary of their findings which is as you will see shows conclusive and substantial evidence for the treatment of chronic pain in adults the evidence is now incontrovertible that cannabis can relieve chronic pain but this does not mean it's not without risk and will work for everyone as everybody's endocannabinoid system is slightly different in the one-size-fits-all model will likely not optimize patient outcomes and this should excite a lot of clinicians dealing with chronic pain bark uber and colleagues published a paper in the journal of the American Medical Association internal medicine in 2014 which is clearly demonstrated that state medicinal cannabis laws in the USA are associated with significantly lower level opioid overdose mortality rates which lowered in year one by 20% and strengthened to 33% after six years with an average of about twenty four point eight the CDC in the USA posted that in 2010 over 16,000 people died from pharmaceutical opioid analgesics and what does Australian statistics say this is what you can see here lots of people that are suffering with this and the concern I have there is that they are just Victorian statistics and this paper in by Lukas in harm-reduction Journal released just last month also confirms what's known as the substitution effect and suggest that there's a growing body of evidence to support the use of cannabis as an adjunct or substitute for opioids particularly when you consider that the Australian Medical Association has declared this a major public health focus both in both in 2015 and 2017 and furthermore and perhaps more interestingly is the huge cost savings to the public healthcare system in this study by Bradford and Bradford in 2016 it was shown that between 2010 and 2013 US states with medicinal use of cannabis were shown to have a 12% lower rate of pain relief prescriptions in the US Medicaid patients and eight to 13 percent lower rates of prescriptions for anxiety depression psychosis nausea and sleep disorders so national overall reductions in the Medicare program when states implemented medicinal cannabis laws were estimated to be approximately a hundred and sixty-five million dollars u.s. so in finishing up I just wanted to touch on some of our directions for research particularly well not just with cannabis but in general at nickim so this strapping young man that we can see right here is my colleague dr. Mike Armour so a postdoctoral research fellow within nickim who's got a wealth of experience working in the area of endometriosis and women's health Mike and the team have noted that women with period pain not related to endo commonly use self-care to manage pain and that women with endo often need to become their own health care expert as I'm sure many of you are learning as they go about what helps you individually now others speaking today will highlight and already have how dietary change in other self-care such as meditation and yoga show promise in managing symptoms associated with endo and as we saw at the start of the presentation many women are also using things like cannabis and so we're hoping that our online survey for this project where we're going to look at associated symptoms planning on looking at what self-care you do how how you go about it what how you find it works and how much it costs so that we can share that information with others and also try and guide future research so we're hoping that that online survey for the project will be ready in about six to eight weeks and we'll be promoting this through wonderful organizations like endow active and other support groups so please keep an eye out for that so I look forward to listening to the rest of today's wonderful presenters thank you once again for the invitation and hope that you research and if the cannabis genus will provide a useful tool tool from the medical practitioners to assist women are suffering from endo and pelvic pain in the not-too-distant future thank you for your kind attention"
FOHR31O6zdA,CA Clinics   Medical Cannabis Patients,2020-02-14T06:27:48Z,yeah the guys at work on those they come a junkies never subtract in life they don't say oh we gonna bet cannabis tonight everything old smoke it's not like that it's just an oil you know I take the dope to coke so yeah that's it I'm Darrin couch I'm 58 years old three years ago I couldn't even I couldn't even walk [ __ ] drive a car I said go out the car of the crying plane laying bricks on my life once my hand I couldn't even push myself up off the couch I've been taking the cannabis oil for about three months now we start off with a little point five and in devotee way up and the first week I did notice an absolute change in my body this this little bottle here cost me four hundred and twenty dollars and it's probably last me between seven to eight days I take a mill twice a day in the morning tonight and it's a miracle [Music]
XrCzUgeezNQ,How legislation around cannabis products and CBD is changing in Australia - Dr Ben,2020-01-25T00:38:36Z,after the federal government bought in the the changes to how cannabis was viewed then the states brought in their regulation to control the process from a state point of view that resulted in a lot of legislation and not a lot of fun reading on our behalf I have to say that has progressively changed and the states have retracted most of their updated legislation and changed their regulations of their health acts so it is becoming progressively easier and more accessible with them Queensland now there is very little extra legislation that's required or in place for medicinal cannabis cannabis is now considered a medicine if you looked in in South Wales even more so and we really just have to get our heads around the fact that medicinal cannabis was amidst it up until prohibition and now it's back there thinking about it had been some sort of illicit or really dangerous substance is not not true anymore it's back to where it was prior to 1930 back to being a medicine
KcwF4yzpVDg,APSAD Webinar 1: Medical Cannabis and the Addictions,2020-06-18T00:47:32Z,"good afternoon everybody and welcome to the first apps ed and webinar series for 2019 is the moment to be invited to talk about such as medical cannabis now I see many we already have a bit of an understanding around making canvas issues so I'm not going to spend a lot of time going over the well I will touch up on some issues where medical cannabis regulatory frameworks and just what we mean by medical cannabis with a view then too before I really get into what warning folks know about is how this impacts upon us in the drug and alcohol addiction sector and you'll see my organizational affiliation is there on the slide alright so look I just went in this talk doesn't want to acknowledge the immense contribution David also to this whole area of medical cannabis and the addictions David was the first one that really got any of us interested in medical cannabis or cannabis I used to sort of treatment some of you may know that David has been quite unwell recently and has actually pulled out of work and I think many of us would wish him well you can see there my some of my conference of interest with gas room funding received very little funding in there from governments or NHMRC for medical cannabis research I don't think anything everything what that I'm referring to is this is closed where the that comes from so in terms of their plantation I would provide a quick overview Michael Candice in Australia or where the pharmacology victory models and what kinds of products are currently available and then we'll spend some time looking at the issue around about cannabis use disorder developing in patients who are using medical cannabis and what this means for us as a treatment sector so a lot of think of that it's a little bit like if we're thinking about patients using opioids in chronic pain treatment some of those patients a minority of them will become a feeling dependent so because similarly she's going on with medical cannabis that many of the conditions are long-term hunting conditions portion of patients may go end up using cannabis long-term and the portion of those Linda having a cannabis use disorders I'm just going to explore what some of those issues are crossing addiction medicine and they want to finish up actually looking at how we may think about harnessing the cannabinoids and medical cannabis in the treatment of substance use disorders we look tokus on cannabis and opioids listen oh if you what I might do is just pause at the end of each of these three sections throw it open up for any quick kind of questions and then move on to the next section so quick overview medical cannabis I'm going to whiz through these slides simply because I hope many of you sort of seen our other seen them before I've seen something similar before or she'll be turning familiar with many of the issues around us so for those of you kept the cannabinoids work because we have a endocannabinoid system there are seedling 1 receptors Clem boyd 1 receptors and cb2 receptors are the ones that we know of at the moment I see big one is largely brain gut and respiratory CB 2 tends to be more immune system we our bodies also produce endogenous cannabinoids so we've got cannabinoid receptors we then manufacture our own cannabinoids and amide - AJ you the most well own the endogenous cannabinoids is a whole range of enzymes are dag mango and so forth these are cellular enzymes that metabolize the endogenous cannabinoids so in terms of the future research directions there are some research groups are actually arguing those enzymes so think of SSRIs you want to increase serotonin levels and you do that by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin or there's some similar kinds of research approaches going on with the cannabinoids you know can you change the cannabinoid system by by influencing the metabolism of the endogenous cannabinoids of course another way of impacting upon the cannabinoid system is by using exogenous cannabinoids and there's two sources of exogenous cannabinoids either plant-based or synthetic THC is the base the best known before the cannabinoids THC itself is a partial agonist at the cb1 receptor system mostly been one receptor system as most of those psychoactive effects that one would be to me with their cameras producers know THC can be derived from a plant it can be made synthetically cannabinoids are not difficult molecules to make synthetically indeed they're incredibly much cheaper to make synthetically than to try to extract them away and as we know THC produces a range of psycho activities or effects working in the addiction sector I think most of us be well aware of what the effects of THC are sedation euphoria cognitive forms effects some impact upon memory reaction time and so forth and there's a range of physiological effects as well and noting that it can also have some antiemetic analgesic effects and so forth the pharmacology in terms the kinetics has poor bioavailability when taken orally it's not great even when it's inhaled you'll see the graphs there on the right-hand side the top graph is what happens when you smoke cannabis and the bottom one is what happens when you consume it orally so if you take it orally it has slightly lower bioavailability because the first pass metabolism but what you see is much longer duration of effects so takes longer to reach T max so it takes about an hour or so for oral effects and lasting up to about four four hours can contrast that with we vaporize in the smoking where it's a much more rapid on but also the situation that duration of action THC is metabolized through the liver it's a number of sip drugs although the drug drug interactions with THC don't appear that clinically relevant as soon as I say that I'm sure someone's going to point out that they once saw a clinically relevant interaction which HC but it's not a key key feature clinically THC itself is metabolized very quickly 211 hydroxy THC which is also active and you'll see that in the grass on the right then the main metabolite is carboxy THC that is inactive so that actually doesn't produce any psychoactive effects and it is largely carboxy THC that we detect in the urine now if you're only using a key so forth sporadic cannabis use capacitation is detectable for a few days if you are a regular user of cannabis with Connie Keith and Betsy carboxy THC will will stay in effect on the urine for weeks at least at least one month and go to as long as two to three months those THC that's sort of the main cannabinoid of interest especially addiction their area but because I like an appetizer a whole range of cannabinoid molecules in the cannabis plant the other one which is a particular interest clinically is kind of dial CBD cannabidiol is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid it has a range of properties that are very interesting clinically and convulsant anxiolytic antipsychotic effects so my good animal data area and you're a protective effect and some analgesic effects as well you can see the dope this CBD that they were using it clinically a lot of variation but you can see it's usually in that 200 to 1200 with most conditions using around 400 to 800 milligrams oral CBD a day in Australia CBDs a schedule for drug although there is no licensed product or CBD part licensed in Australia yet the first CBD product has been licensed in the u.s. recently the FDA have approved at the dynamics the picture like better directs down the bottom that's the GW manufactured medication and it's been approved for video together let seen on responding to first-time treatment the main interest areas for CBD or epilepsy mental health neurodegenerative conditions and low interest in the addiction space and we'll come back to the pharmacologist CBD that's a really busy slide I'm gonna walk through most of it other than to say this phone call you seem a little bit complicated in that we don't really know how CBD works and as you know when you don't know what a mechanism of action is it's really hard to understand the kinetics of a fairly straightforward it has poor bar availability again only five to ten percent oral bioavailability and the issue there again is first-pass metabolism now CBD unlike THC actually does appear to have a range of clinically relevant drug drug interactions you can see the most commonly sort of identified sip drugs and CBDs are potent inhibitor of SIP enzymes so what that means is that other inhibitors will will slow down the metabolism of CBD and CBD will slow down the metabolism of other drugs no metabolites are the same systems now this is particularly relevant some medications there are also sick enzyme metabolized they are clearly relevant things such as phenytoin carbamazepine and clobbers and now the reason they're particularly relevant that they're all anticonvulsants and given that the main indication for CBD maple practice at the moment is for seizures you can see there may well be patients being treated with carbamazepine phenytoin or clobber sam or whom CBD is added and then actually you have to be aware of the drug drug interactions there in terms of pumkin hammock effects you can see them as night before the NZ litigant takes a nice iconic and Coulson an ting climbing tree is awesome and he's there lots of good effects CBD itself actually does not appear to have any psychoactive properties it does not make people intoxicated on the whole there's very little very poor discriminant discrimination of CBD from for SIBO so if you give standard doses of CBD to someone I'm all to see bone on the whole most people can't tell you whether they've had active all to see both drug there's not very little abuse potential and no documented withdrawal and stocking CP and if you measure things like blood pressure prostrate again seemingly doesn't really seem to the most physiological parameters and seeming it is not even a scene to really impact much in the effects of THC in the study these days they have been done there is thought they're adding CBD to THC may reduce some of the adverse events seeing the THC so some of the things that you think's RIT and so forth whether we really need better studies before the nose you can see most life here in the last comments we still don't really understand the mechanism of action of CBD alright so they're the two main cannabinoids of interest it's really one quickly move on then to just mention that cannabis is already quite common in Australia so a number of studies are some of the areas which we know people are interested in such as pain kind of care and epilepsy there's a number of studies that were done with you years ago two three years ago where people were surveying in cross-sectional snapshots or of those patient populations and it was remarkable that this or same number kept cropping up you know in one sample it was 13% and to another 16 another 15 percent the way that's about you know one is 1 in 6 1 in 6 patients with those conditions report using medical cannabis now we've already got some data from the pain population actually what we're seeing is more and more people are interested in using medical cannabis now probably because of all that made your interest now this is not uncommon in Australia that people are turning to illicit cannabis supplies but and using that for medical reasons and in all these studies a recurring theme in all those populations is you know when we ask them and so what made you think about using cannabis for medical reasons and you know must all cases it's because the patients were not satisfied with conventional treatment and the conventional treatment wasn't working or conventional treatment had too many side effects she's going on and I'm sure many of you out there will be familiar there is very strong community support for medical cannabis being legal although it's pretty obvious there they're actually a lot of people don't really know what what is meant by medical cannabis when they say yes it should be legal okay so when we say people are turning to illicit cannabis supplies what does that actually mean now if we're in Canada or in the US you'd be able to order your cannabis and have a good understanding of what is in the bag of cannabis you just bought so for example the top figure there is a strain of cannabis you can buy in Canada and in various dispensaries in the US go in over-the-counter and you buy some Sour Diesel and the man in the shop there or the woman the shop will tell you the Sour Diesel has somewhere between 90 and 25% THC removed in point one point three percent CBD and some other cannabinoids and some other terpenes and so forth or you could buy some can atonic which is the Australian below and you can see that's a lower THC much more CBD and there's dozens and dozens and dozens of different variations now in Australia we actually don't have that technology or ability above to us indeed is fair to say we back only got very poor understanding of what is in Australian cannabis the last published analysis was done with cannabis from over ten years ago so whilst this was published in 2013 the actual cannabis supplies was from over a decade ago where some researchers went and got police leaders and this is what we found what we found was an average THC content of 15% you can see a lot of variation so some samples had almost no THC others wrapper 25% and the vast majority had little or no CBD so huge variation in terms of what we're seeing in Australian cannabis supplies and I guess the concern is that most people have no way of knowing what is in there chemist now the next slide is our saying we've done more recently this is some work Landen suited I'm called the Pelican Sully recently published and it was interviewing a number of families in New South Wales and Queensland who returned to cannabis extracts to treat their children's epilepsy and we asked the families hey what he thinks in the supplies and we actually got the families to give us some cannabis supplies of their kind of sex tracts and we analyze them in the lab most of families expected that there was going to be high CBD in their cannabis supplies and let me around the analyses this is what we found and there's a little bit surprising the majority of these extracts had no CBD in them a large proportion had THC and the bottom panel their kennel Zenith refer to some of the less common sort of cannabinoids so you can see some some had lots of cbc in them others had lots of CBG and this is the variety and cannabinoids are out there so I guess what this flyer tells us is that in Australia there's a lot of people turn to illicit supply and one of the things one of the consistent themes is there is no way of anyone really knowing what is in those supplies so this is a bit of an issue when this was thinking that people are using canvas for medical reasons but to know what's going on when you don't even know what's in the extract that you're using so that's illicit supplies now how do we access regularly supplies in Australia well one way is you look to one of the licensed no buy medicines in Australia we only have one licensed cannabinoid medicine best in the big smiles or saddlebags it is licensed for spasticity there's a whole bunch of information around salivex is a one to one THC CBD formulation it's an oral mucosal spray each sprays got about 2.5 milligrams of each cannabinoid on average the average MS patient users around six to eight and sprays a day so for the average patients around the 15 to 20 milligrams of THC a day some patients use less some patients use a bit more best pretty standard doses the current price in Australia is $250 pour a bottle over the big smile so you get better hundred sprays the coin - the dose you're going to be getting something like one to four weeks supply out of one bottle of salad x2 prescribed I'd Sativex it is a licensed medication you don't need to talk to the TGA all you do is scribble can you write a prescription but before you do that it is a Schedule 8 medication so you do need to consider what is your local government's schedule eight requirements so will you need a permit from your state government putting you south wales for example the answer is yes you do is to schedule a time for special in a permit in the same way if you're in New South Wales I wanted to prescribe an opioid oxycodone for an opioid dependent patient for example I've got to put in an application and it's the same with with describing salivex for any indication now if you're going to describe it for non MS patients than generally what we say is follow the off-label prescribing professional standards if you're going to need to off-label prescribing so most colleges will describe the kinds of professional standards they expect their their learners to follow and when it comes to a book expiring I won't go into that then the other thing you've been hearing about in the media and some of humanity of access is the issue of the unlicensed people keep going on about this special things have been introduced to Australia the reality is there is nothing new about this we are following a an existing regulatory framework for using unlicensed medicines in Australia It's Made nothing new created for cannabis or that so if you want to prescribe an unlicensed medicine in Australia you can either do the special access scheme or an authorized prescriber or a clinical trial now that's the same if you're using an unlicensed chemotherapy drug an unlicensed cannabis product or an unlicensed you know any unlicensed meds what the TGA has done is that they've gone and assessed and fast tracked a number of products medical cannabis products that they've already gone and assessed as meets that their requirements for you know quality production for standard you know product and they've already assessed them and said yep here is a bunch of medical cannabis products that we're happy for Commission's to start using and and so basically supposed to make the process will be easier the other thing that's happened now is most states have gone and linked a special access application to the TGA each of their local state health department so that you're only having to put in one set of applications but I would suggest check with your local state health department because each jurisdiction is doing something slightly different as to how they are linking up the Commonwealth TGA with your State Health Department requirements now again none of these products are subsidized by the pig yes there are licensed products you cannot have that unlicensed product subsidized by the PDS and most patients are having to fork out about ten to twenty dollars per week for a THC product much much more for a CBD product seemingly is much more expensive now also what we are seeing is increasingly more and more capsules tablets extracts in oils and drops what we are moving away from with less and less and less uptake his plant matter you know where you get a bag of cannabis plant for a range of reasons is really difficult to handle plant matter difficult distort it go to dispense difficult prescribe difficult to regulate difficult difficult difficult out lots of levels it is so much easier for us as doctors to prescribe a standardized product like tablets or capsules is easier for pharmacists it's easier for patients so I think what we'll be seeing more and more of in Australia is that it is is sort of our step a nice product like a normal medicine rather than us prescribing in a half a gram of cannabis to be vaporized per day and Jenny what you have an option of his either case the only products or combinations entities CBD or some CBD now want to get more information about what these products are I refer you to the website Australian government website it's the office of Drug Control your hot one here and it's got everything you need to know as a doctor is a patient pretty much this walks into that a lot you will walk through and see the kinds of products that are available so this is just one website sorry I'm much my man I'm not trying to advertise for these companies is just the page that I pulled up the website at so for example you will see the first one there is Health House international they have got three products at the time that I downloaded this it might be different by now and you can see they have a product called one 220 cannonade oil that's THC one will CBD 20 milligrams for milk you can buy a 60 ml bottle of that and you can figure out how much they actually say babies in that and if you want to use that product you you ring up your house international you contact them and you speak to their provider and then you start your you're teaching a special access so now there are over 30 products on this on this website that you should be able to go in and start using and you contact the local companies and they'll give you a sense of price and so alright so that's what the products are if in Australia one of your sense of you know where do I find some guidelines and some guidance the TGA had put out some guidance throughout the years and we just cannabis if you search medical cannabis guidelines TGA in Google this will come up a rash in here you'll find a whole bunch of generic guidelines around this particle cover some good practice tips and they've got specific diets for epilepsy nausea vomiting MS and party care now if you say in there also there's a group of researchers from in dark have done some systematic reviews of different areas of evidence this another sort of standard systematic reviews these are considered the gold standard there have been done since the TGA refused paper from 2015 very high quality system aggregation so the kinds of areas the diaries and you can see most areas don't have good good evidence lower quality evidence in most cases comes from chronic pain the the JAMA papers summarized the chronic pain and you can see there there meta-analysis was said it was just favorable in that cannabis use works better than placebo is the National Academies of science systematic review they summarize their evidence inside this snapshot here where they say you know there's good conclusive evidence for the conditions on the far left and if you go over to the far right you see areas where they say at the time of finding that there wasn't good evidence you can see there's a slight variation for model time next in terms of paint they week they make such slightly different conclusions in some of the evidence but the evidence is the same they all go and pull the same papers the same studies and informing so you know the these kinds of summaries all right so they're the reasons why we might want to use cannabis now also little bit adverse events most of the world's understanding of the problems of cannabis come from our understanding of illicit cannabis use now we need some caveats in here so ELISA Candace you so if you guys all know it tends to be really high potency THC with low CBD levels it tends to be smoked and so what you're seeing with smoke you know either joints or bombs is very high concentration high potency and often really high doses so you need to accept that when extrapolating about one of the harms of cannabis use from an illicit population it's a little bit like saying let's look at the harms that our heroine Alisa heroine user has when they're using heroin and from there we will extrapolate back what the side effects of oxycodone are in a patient prescribed oxycodone for back pain now you can see it's not really apples and apples there but yeah there's a there's a common factor there in you know heroin is an opioid and oxycodone DS arnott is an opioid but what are the problems of heroin are not going to be the same as the problems of taking your endo as as we know working the addiction field probably better than anything the effect of any drug is not just the pharmacology it's about the drug it's about the individual using the drug and is the broader setting context so if we want to understand what a drug does you need to understand all those issues and it's why we need to take you know some of the issues of the harms identifier around illicit cannabis use and recognizer an issue but not necessarily equate that they're all going to be exactly same as medical anyway what can we say about potential harms a twist of cannabis use there is a wonderful whi monograph that came out two years ago around elissa cannabis in your arms Wayne Hall was the lead author on that note we strongly suggest you interested in a good summary of this go look at the WHI monograph most of us know this stuff we work in addictions we know that the harms of visit cannabis there's cognitive problems my suppose that very short term may settle down there is of course concern around some long term cognitive problems associated with heavy persistent cannabis use in adolescence and that probably tends to probably be about the only groups where we can say it seems to be irreversible effects of long term can it tends to be in those individuals who are using cannabis very heavily in adolescence and we know this from other drugs adolescent you know heavy drinkers end up having permanent deficits as well but we know adolescents and heavy drug use don't go all together the other area of course of interest is mental health there's a lot of interest in you know his cannabis related psychosis a lot of ink has been put on this I think now I think that most people have settled on the idea of cannabis contributes to and exacerbates psychosis in those people that tend to have a vulnerability so there isn't many experts in this area who would argue that cannabis causes long-term permanent psychosis or a functional psychosis on its own I don't think any experts will argue that rather they see cannabis in vulnerable individuals will certainly exacerbate and worse and outcomes and so this is relevant we need to be aware some of the other harms dependence will be coming back to that zone of focus and this one that's peaceful so that's what we can say about illicit cannabis use now when we look at prescribed medical cannabis products so you can see there is a nice room table from a journal Pedro McCallum and Ross I think I've got the reference and another slide and this is so nicely breaks down what we can expect be the more common versus the common and the rare kinds of adverse events of course generally as most areas of medicine from rare events tend to be the ones we are more worried about and so some of the concerns around some of the severe mental health problems fortunately tend to be rare the other things we can say around adverse events with cannabinoids like things such as opioids most of the endless events occur early and a transient and jemmye sell down as tourist products most of the side effects have dose related so a common problem with cannabis is prescribing medical cannabis you is describing too high a dose early on and generally what you need to do is most medical camps in a non tolerant user so you know non cannabis user generally you should be looking at a two to four week titration period to reach your target envy so you need to slowly increase the dose over a two if you look at medical cannabis trials and generally we see around 20% to 30% of patients actually drop out of and studies of medical cannabis usually because of side effects so you know we need to appreciate not everyone actually likes cannabis and just want to highlight that's about the same proportion of patients that drop out of opioid studies but it's not unusual about 27 patients dropped out of these trials and they usually don't like the effects of cannabis now of course a lot of people have emphasized about the concerns around long-term cognition I'm and prescribing medical cannabis I've always thought this is a little bit disingenuous Cindy because not many of us can actually identify really any condition where we would be you know prescribing long term THC based medicines to adolescence so most of the conditions that people are thinking about where you would prescribe a THC based medicine such as chronic pain such as palliative care chemotherapy let me tend to be an older people so you know the concerns around long-term cognitive problems that we you know genuinely need to be concerned about with adolescents probably we're overstating some of those concerns and if you are going to get psychiatric complications well first and foremost I think we always need to be cautious we probably should be rushing in with a THC based medicine in an individual with a history of psychosis or severe anxiety especially it is a drug-induced psychosis or panic attacks for example but you know avoid THC basement in those patients if you're gonna see adverse events then generally we gonna see have fewer concerns again as we said slow titration use low doses avoid things are going to result in a high peak concentration so maybe avoiding how route see you're not seeing that I see max probably throwing lots of CBD you know how to suggest misting CBD dampen some of the psychotic effects of tea actually if a patient those experiencing psychiatric adverse events and the rules families stop the cannabis consider symptomatic medication for treatment of the adverse event and probably it means THC is probably not a good medication if you are having psychosis or panic attacks or anxiety link to your TLC's alright I'm just looking Tyler what time you know there's any questions or point of clarification around the around the general medical cannabis stuff cuz now is going to go into some of the more a dictionary things around cannabis use disorders and so forth tori is there anything I need to do it to anyone had any questions you could just type it into the chat and I'm happy to rate it out that's all the generic medical calendar stuff hopefully you've seen us up before and now ones are so move on to some of the starters a little bit more interesting for us in the addiction space the first is this issue around the idea that we are seeing more and more and more people who are going to be wanting to use a medical cannabis product a number of conditions which are chronic long-term conditions so chronic pain potentially epilepsy is an area where some people are wanting to use THC based medicines I'm proud of care a lot of a sort of thing I kind of care means think I mean you know okay so we're gonna be dead in a few weeks I think many of us now identifying there are actually many patients I'm Ida hunt answer or encounter can actually live for many many many years so everything a number of chronic disease conditions that people are wanting to use THC based medicines and one of the things we need to be aware of is the potential there for the development over dependence of the cannabis in exactly the same way we can expect some patients who are prescribed benzos for their anxiety or sleep become dependent employees some patients prescribed opioids for pain become dependent to opioids well we should be alert to some patients being prescribed a THC based medicine for a long-term medical condition make it come into their cannabis so what do we know about this already in terms of the studies when we go and look at the RCTs of cannabis products and no one has ever measured it so Noah is actually set up like a medical cannabis study say for pain or for cancer for any other reason without God and actually looked at the development of addiction we shall be surprised because if you look at the whole world of opioid treatment for example for pain you know we're talking about you know dozens if not hundreds of trials of opioids and very rarely will a drug company ever ask about addiction so that's not surprising there in the studies that have been done today no one's really been paying attention to it so the studies don't inform us epidemiological studies well what can we say say looking at the US there's been some work done where they go for example and pull the Epis data from states comparing those that ask Michael kammes law as to those who haven't and what they've been I was saying that those jurisdictions in those states that have medical marijuana laws there is a slightly higher rate of illicit cannabis use and of cannabis use disorders but that's big Eddy data and we can't say whether or not that is an increase rate of cannabis use disorders in patients prescribed many for cannabis or is that a general population effect so the MP studies don't really help us when we've gone look at surveys of medical cannabis users well again we're a little bit surprised about this no ones are asking so there's been quite a lot of studies where they've asked surveyed medical cannabis users overseas in America Canada Europe and actually none of those researchers have actually asked about developing addiction to the medical cannabis and that probably highlights that many people running those surveys tend to be pro medical cannabis and they're not interested in asking about any bad things associated with a medical cannabis I'm an assister generalization don't hold me to that but I've always found it odd why isn't anyone asking these cannabis medical cannabis patients about you know do you get withdrawal are you becoming addicted the only study that we've been able to pull out is the study that we did of course ask the addiction people we ask these questions so in the chronic pain cohort in dark have been running you will see there of the people who said that they had used cannabis for pain 14% of those met icd-10 criteria for cannabis dependence and double met but any form of the cannabis use disorder you can think about that folks because if we think about what we known from general cannabis use there's this rule of thumb of about 1 in 10 about 10 percent of cannabis users elicit cannabis users become dependent and here we've got a number about 14% so it's not different so I'm gonna see some data on a survey that we did call cam 16 cannabis is missing so this is coming out in NJ hey next months and a few additions it was a survey with 1,700 people on line to be eligible all you had to do was hop online and say I've use cannabis for for a medical reason in the last four months and does that we asked a whole bunch of questions to give people a sense of who they were so 1,700 people 6% male they largely employed 57% were employed Omar Cantrell University Facebook was where they were largely true you can see mental health pain were the main kinds of conditions that people said was the main reason they were using a medical cannabis and a smattering of other conditions down the bottom in terms of who these people were about half said that they were using cannabis at the time that they started using medical cannabis about 1/3 said I had used cannabis you know in my when I was a kid barely known you know back when I was at university but I stopped using and I started using canvas again for medical reasons and about 14% said I've never used cannabis in my life and the first time I ever used it was or medical cannabis use so not everyone using medical cannabis should be characterized as you know they're all just stoners Aiona you know excuse-excuse their their use of cannabis you know calling it medical if you can see here cholera people we're not using cannabis and actually for therapeutic reasons see the age progression there you know first canvas use that eighteen first regular at 24 first use of medical at 27 and first regular 29 these people using cannabis 19 days out of 28 on average five times a day or they our median of 3 and you can see about 80% on originally people said the average was ages of the canvas use was for medical reasons you can see most people are using bongs vaporizers or oral now we asked a bunch of questions and they are that relates to campuses who saw the first was after a regular use heavy prolonged use when you stop do you get any of the following symptoms within several days we use the dsm-5 criteria for canvas with floral these are the symptoms and you can see there so a thousand people endorse that they had some chemists symptoms so and the most common one was sleep difficulties so about two-thirds of people endorse that they had some sleep difficulty when stopping regular cannabis use restlessness nervousness anxiety with the other common ones and when you look at the Sun total Hemi met three or more criteria its forty three percent so forty three percent of people saying that they're using medical cannabis experience cannabis withdrawal appreciably simple criteria when they try to have a break on the Animus use that's pretty high I think and third needs a mission we need to be aware of if we're going to be using and prescribing medical campus leave them are interested about what portion people would meet dsm-5 high-tier for cannabis use disorder where you are the system five criteria you're all familiar with them we've now got mild moderate and severe chord and critique now when we also though I'm to medicine or a therapeutic so would you be familiar there are dsm-5 allows you to take time from withdrawal out of the equation so we recall so examine you're describing opioids to a patient and they're using it as medically prescribed the taurah smith drawl I'm not part of the s UD criteria so you got a different set of rules unless the patient is not taking it as medically prescribed in which case that's called you know tourism at all are thrown back in again so if we want to turn you know has to be measured with medical cannabis use he's a really medical Shh could we be excluding Torrance and withdraw if someone is pulling thirty cones before breakfast does that is that really what we mean by a medical cannabis you know I don't think any of us would prescribe thirty bucket bonds for breakfast but that's what some people are doing so how do we identify what is genuine as medically prescribed and so forth and things really difficult whilst in the world of illnesses supplies I think we kind of probably going to struggle with that well the reason I raise these issues is because according to how you define what's in and what's out will determine what proportion of people have a canvas use disorder so on the far link you'll see there if you just went with a traditional 11 criteria basically what we found is in this cannabis use population medical cannabis use population 40% met a cannabis use disorder and 17% 16.9% met dependence criteria that's with with using all 11 criteria if you have your explosions at the other end of the you know so if you take tolerance and withdrawal out of the equation and the numbers are much lower it's about half that number meet criteria for cannabis use disorder so that's quite important for us actually really one of the wings did some work to look at other predictors of cannabis use disorder could we identify who's more likely to meet those criteria you know we ran a whole bunch of regression models and basically what we found was probably the the most consistent there is the extent to which people are using canvas for non-medical reasons so that's the percentage canvas used as medical as Anakin's there as well I'm not saying these are the definitive big business much more work needs to be done this is the kind of work that we need to start doing you know getting a better understanding if we say something like 10 or 20% of medical cannabis patients might become dependent to their medical cannabis then we need to be able to identify who those people are you know who were the risks all right now what does this mean for us clinically I would like us to think about this in the edition space to think through the whole idea of how did we get opioids and benzos so horribly wrong in medicine and can we learn from that now the pain doctors have worked from us they realize that you know opioid prescribing got a little bit out of hand and they had to sort of Rayna Becky you know nothing nice for certain I'm familiar with this universal precaution framework but some Canadian pain doctors for over a decade ago and now I sort of getting today's the way we should be I mean opioids and the idea there is you screen your patients to identify who are those at risk of developing are these very same you need more research there to identify the predictors that you then adjust how you put how you provide me equal cannabis treatment according to the risks and addictions we're really good at this think about it you know patients who are we consider to be stable and doing well we give them more takeaways we review them less often we do a few a urine drug screens a high-risk patients we do more of that kind of stuff so this for us is like falling off a log we know this stuff in addictions because we do this stuff all the time and then the other area limiting true is if someone actually is cannabis depend don't medical cannabis dependent well how you gonna treat that patient as a little bit like when we identify somebody's opioid dependent and they have chronic pain well we have to treat that patient differently to the non dependent pain patient so one thing we need to think about other doses we would all appreciate their hope you're dependent trained patient often these higher doses than the non dependent patient that's probably what we're going to be seeing for our medical cannabis patients as well so for example the traditional dose of THC for a non toyline on dependent patient is usually ten to thirty milligrams a day and yet when we're thinking about treating you know cannabis dependent patients and we actually is the doses tend to be more in that forty to our hundred milligrams a day so this is where we need a better understanding of if someone is dependent to their cannabis how are we going to treat that patient different so the patient is not so these are all the issues that we as addiction doctors need start now this is what I mean by could we start applying universal precautions this is from an author in Canada we started to think along these lines I won't go through the whole thing here but you can see if you work through this diagram based on what they and two is a decision point where they say hey here's the patient willing to consider marijuana if yes then determine the risk if there is a risk coordinate with appropriate substance abuse of psychiatric resource you look at the risk benefits and then you consider well nice work providing a treatment but this is where we're going to with opioids I am arguing that we should eat we should start the world of medical cannabis treatment with this system in place not met medical cannabis rollout and then 10 years trying trying to put the horse packing in the stable oh that's a bad metaphor metonymy already died so that's the the key shoe so I guess what my point is dependency cannabis is an expected side effect it's going to happen and it's going to happen in about 10 to 20 percent of patients which is probably what we're seeing with opioids and benzos as well and cannabis withdrawal is going to be even more common than than the full body hindrance and that we as addiction specialists I think we need to step up to the plate and take leadership in these issues alright I've got a small amount of time it's quickly one of them going to whiz through cannabis and the treatment substance use disorders it's up until now you know what some patients will accidentally become dependent to their medical cannabis I wanted our swing to this issue about how are we addiction specialist and in the AR DS vector how do we use medical cannabis products to treat substance use disorders so the first area that you know the best interest here was the issue of can we use cannabis the on campus products who helped treat cannabis withdrawal now guys logic as nicotine replacement therapy for nicotine withdrawal buprenorphine for treating you know heroin withdrawal and so forth Dave Alsop was really the person that drove much of this research we ran on your study in New South Wales a few years ago I published in JAMA psychic and we established that salivex significantly better than placebo and medication double bond double diamond stud Ebola that our patients more patients finished the study you know finish detox and there's less severity withdrawal so given we know we don't have any effective medications for cannabis withdrawal this raises the issue of should we have this as you know one of the options in our back pockets for those patients who we know really struggle with cannabis withdrawal or you might be thinking for the patient being admitted to hospital for another procedure not between cannabis you know they break their leg whatever dependent and at the moment we don't do much for those patients so they try to find them under the water and these are the patients are never impaired there are the ward smoking joints you know in the smokers shed so they're the ones that we struggle with sometimes in a hospital and the question is should we be thinking about possibly using something like the big smiles occasionally for those kinds of patients in Southie Sydney we're about to start exploring this and how we introduce procedures for our hospitals but be able to have this as an option for our Hospital drug na+ field so that's withdrawal now of course one things that we did with their chemist withdrawal from e we found people up and as we expected with mass detox as most people would relapsed not surprisingly because that's what detox does so this is raised the issue of if we're not never gonna relapse is there a role for longer term cannabis agonist treatment or substitution treatment treat whatever you want to call it I'm using the term cat cannabinoid agonist treatment and because that tends to be the flavor of the month or how we refer to opioid subsidy we don't call it opioid substitution treatment I'm calling it no hope your agonist treatment so I've used that language here canaveral eggless treatment cap so it shouldn't we be these are a role for the canaveral Integris treatment for treating cannabis dependent patients so there'd be some interesting word small studies or you know done in america we got a grant I mean ran this study just finished so it hasn't hasn't been published yet so please do not please don't disseminate the star anywhere but for your benefits you can see me around a parallel group RCT about 128 patients made into the analysis you can see what we in terms of the trigger attention it was the big smile spasibo no difference in retention between between groups you can see the doses that we were using is about a mean of twenty sprays a day which is about 7500 huh so twenty on twenty times two one five so what was it about 60 milligrams I think in the end up name was about 50 60 milligrams a day double the standard dose that we use for non dependent people so this what I mean by when you're treating a cannabis dependent person 10 milligrams of THC which works in a non dependent person is not going to be enough we're gonna have to use higher doses and where we know this stuff you know addiction what we expect so alt bindings our key bindings were significantly less cannabis use in terms of cafes in the big small town and these four great lease poorgrass all pretty much demonstrate that so significantly fewer cannabis who stays in the big smiles arm and then the percy bow and this this so we should give the time and the general conclusion here was that and the big smiles was effectively reducing illicit cannabis this is the first ICT to demonstrate this while RCT does not make an evidence-based we probably need some replication studies but i think there is a lot of interest in pursuing this work especially for those people that try conventional treatments for chemist dependence and i just finish up then very very quickly cannabis or opioid use disorder lots of interesting animal work some laboratory studies we still actually don't have any good clean glass eighties to date there's a study from land lab work which showed that when a banal which is a synthetic THC at big doses so thirty milligrams was was you know better than placebo and in the right direction but not as good as giving someone oxycodone thirty milligrams so you know cannabinoids are good but they're not as good as giving someone an opioid okay with laurel there's a lot more work needs to be done and there's a lot of interest also Mississippi's area there as we know working in metro and there's a lot of people they use cannabis to avoid using other more problematic drugs whilst amygdala I just want to highlight down there that was quite a lot of people responded to our cam sixteen survey saying that they were using cannabis to treat their addiction this surprised our section we didn't know that this is already happening in Australia there you go there's also a lot of interest for CBD for alcohol and feta means we're about start a study in Sydney looking at CBD for alcohol withdrawal and Sydney Uni is leading that that study along with Sydney and southeastern erh days and there's some interest in using sea maintained for stimulant disorders it seems worth very well for me and better main dependent rats so we need to see whether or not can we translate some the animal data into human work as well so you can see there's a lot of excitement about where the cannabinoids might have a role you know as a therapeutic agent a lot more work needs to be done and I just want to conclude over time not bad for me right so as fiction specialists you know we should have our own influencing how the Trenton systems roll out in Australia we need to be aware that a significant minority of patients will develop a chemist use disorder from their medical cannabis use we need to be thinking about how are we influencing med medicine in you know you know with our colleagues for us to so be thinking about a universal precaution approach from the outset not sort of you know she's letting the systems roll out and then realizing gosh we've got a lot of you know a digit patients you know we should plan ahead and then ultimately what is going to be the role of medical cannabis products you know as a treatment for substance use disorder and in particular the easiest you know the most obvious areas is should we be you know pursuing the cannabis agnus treatment for those people with Hindus and I'm gonna stop talking and throwing it throw it open for any questions this time okay so we will now begin the Q&A I just reminder you may submit questions through the Q&A questions pane on your control panel and I'll be reading them out if you wanted to answer professor Lazarus are you ready great okay from Jennifer de Lima excuse me if I get any words wrong are there serum iron levels that may assist with expectation of therapeutic effect can you just reread them again and they were our this serum or serum urine levels that may assist with expectation of therapeutic effect okay all right so probably no urines and cannabinoids are really problematic so my drugs I can't that means opioids and so forth there is a pretty good relationship between recent use and detection in urines the problem of the cannabinoids all of them they are so lipid soluble that they accumulate in lipid and they slowly are released over time so if you are a chronic regular user you can get positive cannabinoids showing up in your urine for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks and it is not a very it's not a it's not a linear decay so what I mean by that is you might have a quantitative level this week say 400 nano grams per mil without using again with that without using you come back next week you could give a urine and it could be 450 nanograms per mil it's gone up so urines clumsy clumsy clumsy in terms of understanding there are Punic levels for the cannabinoids cannabinoids can I suggest they're a little bit like opioids it's less about the kinetics and it's more about the dynamics if you want to know a cannabinoid is doing worry less about your your plasma levels and look at the clinical effects it's a little bit like opioids you know we don't we we rarely ever do think about it there's almost no role for therapeutic oh empioyed levels and that's probably where we are with the okay next question and Michael is asked with Australian doctor magazine reporting that there are clinics hot-off-the-press ready to roll out multi-site clinics just for cannabis how will we or anyone be able to lead the discussion saying wrong well so there there are lots of ways to be fluently things so participating in position statements you know the college for example accent you know what is drug is there a consensus position around what we should be doing with medical cannabis in the addiction field in Australia and I would argue we've never had those debates we've never I think there's a lot of polarity in the space of we should not be surprised that private medicine is going to step up and run with this because that's what private medicine does I'm knowing drug and alcohol we are shielded a little bit from from the realities of private medicine we tend to work either a government sector NGOs and so forth but the reality you know is this is what happens you know most innovation and nimbleness happens in private practice not in clumsy government sector but it was always going to be the case that you're going to get private practitioners we're gonna run with this so that's not a surprise I almost could not see anything else happening other than that anyone thought that we're going to control medical cannabis I was dreaming I mean it was never going to happen because that's just not the way medicine happens right no we're not going to overly control entirely manager so for example the big smiles is a good example at the moment says schedule eight the company is actually looking to reschedule it as a schedule for if it got a schedule for listing then you need no approval from anyone to prescribe in a big smiles there will be no regulatory oversight at all will be like prescribing any other medicine like an antibiotic and we have to ask ourselves and is that a problem you know we prescribe benzos as scheduled force because meme us would argue boy we've missed benzos up but you know in context that cannabinoids are probably safer than the benzos in terms of logic so yeah look it's a really nice thing that the cat is getting out of the bag that the idea that we are going to overly tightly regulate the cannabinoids I think medicine needs to realize that our ability to do that is limited and if we try to over-regulate it then we will see in Australia what happened pretty much everywhere else in the world they will bypass the doctors that's what's happened we were else largely medical cannabis in America in in you know in Europe in Canada has largely occurred by passing that it really engage copy of the slides no can they have a copy without containing I'm your unpublished data yes certainly so yeah there's a few slides here that I would take the the data wrap not many and I'm more than happy to make them available and nice check how do I make this an auditory do I just send it to me and then I'll send them to our webinar lady and chill distributed great okay next question thanks Nick evidence of opiate opiod despairing effects in medicinal THC users are you convinced no one should be convinced because the data isn't there there's a beautiful review that see is innocent lead it's been published where we pull all the animal work and all the human work with you know cured sparing and in many areas of cannabinoids the data just isn't there I mean it's not that the data suggests it doesn't the data is just bad I mean the studies haven't been done well especially men talking about human work the only goal is and lots and lots of indirect evidence we've got a logical work many of you would have seen the EPI data with a you know looked at jurisdictions of America with medical cannabis and those without medical cannabis and now looking at overdose rates and all that kind of stuff that's all interesting work it's teasing it's interesting but the evidence is I think we've gotta be really you know spade a spade the data is not convincing either way and is another thing that we gotta do more work on and clinically I think we've all seen it haven't we we've all seen patients many of us have seen patients that will describe they don't need the opioids anymore why not because they're basically now using cannabis instead but again lots of individual case individual cases and anecdotes does not an evidence make so there probably is something there it probably works in some patients with some kinds of pain conditions but other labardi you know there's a lot more witness program ok questions if titrating up to commence our X does withdrawal take into account titrating down versus abrupt cessation withdraw versus versus discontinuation the American question and the kind of addiction doctors need to be driving the agenda on so for example if the patient was on a medical campus product for a long period of time well we should never recommend just stop the drug we should be recommending a tapering down phase and as and that's the kind of stuff that that need is that kind of legal information that we need to be making sure he's going into guidance around how to use medical cannabis product to date you'll find again if you we don't have that level of certainty in our documents in in our guidelines in Australia if you pull some of the guidelines from overseas you look at some of the Canadian guidelines Israeli guidelines a lot of those guidelines aren't really even mention withdrawal from cannabis so yeah I will report that yes we should be thinking about you know tapers not some associations okay next question with Oh a tea we are reducing injecting and overdose rates what would be the hard measurable benefits of C 80 well let's be really clear one of the benefits of o 80 is reducing injecting it's only one route of administration yeah now if you look to say in the u.s. majority people entering a 80 have non injectors they're actually you know oxycontin addicts so route of administration is a really important thing dare I say that is also one of the reasons on the benefits can cannabinoid agamous treatment so the average punter entering our our salivex RCT was bogging to three grams of cannabis a day that's bonds to ask ourselves is it a good outcome if you took the patient who was longing you're using water bomb in a bonds or joints smoking with tobacco and so forth he's moving on to an oral Prada a better thing and I think most of us say yeah rid of administration certainly is one thing what are the other potential you know benefits that you see with with opioid ministry one of the things is you know why don't we call a substitution anymore we don't call a substitution is because it's not just about giving them the drug that's why we've moved away from referring it to substitution treatment that just makes it sound as odd you just want mean one drug for another you know y'all and for about what's wrong with Mythili well I would argue methadone is a heck of a lot more than just swapping one drug for another you get your health care wrapped around from psychosocial interventions you're moving to a safer route of administration you're actually moving away from hopefully drug networks dealer networks the other thing is going to do this controlling you know dose levels and things like that so it's easier to not be you know us using it it's like 20 years you now as you say nicotine replacement versus and I consider it so of course the harms of cannabis dependence are nowhere near as severe as heroin dependence so the underlying condition is not as severe as heroin at the same time I think many of us would say it's as severe as nicotine dependence and no one is saying we should be doing nicotine replacement no one says that we're all supportive of that well I would argue there's not much difference between a cannabinoid agonist treatment and you contain replacement you know you know the rationale we did find some other things which I haven't gone into now you know so we found crime went down in the in the big small spaces in a safer route improvements in general health greater access to health care counseling taking amount of drug networks less prime there are all the kinds of harm reduction you type you know arguments have been used for for methadone and in our team okay we're going to have four questions to go so opioids bearing an opioid OD reduction in some US states where medical cannabis available I think yeah yeah so that's the empanada that will find him before yep and the biological data it's mine but it's big dialer you know it's as good as the data that goes in there's lots of variable this is really address all the confounders you rarely ever find only one thing changed so what I mean by that is you know in society there are lots of things that will impact upon opioid use and opioid related harms medical cannabis laws are just one of them you know have you introduced you know education programs for your doctors have you introduced up your stewardship programs in your ad departments did you introduce prescription monitoring have you changed the pack size when you Jeremy there's so many things that will impact upon opioid related harms and yes those studies tried to factor as much as they possibly could but an epi study is just an epi study it's good it was use certain types of things but we should be cautious about extrapolating to say we've got good evidence that if I described a cannabinoid for my pain patient should expect that they will use the less opioids and that's what we mean by opioid sparing and we don't have their evidence nailed yet we haven't got those studies done okay next question either the same conclusions for CBD as well as THC or is that there is just very little research on CBD so it is not known or a couple of gosh the conclusions well CBD look if we just step back a bit about CBD see me they think about CBD pure CBD essentially it's sort of gonna be regulated in a very different way it's already a schedule for medicine so it's not schedule a drug and it's non psychoactive so we don't have the concerns about a people going to get a teacher to see me in doing the answer is no I think adjacent CBD no but they're going to end up in IDI with a psychotic reaction to CBD no none of that stuff all that is THC stuff not CBD stuff of course you know the media doesn't differentiate often about CBD or THC they wrap it all up into medical cannabis and so that's where we as clinicians need to understand their CBD is a fundamental different product to THC and once we have a licensed product in Australia so at the dialects probably we expect will be licensed as a medicine sometime in the next 12 to 24 months then we'll be able to start to prescribe CBD without any special access any of that kind of stuff just as another medicine on label and off label and we'll start using it for a number of conditions the thing about CBD it's a bit expensive as a medicine if you want a plant extract relatively cheap if you make it synthetically in in a bucket in the laboratory and I think that's what you're going to end up finding most of the cannabinoids in ten years time I think we're going to see a proliferation of synthetic cannabinoids and not plant-based ones simply because it's just too bloody expensive to grow a plant and extract the T ace the THC kind of his THC you know a molecule is a molecule there's a whole world of argument about entourage effects and all that kind of stuff to another discussion but with CBD I my expectation is that seeming will be flooded with synthetic CBD products within a few years okay do you think that those who bypass professionals are among people who might use MC I'm sorry people-people to bypass do you think that those who buy parts professionals are among people who might use MC so I'm currently now in Australia the majority of people who are using cannabis for a therapeutic reason are sourcing illicit cannabis products and their doctors and their health providers are not involved in any of that work so that's the that's the historical background we there's probably still fewer than 2000 people in Australia they have been prescribed a medical cannabis product legally this we don't know but there's probably somewhere between ten and a hundred thousand people using cannabis in their mind for a therapeutic reason okay can we say then that products with low THC are likely to be less than dick do probable yeah well specify mean by low THC so look at the end of day let's be really clear what matters is the dose of THC not the proportion in the products what I mean by that is you might have a 10 to 1 CBD product or a 1 to 1 so CBD THC a ten-to-one CBD THC here a 1 to 1 CBD THC at the end of the day the probable addictiveness of that medicine has to do with the total milligrams of THC consumed not how much CBD was in it so at the end of the day it's probably the milligrams of THC consumed that matters less so what the you know what the other cannabinoids doing okay we don't have any RCTs for the use of parachutes either but people still use the darn things yeah I know I'm not sure what that means sorry yes there are many things in medicine that are just standards of care we don't have our CTS around should you do a clinical assessment when you first see a patient that's a standard of care yeah I don't think we should be equating the use of a medicine as and the need for an evidence space around it as the same as it's a parachute an anecdote is anecdotally know as you can go find lots of people out there that say you know you know that lots of snake oil sounds people as well oh and you can hop on the internet there is a lot of medical cannabis snake oil heaps in the health profession we do need to sort of say look somewhere in this we do need to look for an evidence base so you know people saying that there's enough evidence out there we don't need more evidence do not understand how medicine interprets evidence and the people who pay see also then you know someone into the spectrum we've done it hit anymore research the evidence well sorry zine then these products would be there would be no trouble of licensing these with the TGA but you know the evidence required to licensure medicine isn't there for most of these indications the indications the other in the spectrum we've got a whole bunch of you know dare I say shall call them slightly more conservative people who are saying until we have all the evidence you know and we should never even contemplate using it and that's the other end of the spectrum and look it plays out very neatly if you look at the area of chronic pain where the evidence is you know whose review de studies they all end up with the same meta-analysis they end up with the saying you know odds ratios and then it's not what people don't be spared the odds ratio people dispute how to interpret it so you have some pain experts are saying the evidence is good enough for us to user in pain treatment as a second line therapy you have other pain expert same the very same evidence is not good enough for us to use it and we should never use until there's more evidence so these are reputable pain experts each looking at the evidence and coming up with different conclusions so this is not parachutes you know I think we can just dismiss the introduction of a of a medication you know for talking about THC we're on the house side effects one that is dependence forming and one that you know is not without its potential risks you know I think we do need to you know come up with an evidence base for and I'm not just saying well you know it's like you know if it's it's completely harmless and people should just be able to buy it over the counter that's an argument for legalization I'm more than happy to engage in that argument but it's a different set of questions to a doctor prescribing it for a medical indication they start confused those arguments all right next question any developments on cannabinoid receptor blocking drugs for cannabis dependence treatments so some of you would be familiar in the old days we had Ramana bent which was cb-one antagonist and there was a lot of interest in ramallah bed uncle indeed and the James Bell had marked montebello from when we actually did a small study looking at Ramana band in cannabis dependence Ramada bandage she got taken off the market got my boxed there were some concerns around some the synaptic profile and so no one's ever been able to get their hands on ramana band again and I don't think anyone will get their things on Ramana band again in a hurry I don't think it's being developed that these are the cannabinoids and tag of cannabinoid antagonists are interesting it's a little bit like what happens when you start playing with opioid antagonist and it's asking a little bit difficult because okay you have an endogenous opioid system so we started miss seeing with that endogenous system you started getting unintended effects which is what the problem with Ramana band because all these other symptoms that we weren't expecting it's the problem with all of antagonists it's kind of like you start prescribing it for one reason but you you know it causes other concerns so now trick so one you're familiar one of the problems we have now trick zone is you know dysphoria gut problems in the first month and a lot of that is you know says be damned in down your euro cure system think it's fair to say guys anyone who is holding out that the future of addiction treatment is an antagonist a blocker probably needs to go back and re-examine all the work that's been done in this area for other addiction drugs in a nutshell we have struggled to really bring any antagonist to market therapeutically and for it to have widespread uptake okay and final question sometimes even when we do have the evidence use is still legal for example cigarettes and alcohol so we need to be separating them the idea of and I really think we need to get our heads together around this one I would like us to be able to talk about the difference between you know medical cannabinoids and and where we're going as doctors you know and how we're going to be thinking about about the use of cannabinoids as medicine needs to be dissociated from illicit cannabis use in the same way we talk about people's oxycodone use and we would never confuse that are and with their heroin we would when we know is kind of one thing of guys heroin and oxycodone are pretty different you know in most ways and that's what you know that's how we should be thinking about medical cannabis and and and you know all of us for other non-medical reasons so we have an evidence that opioids work for certain medical conditions but they are still illegal outside of medical reasons benzodiazepines are legal if a doctor prescribes them they are illegal if not prescribed by a doctor and none of us have got a problem with that so why do we get confused with the cannabinoids why can't we have an evidence base and and a drug which we use therapeutically as a medicine but also recognize that some people going to use a similar drug for other reasons for non-medical reasons and I think we need to get better at differentiating those so the ambulance base we are talking about is coming at an evidence for cannabinoids for epilepsy another noids for alcohol treatment never noise for pain that probably doesn't have any bearing on a legalization argument for me or for cannabis different discussions"
SQHRvIgWGLg,The Current State of Medicinal Cannabis in Australia - Dr David Feng and Adam Miller,2020-06-01T23:56:43Z,so we've got a really great session scheduled for today um joining us on the webinar is dr david fang he's the medical director for canada health and also a fellow of the royal australian college of general practitioners david's been practicing in general practice for the past 10 years and also on the call is adam miller adam is one of australia's leading medical cannabis business consultants uh he's the head of strategic accounts for many farm labs uh cannabis extraction powerhouse here in australia he's also the founder of the medical cannabis council featured in often featured in various uh publications and also runs his own own newsletter that that we here at canada.love and we'll um tell you how to sign up to that during the webinar okay guys uh over to you thanks again evan for joining us so appreciate your uh your time today first and foremost we can just go through how um how you got into the medicinal cannabis space it's a really you know rapidly changing field of um medicine and i was hoping you could maybe give us a bit of a rundown about your background how you got into it and you know what got you excited about this field yeah of course uh first off kevin thanks for the introduction and david thank you very much for having me uh very much a supporter of the work that you're doing so how i got into the cannabis space very much a right place right time type scenario in 2015 i had an intuition after reading about some of the some of the innovations and businesses that were being developed in america around the cannabis space and it became quite clear that this would become a global phenomenon and in 2015 i decided to start getting up to date with how cannabis can be used as a therapeutic agent and from there one thing led to another and i in 2016 launched budding tech which at the time was the first cannabis consultancy firm in australia uh and through that vehicle i was fortunate enough to work on a variety of different projects um academic uh medical import export related uh if you can name it it's very likely that i've done it in the last five years so that's the that's the the timing piece and in regards to the why uh my mother has been quite ill she's suffered from a mental health disorder for probably since i was a child and it through some research that i was um reviewing i had found that my mother's particular indication could be potentially treated by cannabis and that's kind of where the personal motivation came in ensuring that this medical treatment could be available for my mother and people like my mother and that was really the the why that propelled my my interest in the space that's that's how i got involved and that's why i got involved i also believe the therapeutic potential of this plant is enormous and it's uh very much uh timely that we're at a position in society where cannabis and other medical um other medicines are now finally being looked at and received more favorably than they have been in the past both through public and through the medical communities great and given that you've got such a extensive experience and knowledge around the medicinal cannabis space you know if you were to take sort of a bird's eye view about how this industry has evolved over time um and sort of project that forward you know five to ten years you know where do you see our industry going and how you know how big uh is this is this um gonna play out yeah good good question so there's two avenues that the cannabis industry is going to very likely take we'll focus on on medicine and we'll then focus on health and wellness so from a medical uh from the medical side of things in the next five to ten years it's very likely that you will see a number of cannabis medicines registered on the aitg meaning that they will have undergone full phased clinical trials um and have gone through the relevant um application processes to be accepted as medical treatments for various indications and the likely indication areas will be related to epilepsy multiple sclerosis and various pain indications as well as mental health i i think that there's going to be a lot of um a lot of development in the mental health space using cbd in particular as a potential agent to treat various mental health conditions um that's one layer of how the industry will evolve and then the specifics around how cannabis is developed as a medicine will evolve so a little bit about the plant there are more than 700 compounds present in the plant all of which have their own effects and what researchers are now currently trying to understand is what is it about the cannabis plants specifically what what actives are leading to the net effect for patients and it's a very complex challenge to to answer because there are so many variables and this is something that um most people would be familiar with and if you're not i'll explain briefly the entourage effect the synergistic effect of the cannabis plant how each of these molecules interact with one another and whether or not removing something negates the effect of the plant so there's a researcher in israel who i spoke with last week his name is professor daddy miri he is one of the world's most renowned cannabis researchers in my professional opinion what he's trying to do is understand what is the entourage effect so he and his research team over the last three years have been analyzing cannabis samples from the eight licensed growers in israel and looking at what the actual chemo are or the chemical makeup of the plant what it consists of and then running those those data points in both in vitro and in vivo studies as well as that receiving live qualitative data from patients with those same products that they're using and over time he's building a database to eventually understand what are the common cannabinoids the active parts of the plant what are the common cannabinoids that are present in in cannabis that treat pain indications that treat um spasticity that treat inflammation etc so he had mentioned to me that he's identified for treatment of autism that they have specified three cannabinoids which they can use to treat autism which is as a doctor i'm sure you can appreciate very encouraging because it means that you can say with certainty these are the actives that are treating my patient these are the ingredients uh and that's really where i see the future of cannabis evolving as a medicines specific formulations for patients now we're very very far away from that reality because the the the double-edged sword of cannabis is that it can treat a wide range of indications but it also means the focus of companies is very far and wide so rather than focusing on one specific indication you've got companies focusing a large variety and as i'm sure you can appreciate a clinical trial takes um you know can take a decade so there's a lot more um research to be conducted in the specifics on how cannabis um or cannabinoids can be used to treat um various indications i see the industry evolving in a more scientifically focused direction that's one area in the next five ten years the other area is the health and wellness space so this is where if you look towards the us or the uk um canada to a lesser extent in other parts of europe cbd has been um [Music] has been very well received to put it lightly so in the uk for example about four years ago there were roughly 200 000 regi 200 000 users of cbd um and in the last year there have been more than a million people in the uk that have tried um some sort of cbd product why because it's being touted as a new health and wellness product that can um treat or be used for a variety of different purposes now the challenge around this is there's not a lot of quality data that supports the use of you know small to moderate amounts of cbd to treat or to be used for health and wellness but it has been rapidly accepted by consumers and it's very likely in the next year or so in australia and over the next coming in the coming years you'll see a more a faster momentum of the adoptance the adopting of cbd products in the health and wellness space vitamin supplements otc etc in fact the department of health um very recently released um its position or potential position around the rescheduling of cbd from s4 to s3 meaning that it would be treated as an over-the-counter product that can be sold to by a pharmacist so i think in the next 10 years 5-10 years the adoptance of cbd products will become mainstream across the globe and you'll see a completely new market of products such as curcumin and cbd or melatonin and cbd a wide variety of different combination formulations for health and wellness consumers using the cbd ingredient i i would say that's very likely to happen over the next few years so that's my that's my kind of two main predictions and that's specific to the medical that's specific to the cannabis application as a medicine or a wellness product you'll also see evolutions in the way that cannabis is grown the way that technologies are leveraged to understand how cannabis is consumed the whole space will evolve um as well but those are the two pivotal areas that i see the industry um gearing towards greater such a fantastic answer there's a lot a lot of information about unpacking it that's very very useful thank you um which part of the medicinal cannabis industry you see is the most exciting at this you know for yourself or for um um people like me who's got you know a little bit of entrepreneurial um aspirations and things like that and people who may want to get into the medicine cannabis industry like where do you see other the you know biggest plays um for for the market moving forward okay well i it depends on where you sit what your skill sets are and how much capital you have what excites me most is what i mentioned the before about the research that's coming out of israel identifying and understanding what cannabinoids separately and in combination with one another equal an outcome i find that to be absolutely fascinating because it really sheds light on how cannabis works as a medicine and i think that is an absolute essential for this industry to evolve so that's where i see that's what excites me most if it were me and i was about to enter the space and someone and i was asking for advice where would i invest my time effort and energy well i i do anticipate that there will be i anticipate that in us if we're focusing solely on australia i think that there's going to be an opportunity for companies to develop strategies around generating revenue with regards to that s3 piece that i mentioned before the cbd being rescheduled to s3 i think that will open up a lot of opportunity companies in this space that currently exist if they've got access to distribution channels uh in pharmacy but what i really see is the kind of the next main kind of players in the space would be vitamin and supplement companies that are already selling into pharmacy it's very likely that they'll start incorporating cbd into their product ranges so if you go to chemist warehouse in about two years time i would imagine that most of those companies will have created a cbd range of products now i say that with a grain of salt because we don't know what the regulations are going to look like just yet the the recently as i mentioned the the department of health have put forward their position there have been a number of submissions from companies that were finished late last week on friday the the tga requested submissions from the industry and people to put forward their ideas around the new amendments for cbd um so i imagine that from an opportunity perspective that presents the greatest opportunities for existing companies for groups that aren't involved in the space i think the lowest kind of hanging fruit if it were me would be looking at something like what the cannabis company have done the cannabis co they're a hemp um very hump consumer brand they have three hemp gins they have a number of hemp seed products and what they've done is try to build a brand around hemp and i think that's the lowest hanging fruit because it allows companies to generate revenue in the short term and focus on longer term objectives so that same company also has an arm called herbicare which is a medical cannabis company which they use to sell cannabis products into australia which are imported from overseas from switzerland so that's a good example of a company that has a diverse revenue strategy and is capitalizing on the brand building aspects of the hemp space and also on the side building a medical cannabis business and both of which are connected to one another so that's that's where i would encourage companies to look at investing in brand development building a brand whether that be in the medical or in the hemp wellness space nice nice um how do you you know yeah as you're aware there's some some big names currently um working in australia and getting a lot of their products um imported from overseas especially canada how do you see the the market um in australia evolving from from um from products um from the product perspective you know are we gonna see a lot more production in australia and if so why why have we not started seeing that um more mainstream at the moment yeah so it's a good question the the reason why we see products coming in from overseas primarily is because we have there's a limited number of companies that can legally produce cannabis here in australia about a handful to be specific uh and that's because the the there's a lot of there's a number of reasons but the the main reason why we haven't seen a lot of activity in australia is because the tga um and odc um mainly the odc were inundated with license applications that the forecast um of what they thought would be um you know submitted from an interest perspective for licenses was um grossly underestimated um hundreds of licensed applications were submitted and that takes time to sift through so from a resourcing perspective the odc didn't have the relevant resources to go through these applications and as a result there are still companies that have been in the application process now for more than two and a half years they're still waiting for their licenses so that's why we don't have the local product available but companies like many farm labs the group that i work with little green pharma and and antg as an example do have licenses and permits to um produce product here locally and that's going to start to increase over the next year and as a result of that increase so to the amount of product that's available locally now what that means for the the for patients is still a question mark um from a price perspective specifically because i would imagine that the costing of the products here in australia will be i'm pretty much on par with what patients are currently paying for um out of canada um and but the greatest benefit that i think will come to australian patients through the um through the through the onboarding of more cultivation and manufacturing groups will be the accessibility of products in a more timely fashion so having products locally versus going through what might look like a 10 to 12 week timeline approval process from an import export perspective and the costing associated to importing into australia a lot of that's going to be mitigated by having local production um that will bring down costs in certain respects but you've also got to consider that a lot of these companies are in deep from a finance perspective setting up a facility is not cheap and costs need to be recovered so how that's going to affect the patient population from a pricing perspective i'm still not 100 sold on what that's going to look like so i wish i could give you a more definitive answer but i do imagine that there will be there will be more product available for patients in a tick a quicker time frame and perhaps at a more competitive cost that's that's what i anticipate will come out of out of this but a question to you david as a as a doctor that's prescribing cannabis what are what are your thoughts about having local product as a doctor knowing that you've got a product here locally made by an australian company versus something that's coming in from australia how do does that would you prioritize that product over an importer product is it more about cost for you what what are the factors that you consider when prescribing to your patients yeah good question um a lot of it a lot of the weight at the moment is um price-based because it's uh a lot of our patients are price sensitive um and because this medication is uh unregistered uh and unsubsidized by the government we you know we you know the cost eventually falls onto the patient and you know they're spending on average 150 to 300 a month on this on medicine cannabis so it's that's anything to save them costs in the long run is is very very useful um and saying that a lot of patients are asking whether the products are made in australia because um there is a there's certainly a preference for australian made um and you know i would you know prefer to use australian made if i could um but you know i think the the the biggest part of it is it's cost um for the patient at the moment making them a decision on um uh on what product to use so it's cost there's also issues with you know um making sure you use a good reputable brand something that's well recognized in the industry um and and you know making sure they're all you know they've got the right certifications of gmp um certifications and that sort of thing so but i would say most of the decision making is probably around um cost the quality of the product the brand itself and make sure that there's a good steady supply chain um making sure we don't run out of products for patients because um they'll be really that's caused us a bit of frustration in the past when we haven't been able to access a product for a patient um when they've been honored and doing really well with it um but you can't access it for a couple of months and you have to switch them over it's a bit of a headache for everyone involved so yeah supply chain um cost branding that that's probably the big big three ending um the fourth one will probably be um made in australia i think i you know we would love we would love for more manufacturing to occur in australia because i'm you know a lot of patients prefer that way but for now yeah we're a bit you know um stuck for choice in terms of [Music] um the feeling that you're getting in the space i'd say so i'm i'm i'm particularly interested about patient drop-off rates and why patients drop off from using their medicine and that that's what fascinates me because there's an element of it that plays uh to the cost the ability to access the product so supply chain issues are quite foreign i would imagine to a patient that's accessing a medicine that's you know helping alleviating their suffering and then not having that and then having to switch from another product to another product especially considering how relatively unconventional this this this medicine is at this stage based on you know the 80 years of stigma and prohibition etc so i i i would imagine that once local market is established and it's business as per usual i'd imagine that will have a net effect with patients um when providing confidence knowing that there's an australian made medicine it's available whenever they need it their doctor trusts it and i think that will add tremendous weight to to both companies doctors and patients agreed agreed um you did mention something uh about what you were working on currently uh which is meta farm i was hoping you could you know tell the audience a little bit about what you're working on at the moment and uh and yeah that that side of the production um aspect of things yeah yeah with pleasure so so i work with medifarm labs for for the audience medifarm labs is a australian and canadian based cannabis manufacturing company that specializes in cannabinoid extraction and cannabis finished products so the company takes the raw ingredients they purchase it from suppliers they don't cultivate themselves they then extract the active materials and they put them into finished dosed format all under pharmaceutical grade gmp so that is a high level overview of the company what that means that particular part around au gmp is that the products that medifarm produces can be exported practically across the globe without bogging down on details for gmp it's a it's a manufacturing standard good manufacturing process i should say um that's used across all industries but in particular for the pharmaceutical industry it's a it's a process that ensures that products consistently are provided um batch after batch in the same way and that any type of um recall potential is mitigated as a risk because the worst thing that you that could happen is something goes wrong with a patient so it's a process to to mitigate risk in the manufacturing sense um what i do with many farm labs as head of strategic bounce is build relationships with companies with research organizations with patients and understand how we as an organization can add value to companies and people whether that be providing a company with a finished product under their own brand that they can sell to to and and provide to patients or building relationships with academic research institutes to understand how cannabinoid therapies can be tested in trials and providing that api or the active materials to those researchers to to investigate and conduct trials on my role is to assess opportunities and understand how to bridge gaps between opportunities to ensure a successful outcome for all parties involved so it's a fancy way of saying build good quality relationships and see what is the best outcome that can be achieved for all parties involved so that's what i do with medifarm and that's a brief overview about medifarm labs and the facilities uh for medifarm is based in victoria and i'm very proud to say that the company was awarded its uh gmp and its uh ability to manufacture from the tga about two weeks ago so as of june uh next month the company will be selling finished product from its facility you see this is a retreat moving forward for um other countries uh to have similar type of facilities i mean i anticipate that there will be a trend but if you uh having the the idea to develop a cannabis manufacturing facility and actually understanding the implications of building a facility are very very far apart if if a company is going to engage in or intent to build a manufacturing facility good luck you're in for a minimum of a three year journey to get this thing from idea to completion because building that facility and attaining that gmp is no simple task it takes years and a lot of investment from a financial perspective and from a human capital perspective it takes a lot of people to build this and um ask the ceo of many farm warren everett likes to joke that when he started this project he had a full set of hair and now he's bold so it's it kind of echoes the the position around the difficulty of building a whether it's a cultivation facility to genera to build to to develop the materials that go into the finished product or the manufacturing facility building a pharmaceutical facility is not easy it takes time a lot of effort and energy and is not for the for the faint of heart so i anticipate there will be a trend around the world but whether those trends are executed on um is another story fair enough um given like there's such a big demand for patients accessing uh medicinal cannabis um you know like we we you and i both understand that the demand is quite um quite dramatic at the moment um and but but there is definitely a shortage of supply of patients being able to access it through their doctors or um getting subscribers to to prescribe the patients um do you see this as a significant barrier at the moment for patients um using it or do you feel like you know supply is being is currently meeting demand well i i definitely think that if you look back about two years ago 2018 um there was a very there were a few important events that occurred that year that has led to the increase of access the increase of accessibility of cannabis products in australia the first piece is around the tga's updating of their website to allow for a streamlined application to be to be submitted so minimizing the amount of effort and energy that doctors needed to expend on submitting an application and putting it all into an online form that accounts for both the state and federal requirements was a very important point the other point was the opening of clinics like yours clinics are the absolute essential piece for this industry to evolve in my opinion because although there's a plethora of doctors that may be interested in cannabis and i say maybe as as an emphasis point there's still degrees of separation between a doctor that might be interested and a doctor that can competently and that is capable of prescribing a medicinal cannabis product most doctors are relatively unfamiliar with the prescribing model prescribing pathways for cannabis the special access skin category b to be particular and most doctors have never prescribed cannabis before they don't know how to dose the product they don't know how to indicate how the patient should increase their dosage over time or better known as titrate and these are variables or considerations that had initially led to the very slow movement and growth in the space and then once these clinics opened up you have dedicated doctors that have spent time educating themselves on how cannabis can be prescribed how to dose how to titrate and how to provide comfort to their patients that this is something that they're how to provide comfort and confidence to their patients because if a doctor doesn't understand what cannabis is how it works what the endocannabinoid system is then it's very likely that the patient either will not be prescribed in the first place or they won't receive the confidence that they need to shift from their existing medications to to medical cannabis which again after 80 years of prohibition it takes a lot of effort and energy to kind of build up the courage to even go ask your doctor so i think that that clinic model that has been developed is an essential for the industry to grow what i think can be done better and what i think can encourage momentum to continue in the direction that it's going in this more education more events like this kudos to you for putting on a webinar series and broadening your audience and and i think that's absolutely essential the other kind of key point that i think is going to have a massive set of implications is the introduction of um medicare rebates to telehealth so at the beginning of the covet crisis the the government had announced that they would allow for rebates um on telehealth and i think that patients will start to move towards telehealth and so will doctors and i think there's huge implications for that because if you can imagine from a doctor's perspective i mean for you you know you you want to see as many patients as you can but there are so many hours in the day and prescribing cannabis is not a um a simple process as such so being able to see patients from the comfort of their own home i think will allow doctors to give more time to their patients and it will also give patients the comfort for trying out cannabis products um in a more seamless way because they don't feel the necessity to go to the doctor and that has huge implications on rural communities who don't have access to doctors that know anything about cannabis so i think um if you look at the numbers for the for the last few months around uh prescription numbers in australia they haven't decreased they've they've actually they've increased they've slightly declined but they've maintained it around 3000 prescriptions per month which is significant and i anticipate that's going to keep increasing after covid finishes but as as a result of the telehealth the introduction of telehealth i really think that more patients will start to not only see their doctors via video conference but i think that will give more patients access to doctors that could prescribe cannabis because like yourself i'm i'm sure that you're now seeing all your patients via telehealth is that is that is that a fair assumption yeah absolutely yeah because of the covert thing we've we've had to change the business model a little bit and just just do all our whole consultations via video or telephone um and it's worked reasonably well i mean although you know we still prefer to see patients face to face um this is a fairly sort of simple um way to consult with patients and a lot of patients appreciate the fact that they don't have to come all the way into clinic to do that and um it's a time saver and um it's far more convenient for people so yeah absolutely we've moved to italy health for the last couple of months now it's working well um you know our numbers are expanding um and yeah we're happy with the way it's going but you know it does it certainly doesn't beat um consulting patients um face to face you know there are certain things you can you can do in terms of like clinical examinations that you couldn't do um over the phone so um yeah but that definitely is a modality that that is going to be you know used a lot more moving forward i think um and how do you see that like what do you see the implications of telehealth being on on your clinic and and patients uh slash doctors and patients with specific uh reference to cannabis how do you see this impact in the industry i think it's only going to be a good thing for the industry um the the fantastic thing about consulting and medicine canvas is that you generally don't really need to do too much in the way of a physical examination or or um you know almost all of the console can be done over the phone or you know you know by video uh consult and um because most of us it's education it's about you know telling the patient you know how to dose how you know how to titrate side effects you know interactions with their medications um we're not really here to diagnose the patient i mean the diagnosis should have come from the gp or the specialist already and you know we get a referral from them from their specialist or their gp um before we see them anyway so that you know all the all the question marks around diagnosis and um you know investigations and stuff have already been pre-handled so we are really just there to be that conduit to helping people access the the medication itself and apply for the permits for the patients of the uh if they're suitable candidates um and provide you know good education good um uh um you know reassurance for the patient how to use this stuff yeah so so telehealth is a perfect platform for us at this stage um yeah it makes sense i i've been saying for years that what i think will carry this industry into its next stage of development is as i mentioned the clinics but also the adoption the adopting of telehealth services i really think that's a game changer for the space and the fact that patients can now claim that back is um is absolutely significant absolutely agreed agreed um i just wanted to mention to the audience that i forgot to flag this earlier but we do have a chat box um and if you guys are uh if anyone's got any questions um feel free to type in any questions in here and we need to do a bit of a um you know uh opening up to the audience q a session towards the end of the webinar later we'll get around to all those questions later if you guys have um anything you want to type in there okay and going back to sort of roadblocks or barriers to helping patients access do you see any other major impediments in the way for patients accessing um these medications i think it's going to become easier over time i don't think that i think i think the main roadblocks have been addressed or at least most of the main roadblocks i think that the the red tape around the accessibility of the products from from a prescribing perspective have been somewhat mitigated uh i would um a lot of a lot of the roadblocks really exist on the on the organizational side the actual technicals around getting the relevant licenses to um wholesale a store and also these medicines aren't um aren't uh easy and as mentioned before the time lag that it's taken for companies to apply for the license receive the license set up the facility and get their permits and grow the medicine is that one of the biggest roadblocks so i think that the main issues that are preventing um affordable access for patients are are slowly but surely being mitigated um and again as i mentioned with this telehealth piece who would have thought covid19 would happen and that we would have um the government rebating um telehealth this didn't exist a year ago so the i i really think it's going to become easier as time passes it will become more accepted and as australian companies come online you'll see more news pieces and media pieces of these companies and that will reach audiences and be shared on social media and those all have net effects that will eventually lead to you know the the complete adoption of cannabis as a as a treatment option not as a last line treatment perhaps as a first line treatment that's that's really what i see this uh leaning towards over time this will be recognized as a first-line treatment that's very very exciting times of it isn't it um do you do you see uh new zealand uh obviously new zealand's gonna have a referendum in september do you see them legislating the uh the recreational use of medicinal cannabis and do you think australia might follow down that pathway at some stage well new zealand's a really interesting case study because new zealand have gone at this as a in a much more liberal or less conservative fashion first off from from date dot cbd has been accessible to patients via doctor prescription without any type of oversight from the ministry of health so if a patient wants to access cbd in australia the tga needs to approve or authorize the prescribing of that product from by the doctor via that special access scheme category b pathway so new zealand doesn't have that if a doctor wants to prescribe cbd they can prescribe cbd um on april 1st their regulations were amended to also include thc so now in new zealand a patient can be prescribed thc or cbd by a doctor prescription without any oversight from the government without any approval process so from a medical perspective already new zealand is ahead of the curve when it comes to accessibility and and back to your previous question from a roadblock perspective what will really open up this space for patients is if the tga allows for doctors to prescribe at their own discretion without any approval processes in place that's what will change the industry overnight i really hope the industry goes in that direction and the tga looks at new zealand and and learns a few lessons and hopefully decides to implement a similar model around the prescribing of cannabis and the accessibility of cannabis it's still equally as strict from a from a compliance perspective gmp needs to be adhered to you need to have specific licenses to wholesale and to store etc i don't think any of that should change but the ability for doctors to make their own decision to prescribe without approval from the tga is essential regarding the referendum and the recreational market it's i don't know whether that will pass um if it does pass it will have significant implications um in new zealand of course allowing for a recreational market um whether or not australia follows in pursuit is still a question mark they haven't followed in pursuit on the um prescription of the ability to prescribe cbd and thc like new zealand so i don't know if it will have that much of an effect but i do think it's a very interesting proposition what new zealand is doing and i i find the recreational market incredibly fascinating i i am an advocate for drug reform when it comes to kind of priorities i think the priorities to get medical right first um let's ensure that patients have access to safe reliable consistent medicines um versus opening up a recreational market because what might happen is you might the patients migrate to the recreational market and all of this ability to gather valuable data on how cannabis can be used as a medicine instantly evaporates so you don't want that to happen you want to make sure patients have access so i like what new zealand has done they've implemented a system where patients can access cannabis quickly and effectively and then they'll introduce recreational if it's approved by um if it's if it's voted in by the people which i think is a very appropriate decision i i think uh i support that but i also really emphasize get medical right before you introduce a recreational market right great answer um all right i wanted to move into sort of a little bit into the future of the medieval cannabis space some there's obviously been some good innovations coming up uh in the space but what out of what are the best innovations that you've seen so far and what's what's become what what excites you most about sort of um uh you know what that are coming along or that you'd like to see come along well it goes it goes back to the same point that i started with with the research out of israel um defined cannabinoid therapies actually understanding what medicine you're getting not only from a consistent perspective consistency perspective but understanding that this product contains this thc this much cbd this much cbn and these terpenes as an example um the more sophisticated we become with cannabinoid um formulations the the better it is for doctors when they want to know what am i actually prescribing so my the excitement always comes back down to medicine develop developing medicines um next to that stands the innovation in delivery formats right now in the australian space they're primarily uh the the product space is primarily um dominated by oils just like soft uh sublinguals um there are a handful of flower products there's even a smaller handful of sublingual or or softgel products and then there's a few outlier products like sprays and wafers that you can put under the tongue for sublingual absorption or buccal cavity absorption um i think that there's going to be a lot of innovation in the delivery format spray space whether that be specific vaporizer or nebulizer devices that you can inhale um and have a standardized dose um that that's an inner interesting area standardized dosing is another and bioavailability is another interesting area so ensuring that what you get consistently is the same dose and and ensuring that the what you consume is actually that most of it's absorbed in in um in the body because unfortunately cannabis doesn't have a strong bioavailability profile meaning that most of the product or most of the material is destroyed before it's absorbed into your bloodstream so companies will be working on nano delivery technologies or water-soluble technologies to ensure that the medicine is is absorbed or and and you have a an efficacious dose without requiring a high amount of material because one of the the issues that patients face is that they need to increase their dose quite frequently which increases the cost for patients over time so figuring out how to minimize dose but achieve the same outcome as as you would with a higher amount of material is exciting and another area is in the uh agriculture space companies that are developing unique strains that are not just thc and cbd so there's more than 140 cannabinoids present in the cannabis plant and we've only scratched the surface thc and cbd are just the beginning you'll start to see a lot more interest in cbg which is a precursor to thc in cbd um from a cabinet perspective it's kind of like the the grand father of cannabinoids it's the it's the first cannabinoid at the top of the chain um so you'll see uh products that are developed uh from minor cannabinoids so thc cbd the primary one cbg is um the next cab off the rank there's some interest in in thcv and the acid formats of of cannabinoids so thc a um so to kind of like summarize what i just said in a in a simpler fashion i what i'm excited to see is cultivators developing strains with higher amounts of cannabinoids that are not thc and cbd but other cannabinoids and seeing how those products are prioritized and and and what are the results from a research perspective for the medical application of those products so that's those are the areas that i'm quite excited to see unfold over the coming years awesome awesome i would love to see that they're happening as well myself um okay uh and i wanted to just highlight to the audience um that kevin and i are quite avid readers of your um weekly newsletter that you send out um uh thank you i was hoping you could maybe just just run through that a little bit and and because you you give some very very good informative information articles and summaries about uh the new developments in medicinal cannabis but you also go through a little bit about psychedelic medicine as well do you want to just give the audience a little bit of a heads up about that yeah yeah with pleasure thank you for referencing that uh so yeah for the last 115 weeks which is more than two years i've been doing a mailing list every sunday night i've put it together myself i read through about 100 articles a week about cannabis and psychedelic medicines and i categorize that based on whether it's a business article or if it's related to policy or regulation changes or medical or scientific innovations i categorize them and i put that into a digestible format that readers can get a very high level glimpse of what's going on in the cannabis and psychedelic space and that's a free mailing list every sunday it comes out consistently at about 6 45 p.m and it's a summary of interesting insights and facts that i've come across for the week plus article links um for for anyone who's interested to actually read the full article so if you're if you wanna i i often jokingly say if you wanna do what i do and and be as knowledgeable as i am in the cannabis space just read my newsletter because that's what i do i just those are the articles that inform my thinking regarding how the space is emerging and it's evolving etc so that's um so that's been a passion project of mine and with regards to psychedelics i i the therapeutic application of psychedelics in the mental health space is unlike anything that i think this generation is has seen um i am a wholehearted believer that psychedelic medicines offer treatment for mental health disorders in a way that um that um yeah that other medicines on the market i don't believe have the ability to to achieve now that's a huge statement there needs to be more research of course but in the last few years the fda as an example granted breakthrough status to both mdma which is better known as ecstasy and psilocybin which is the active ingredient in in mushrooms magic mushrooms to be specific um and that means that the fda granting breakthrough status allows researchers to more seamlessly and simply conduct research in this space you're going to see the psychedelic space explode just like the cannabis space did in the last decade but with a very specific focus on mental health and that's a personal passion of mine again coming back to my mother um i really believe these interventions um are very useful and can save lives so that's that's a little bit about the psychedelic space but it's a very much a passion point of view yeah i'm i'm not um hugely sort of knowledgeable about the psychedelic space but i assume from what i've read it's um it's a very very exciting modality of treatment for um like you're saying a lot of mental health issues illnesses so yeah i'm very you know i'm super excited for for that space to take off um down the track in the near future hopefully as well um yeah it will take off soon vincent is already conducting clinical trials using psilocybin maps which is an organization in america uh which has been running for about 30 years now in the process of recruiting for their phase three clinical trials using mdma for ptsd this is absolutely astounding if so for the audience a clinical trial process has four stages to it once you get past stage three your medicine can be sold across the globe and can be listed on the artg as an example so it's very likely in the next um three years or so mdma will be uh prescribable for patients with ptsd um and it will also be prescribed perhaps off label which is also exciting for the other areas that it might cover so it's a it's an absolutely fascinating space that more people should pay attention to for sure absolutely um and would you be okay if we um perhaps get kevin to post up the the the way to access your newsletter on the chat yeah of course there's no um to my discredit there's no website that anyone can sign up it's a simple email to my inbox and i'll sign you up myself i need to uh to start systemizing that in a way where i spend less time on it but but it's a simple send me an email address and i'll add you myself okay um perhaps we could post your email address for the audience of course um all right uh now i always i'm always really excited to learn about new sort of up-and-coming trends that are likely to be sort of you know decade-long movements in in the medical field and um so that's why little one of the the reasons i really wanted to get into the middle canvas space um but you know i i i really enjoy um uh looking into uh other investment um arenas and you know um artificial intelligence is one of those ones that sort of um has been on on the radar for me for a while now um but i've never been able to find a way of sort of you know investigating it further or even sort of you know investing in anything that that has um the immense potential that ai can bring um how do you see you know do you see ai being able to be um helpful than involving the medicinal cannabis space yeah definitely i think ai is going to evolve the medical space in general in most industries in fact all industries but specific reference to to cannabis so again i i've referenced daddy mary's work several times um but i find it fascinating and it's an excellent example of a real world application for how this is being implemented today so in dede's lab as i mentioned they are accumulating a lot of data around you know what the cannabinoid profile looks like from a cannabinoid and a terpenoid and a flavonoid perspective looking at all of the elements that make up the plant looking at how these cannabinoid strains are used in various uh research models whether that's in vivo or vitro and understanding how these cannabinoid strains can target specific indications in in petri dishes and in living cells and organisms um all the way up to how patients are using um those cannabis strains so daddy has a an app that patients have access to and they report in on a day-to-day basis what they're taking how they're taking it if they're having adverse effects and over time these results will be analyzed and this is where ai comes in it's a very big term but it's effectively uh machine processing abilities to learn and to develop insights more quickly and effectively than what we can do as humans so over time what you're going to see or what i imagine for cannabis is that you've got this big question what is the entourage effect and how does it work and eventually there'll be enough data points available where you've got an algorithm that can be built to analyze this information mass amounts of data and start to pinpoint where there are commonalities in patient treatments and cannabinoid strains so eventually over time you'll be able to identify what other cannabinoids that are most commonly effective in treating specific indications um and that's a that has huge implications for the cannabis industry at large once that data is accessible and available so i see ai playing a role in helping patients and doctors and companies understand what's actually leading to the effect of the medicine but also on a simpler uh or even in another real world application or example where there are companies in the states in canada that use dna testing to understand where patients are likely to benefit from cannabis use so they'll take your dna they'll look at what indications you're you're you might be prone to and they'll proce and they'll and they'll recommend cannabis strains that could be used to treat those indications now this is a bit kind of borderlining pseudoscience because you still need to understand that although you might have a cannabis strain that has let's say beta-caryophyllene which is used effectively to treat pain it's a great terpene in conjunction with thc which is analgesic uh but it's used in combination as an effective it could be used in combination i should say as an effective trainer a pain uh relief product now just because someone um is prone to certain pain conditions doesn't mean that a cannabis strain with those two components in it will work because there are other variables but but what these companies are trying to do is bridge the gap between your genetic data and how cannabis could be used to support um you know your your life your your potential um pain uh or if someone is prone to alzheimer's they might recommend a strain that has um let's say pinene which has been shown to have um effects on on memory loss um positive effects on memory loss so people can start to tailor cannabis products specifically to patients based on their potential or current indications so that's where i see ai playing a significant role in cannabis in the medical application but then even on a lesson on a small scale or around the growing application of cannabis using data to understand the efficiencies how you can gain a a more output from from having less input and looking at how to optimize your lighting systems and your growth cycles and how much water or nutrients that you're using and analyzing those those results over time that's where artificial intelligence is going to play a huge huge role in cannabis and generally across all industries because it will help people understand how to leverage data in a way to achieve outcomes that's a very non-technical answer but that's how i see um cannabis and ai um interacting with one another absolutely i think it is going to be a huge paradigm shift once we get involved in analyzing the data and such and such tips um and before we get into the audience questions i wanted to ask you one more question from my own sort of um it's not interesting a lot of patients ask me about um investing in the industry itself um and you know we we often end up chatting for quite a while about uh stocks and and stock market plays and things like that now we've noticed that you know cannabis uh companies have gone through a bit of a downturn recently uh we've had in the last few years we had a massive boom cycle and now we're into the fast cycle of it um and there's been a massive slowdown and and financing um aspects of cannabis companies um can you you know in your expert opinion can you can you give us a little bit of um insight as to where you see us heading and first of all how that's why that's occurred and where the market's getting yeah um i'm not i'm not a an advisor stock advisor is an fyi this is just my perspective um it's like any major industry that like you can look at blockchain as an example or the the dot-com bubble uh there's a bubble there's a lot of interest uh there were some huge company evaluations that came out of canada that really excited investors and excited the industry for the potential of what this industry could look like also there was over time an escalating market value that increased year on year because of the potential therapeutic application of cannabis um it can be used to treat there is evidence that can show that shows that it can be used to treat a variety of indication that's still the meat on the bone still needs to be kind of carved off on that one and we need solid data to understand how cannabis works but the excitement of a potential industry with so many touch points from both a medical and a recreational market led to an excited investor base now a lot of companies launched made some announcements purchased some com purchased some assets in different company countries and expected that cannabis would be legislated across the world in a way where you know markets are accessible but that's not the case it's moved really slowly um look at the uk for example which has had cannabis regulations in place since 2019. there are less than you know there's a there's a less than a a few hundred patients that have gained access to cannabis in that time frame very slow uptake because of the fact that we are dealing with something that was prohibited for almost 100 years so as a result of this the hype eventually transitioned into the question around where's the revenue where are the profits and how is this company growing and because not a lot of companies are demonstrating that value at this stage they're not they haven't demonstrated a significant what i call product market fit which is moving from startup phase to um you know operational phase where you're actually generating meaningful income not many companies have successfully been able to do that yet as yet and eventually the bubble starts to to burst because you've got more companies coming in raising capitals and that's at the bottom of the funnel and at the top of the funnel where there are companies that are mature they're not generating meaningful or healthy profits and eventually investors start to ask the question well what when are these companies going to be able to commercialize and when are these companies going to be able to return to return some value on my investment and because there haven't been many companies that have been able to sexually do that um investors have lost confidence as well as that we're going through a corona crisis that's likely to put the world into some sort of financial crisis unlike unlike anything it's seen before um and that causes people to pull back on their investments and one of the first investments that will go will be these kind of like hot pot stocks because there's there was a lot of hype the hype has boiled down now and because there hasn't been meaningful returns a lot of these investors are pulling out so i think that the the downturn has been largely due to the fact that you've got a lot of companies coming in and at the top of the the the chain of companies not a lot of these companies are generating meaningful return on their investments and this can be seen in the fact that canopy and other companies have been selling out of their assets internationally they've been letting go of staff because money isn't freely available it's harder to raise capital these days and investors want to see um some profits come in now to ensure that the business has is viable so that's why that's that's my assessment on why the markets kind of had a downturn but and why you had such um such interest at the start i mean there was a stat that i read about two years ago in america that the cannabis company cannabis was growing from a from a company's perspective and an industry perspective faster than the internet was growing in the early 2000s during the duck home this is significant um also in denver colorado there are more dispensaries than there are starbucks um outlets which if anyone has been to america and knows how many starbucks outlets there are you'd be astounded you've basically got a starbucks in every corner so those height pieces encouraged a lot of early buy-in and now they're com investors are wanting to see more than just um a press release around you know a potential agreement that isn't definitive great thank you for that um now i'd like to move on to the audience questions you wouldn't mind um so first and foremost we got a question from jason who asks what kind of symptoms can medicinal cannabis help with in spinal patients um do you do you have a view on that would you want me to take that you're the doctor you're the good doctor i think you should answer that question okay sure um well jason um we have seen uh quite a few number of patients with um spinal cord injuries in our clinic and these patients often who suffer a lot of chronic pain um predominantly neuropathic type pain so so nerve related pain which could be you know burning um you know stinging good it could be electricity sort of shooting through to um through your body type of pains and um and occasionally some phantom pain as well so uh we found that medicinal cannabis is actually very very useful in this cohort of patients particularly products that contain thcs we find thc to be extremely good for neuropathic type pain and damping down the pain signals and but it also reduces the distress around the pain itself so what we often find is you know um people will say you know it may not reduce all of my pain but it certainly reduces the pain enough that i can you um get on with my life or you know tolerate the pain a lot easier and so it's about improving the pain signaling mechanism but also reducing the distress that people feel around the pain and we often find patients with spinal cord injuries have a lot of muscle spasms and and they can be extremely painful as well when they come on uh tsg and to some extensivity can help with reducing muscle spasticity so it's um uh combination therapies like cbd and thc um oils or um you know sprays and things that um uh in use and other conditions that that have uh contain a lot of spasticity um as epidomic symptoms like multiple sclerosis so yeah so so tfc and cbd to some extent will be good for pain um and spasticity and [Music] neuropathic type pains as well cool so that's that question another question is um adam will medicinal cannabis be likely to come onto the pbs coming on to the years in due course yes not uh not this year unfortunately i don't know if the tga is going to um allow for products to come on the pbs that haven't gone through um clinical trials it's a question that's still unknown a lot of advocates are fighting for that um to happen that cannabis medicines are put on the pbs um it's it's still an unknown uh it's really at the hands of the tga i hope it does that would be very helpful and that's one of those um those pieces that will accelerate the adoption of cannabis products but yeah the tga is a slow moving conservative beast and another question is adam is there an expected date for cbd uh to be rescheduled in australia uh i imagine that will happen in early 20 in early 2021 is when the when that will be rescheduled i don't think it will happen this year but the industry submissions were only put through last week so again considering how slow the tga moves i would imagine that this is likely to happen in q1 or q2 of 2021 okay another question for you and then are doctors currently interested in the therapeutic effect of other cannabinoids such as cbc and cbg and also two opinions well i'm not sure about their interest in cbc and cbg although those are interesting cannabinoids uh there's definitely and david you'll be able to answer this as well but there's definitely interest in terpenes i've seen the last six to 12 months an interest increase in the therapeutic applications of terpenes and how terpenes can be combined with cannabinoid therapies um i think that's a very interesting area and i'm personally interested in this because there is quite a wealth of data on the therapeutic application of terpenes because they're not exclusive to cannabinoids terpenes are found throughout nature so i do see more doctor interest in terpenes what about you david have you seen um an interest or what's your personal interest do you do you have um um thoughts on on the prescribing or the the the utility of terpenes um um when treating patients yeah i i love the idea of um uh using terpenes um with medicinal cannabis the the only problem is uh the products we have at the moment generally aren't labeled as the what terpenes are contained in within the products we know there's probably going to be a nice synergy um adds terpenes to cannabinoids like like the entourage effect that you were talking about we're probably going to get more therapeutic benefits if you are headed um selected with um certain cannabinoids there um but unfortunately the products um what and what is available on the market to show what terpene concentrations are in the products or what other cannabinoids are contained within the product um is very limited so we doctors are basically only limited to talking in terms of cbd and thc at the moment yeah yeah that doesn't surprise me i think that um in due course there will be more sophistication around um what actually goes into the product uh from from separating from thc and cbd and there'll be more there'll be more requests for doctors wanting to understand what terpenes are available in the product and it again it comes down to that that commonality piece if if doctors are identifying that beta-carotene which i mentioned before is commonly um associated to products that are prescribed for pain then that's also encourages doctors to look out for those products to prescribe so it's kind of that marker that creates a an insight marker for doctors that are paying attention to what goes into the product but that will that will evolve over time another question in terms of patient access should patients seek access through an authorized prescriber instead of through sas arranged by their local gp and so why um again david i'll revert to you for that question considering that you're a prescriber yeah well i guess um whether they're authorized subscribers or they're doing it through the sas application scheme essentially you're going to get you know um at the end of it the same sort of products um it's really about i guess the knowledge that the doctor has about the stuff and you know how how well do they know the product how well do they know how to titrate um what to look for in terms of side effects what sort of interactions can occur and so experience is an important thing if a gp is only prescribed you know one or two scripts in the last 12 months then you know i would say you know maybe you know um be a bit cautious as to make sure making sure that they have um you know enough experience behind them before um before embarking on this so um yeah i personally don't really mind if gps are prescribing as long as they've got enough knowledge to back up what they're what they're actually doing because um unfortunately i've seen um some some doctors prescribing products that may not have proven to be that that appropriate for for that specific indication that something does happen yeah that makes sense further question adam the single licensing framework implemented by odc is this in effect now or still in the amendment stage i it's i don't think it's in the amendment stage i'm not sure if it's i think it's in effect i think it's an effect but i'm not entirely sure i haven't looked into that for quite some time but i don't i don't that's definitely past the amendment stage the um the the editing or the tweaking of the of the details so sorry i don't have a a concise answer for that question okay um and another audience question what's the actual clinical proof on cbd impacting specificity yeah i'll i'll i'm not a doctor i can only reference what i've read but you know when you've got a doctor i'll i'd ask you that same question yes um well there is um [Music] you know a pbs um approved medicinal product called sativex which is um approximately 50 cbd for 50 thc which is uh has been approved for multiple sclerosis and most a lot of those symptoms in this are related to pain and spasticity so um there there is uh and to get pbs um uh sort of authority to be able to um to prescribe this medication i mean uh i mean that means that there's been good clinical evidence um based on on on these sort of products before it can be approved so there's some um some clinical evidence there i i mean i can't give you the exact names of the the papers at the moment because i just can't rattle them off off the top of my head but um from a specific assessor perspective um we we know cannabinoids can be helpful but probably most of the heavy lifting is done by the thc component rather than the cbd component another question is how can you encourage gps to open their minds and have accurate information regarding cannabis use for the medical reasons someone closely asked a gp in a large regional center in victoria and was told if it became known i was prescribing that i'll have every druggie lining up at my door absolutely no interesting regarding the long-term effects please education i mean i would agree with that i think um there is still a lot of stigma and um concern around medicinal cannabis um and how it can sort of harm there's a lot of myths around the schools and how how they can be harmful for people would you agree with that yeah i'd say so there's a huge lack of education any doctor that that puts that type of comment forward clearly doesn't understand how canvas works in the human body and that's fair enough it's you know felt relatively new science um started coming out in the 1960s um the endocannabinoid system is a fascinating physiological system that operates across your 1911 physiological the 11 main physiological systems in the body it kind of acts as a as a as a communication um conduit to ensure that anything that's overworking [Music] i'm just trying to explain this in a really basic way anything that's too that's overworking um slows down and everything anything that's under working speeds up it really helps balance out various systems in your body to ensure that you maintain a state of homeostasis so it just so happens that the cannabis plant beautifully binds to the receptor sites across the body that this system uh that is built around this system so uh when the crackers say that druggies will line up out their door it might be true but they'd be lining up for for the for healing purposes for you know maybe opioid replacements or or pain replacements because they've been unfortunately you know prescribed medicines that you know have some pretty nasty side effects uh that doctor that kind of comments quite naive but it's understandable because again there hasn't been you're dealing with thousands of doctors and only a handful of those thousands actually don't know what cannabis cannabis is how it works how to titrate out of dose etc so it doesn't surprise me that that comments um been thrown out there but it's disappointing nonetheless well i think that's that's pretty much all of our questions from the audience today um did you have any extra um pearls of wisdom that you wanted to offer the audience before we wrap this up uh nothing specific comes to mind i'm very much appreciative that everyone tuned in thank you for your interest david thank you for um taking the courage to prescribe cannabis and becoming a doctor that specializes in this space there's not enough of you so deep gratitude to you for this uh and uh it was an absolute pleasure i really appreciate being here right well we've really really enjoyed having you on this uh thank you so much for attending um uh understand your time is very valuable um so we're very very appreciative and i hope that um the audience is um appreciative of that i'm sure they are appreciative of that as well so thank you again hopefully if you're um if you're up for it maybe we can do a follow-up later on in the next few months to just uh pick your brains again i'm always uh i always enjoy a quality conversation so you just let me know when great awesome thank you so much for your time my pleasure take care all the best
hy_nWGXzV14,Medicinal Cannabis in Chronic Pain,2020-09-09T18:55:02Z,welcome everyone to the second of two webinars hosted by the lung health foundation on medicinal cannabis my name is jennifer mckinnon and i am the senior manager of professional education and clinical practice at the lung health foundation in february 2020 the ontario lung association became the lung health foundation at the lung health foundation we are dedicated to ending gaps in the prevention diagnosis and care of lung disease in canada we invest in the future by driving groundbreaking research and giving our patients and their families the programs and support they need today's talk is titled medicinal cannabis in treating chronic pain before i introduce our speaker please note that everyone has been muted for the duration of the presentation please use the question and answer feature at the bottom of your screen to submit any questions the presentation will be approximately 40 minutes with 5 to 10 minutes for questions at the end it is now my pleasure to introduce our speaker dr martin chason is the medical director of palliative care at william osler health system he was previously medical director palliative care at the ottawa hospital cancer center and the palliative rehabilitation program at the elizabeth fury hospital in ottawa his undergraduate training in medicine and surgery was at the university of praetoria in 1983. later he obtained a specialist degree in internal medicine and medical oncology and a master of philosophy in palliative medicine at the university of cape town in south africa he is a founding member of the palliative care working group and faculty member of education at the european society of medical oncology he holds professorships at the universities of toronto mcmaster ottawa and mcgill he has in excess of a hundred peer-reviewed publications abstracts and book chapters he lectures internationally on cancer patient rehabilitation and approaches to treatment so i'll turn it over to you dr jason if you want to share your screen and we'll get started thanks everyone okay well thank you very much to the organizers and for having me here for the second round and for those people that were with us last week and there are a few slides which i am going to be using again in order to uh push forward some of the points that i have for the second part of the communication so um and i would really appreciate some some questions at the end of all of this so that we can generate some discussion in where this is going forward so the ideas of what i'd really like to to bring forward today is to try and get a basic understanding of the endocannabinoid system within the human body and to see what is the function of it to know what is the existing evidence regarding the use of cannabis and cannabinoids for pain and other medical purposes and of course to eventually recognize that there are potential side effects which will have subsequent contraindications for cannabis and the cannabinoids you know this is a relatively new field that we're going into despite the fact that it's a very old system and lots of it and everybody's known about cannabis but the actual science of cannabis has really only in about the past 30 years a big come forward you know cannabis was a it was a banned substance it was told it was bad and now we see that in fact there may be some areas where cannabis has great therapeutic potential and as we move forward in this idea of using natural substances and well substances that have been used recreationally for decades how to bring them into the scientific use and practice the art of using them correctly so uh my only disclosure is that i am an advisor to tetra buy a farm and they plan to start a trial we were hoping to start at the beginning of the year but with covert that's all been pushed towards the end of the year so let's look at what is medical cannabis it could be dried cannabis it could be cannabis oil um recently we're now starting to see the synthetic cannabis uh cannabinoids come into use which is more a and a a more scientific formulation which of which is pure and which we know the exact ingredients on we know that cannabis has really been used for a very very long time and for the people that have come forward we could see that it's registered registrated users have tripled over the past six years you know um chronic pain is probably the most common indication for why people use cannabis um and generally we know that people that use cannabis and people that prescribe cannabis would like to be better informed of the workings the availability the indications and the contraindications of cannabis so we do know that the the cannabis basically looks with thc and cbd and thc produces many of the psychoactive adverse effects of cannabis smoking or ingestion and cbd which is non-psychoactive um and it's usually the cbd component that is analgesic neuroprotective can be anti-convulsant anti-metic anti-spasmodic and most importantly i think is that it does definitely have anti-inflammatory properties now anti-inflammatory is is a big news of uh because we now starting to see across the spectrum that many diseases and many side effects and many consequences of whether it's cancer or cardiovascular disease has to do with inflammation if we look at something like like anorexia calcium syndrome the crp which is c-reactive protein which is a surrogate for the activity of inflammation is a very important measurement so inflammation does seem to be playing a role in very many disease processes the endocannabinoid system as we explained is a very old system and you the human type cannabinoid receptors actually were seen in invertebrate stage fish pre-fish evolution so there's endogenous which is natural human cannabinoids and these are molecules that are basically fat soluble and found in the fat and as we know the brain has got a lot of fat so this is where these molecules tend to aggregate is in the fatty nervous system and if we think about an endogenous opioid system the morphines the into the the opioid receptors and how we could use these opioid receptors to treat pain because they are naturally occurring so too with the cannabis and the endocannabinoid receptors we can use them by modulating the amount by modulating the affinity and the attachment and the activation we can use cannabis and such like substances in order to modulate those systems so i'm going to just show you that cbd-1 receptors are prime found primarily in the nervous system and cbd-2 in the immune system they have different functions actually we spoke about that earlier but they do have overlap to a wide variety and range of cannabinoids that are used therapeutically different species may have a different distribution and a different receptor sensitivity comparing for instance example a motion regulated part of a of a rat brain is more sensitive than a human's to cannabinoids so rats tend to walk along a straight line more crookedly than what humans do if they are stimulated to the same degree by by cannabinoids now this slide i'd really like you to to look in because it's a to me it's my one of my favorite slides where i have a look where are these cb 1 receptors cerebral cortex having a look that these receptors are involved in decision making in emotional behavior once again looking at the chordate nucleus and i'm looking to to show you that learning and memory is very important and does have a very important effect which is stimulated and controlled and modulated by the cannabinoids so we've got memory and learning we have a look at the pertainment once again you've got various types of learning the uh looking at the amygdaloid nuclei which is responsible for anxiety and stress emotion fear and pain and this if you have a look at anybody within terminal disease such as cancer that's where we've got large amount of anxiety stress emotion fear and pain so pain and emotion and stress really go hand in hand of one part of a circle holding hands with the next part of the circle the more pain the more emotion the more anxiety the more anxiety the more pain so they bring them together and if we could find a penis of substances like the cannabinoids in order to treat these anxieties and pain the amygdaloid is where it would be looking at the hippocampus once again memory and learning um substantia [ __ ] which is a in you know we've got reward so this is why cannabinoids do tend to have a favorable effect on people all of these neuro receptors inside the brain do play a role the last one is just to mention the the function of emesis of vomiting in the dorsal vagal complex so cannabinous we know that the two main types which is the indica and the sativa but there are a multitude of other subspecies just like we see species of different types of tea and they may look the same but they smell differently they may have a different color they may taste differently so too with the cannabinoids because it's a plant really it does vary in their different contents of how much thc how much cannabidiol cannabinoids and the various other metabolites of which are here now is in excess of a thousand different types of metabolites that one gets from cannabis itself it will be important now just to give a quick description of the pharmacokinetics of these drugs within the human body and they depend on the formulation of the drug and the root of administration and these are the standard pharmacokinetic variables that we look at the absorption distribution metabolism and elimination so looking at the absorption we know that cannabinoids are administered via inhalation and they exhibit similar pharmacokinetics to those that are administered intravenously so if you breathe in a drug and you can give it intravenously that the pharmacokinetics actually are very similar after inhalation both the plasma concentrations of cbd and thc are attained rapidly that's within three two minutes three to 10 minutes and maximum concentrations are higher relative to oral ingestion the bioavailability of thc after inhalation reportedly ranges from 10 to 35 and this is attributable to the variability both the intra and the inter subject variability in relational characteristics because maybe some person takes a bigger path takes more regular puffs um than somebody that's got smaller lungs maybe it's also got something to do in the way that drug has been administered is it with a a cigarette or a joint is it within a chamber is it within a vaporizer so these are variables which will eventually have an effect on the amount of drug that is is absorbed inhaled cbd was reported to have an average systemic bioavailability of 31 which is really almost the same as that of thc the pharmacokinetics of vaporized and smoked cannabinoids are relatively comparable now sativex which is an epiximal or an oral mucospray those inhalations undergo rapid absorption by the oral new mucosa and are hints are helpful to relieve symptoms which need immediate relief so some of these sativex they do provide immediate relief because they produce high drug concentrations relatively higher to than if somebody would ingest it so you've got an oral mucosa it's absorbed pretty directly there's no first-past effect and it goes straight into the blood now transdermal administration of cannabinoids avoids the first part effect of the metabolism but due to the highly extremely hydrophobic nature this limits the diffusion across the aqueous layers of the skin in vitro studies with human skin have determined that the permeability of cbd is to be tenfold higher than that of thc cannabinoids distribute relatively well to well vascularized organs like the lung the heart the brain and the liver with subsequent equilibration into less vascularized tissues so they you have an affinity to go for the well-vascularized tissues as we said like the heart and the lung and then after some time will equilibrate into the other tissues so that an equivalent amount and concentration is achieved throughout the body but of course the distribution may be affected by the body's size and composition as well as different disease states as well as some of the other drugs which can affect the permeability of the blood brain barrier knowing of course that chronic with chronic use cannabinoids can accumulate in the adipose tissue and then are very slowly released so half-lifes may be increased in patients that use these drugs chronically the metabolism of thc is predominantly via the liver via a cytochrome p450 or cp-450 although there are some other cryptochromes that are involved which you can see the sub-2c9 and c2c19 predominantly excreted in the feces and the urine they undergo glucorodination and this is how they get into the urine and into the feces important to note is that lipophilic thc is able actually to cross over into the placenta and is then excreted in human breast milk cbd is really metabolized primarily by the liver which we see once again but a different sub 2c19 which is also thc but it's the third most important and mainly fecal excretion although there is some urinary excretion and interestingly enough at this stage very little is known about the pharmacological activity of the metabolites of cbd which seems to be the less obnoxious of them of the thc compounds in humans the estimates of the elimination elimination half-life do vary that's important as we'll speak later why this is important but the first initial half-life four to six minutes and then a long terminal half-life of 22 hours so in a person that does not use the drug chronically there's a half-life that can last almost a day in relatively longer elimination half la is observed in those people that are chronic heavy users because as i explained they retain the drug within the adipose tissue within the fatty tissue which then is released very slowly into the bloodstream and eventually in term eliminated cbd does have slightly longer terminal half-life we can see that the average half-life following intravenous dose is about 24 plus minus 6 hours and an investigation of repeated daily continuous oral administration actually shows an elimination half-life that can go up to five days which is quite long the dose response and drug drug interaction information is unfortunately lacking this also plays a big role interpretation and understanding of clinical trials is that we don't understand if you give more drug really does that produce that effect or if you give less drug does it really produce less of an effect and there is definitely this potential for the interaction between either inhibiting or inducing the enzymes which which either break down or prevent the breakdown of the substances or also have an effect on the transporters of the drug within the human body both cannabis and tobacco smoking together induce the that p that sip 1a2 when they smoke together so this may play a role in whether the effect may be enhanced or may be reduced simply by smoking tobacco along with the with the cannabis some studies which are in vitro reported that cbd significantly inhibits the p p-glycoprotein mediated drug transport and what p-glycoprotein does is the miniature drug is transported into the cell the p-glycoprotein which is actually a resistant type of protein pumps that active substance out of the cell we've seen in many of the chemotherapeutic compounds that of adriamycin etopocite these are drugs that are strong inducers of the p-glycoprotein system and so when patients may become resistant to a drug or their cancer cells become a resistant to a drug it's due to this p-glycoprotein transplant [Music] so let's have a look at some of the effects of the the drug on the cns drowsiness alertness impairment of short-term memory and you saw where that was important when i showed it to you in the brain slowed reactions decreased motor coordination and muscle tone accuracy of psychomotor task performance so one's perception is definitely uh impaired by the combined effects of these drugs um working at various structures within the central nervous system at lower doses one can get the mild euphoria the relaxation the decreased anxiety which we once again saw with that worked out in the amygdaloid nuclei higher doses can increase anxiety and panic reactions and there have been people and this is something specifically in the elderly population where paranoia can can take place is it because the people have less fat or maybe the receptors are more sensitive and once again the dose response relationship is not quite clear in any standard group of people but we do know that at which dose we're not sure but higher doses do tend to cause what we would call in layman's turban a bad trip of course the other effects are the pain perception and i once again say perception because when speaking to these patients they would say we still feel the pain but it just isn't as important or doesn't affect me as emotionally or it doesn't have an effect on my functional status as it did when i did not take the drug but we still feel the pain of course anti-nausea and anti-metic effects by the cb1 receptors meant to increase appetite which it does in healthy volunteers unfortunately in all the trials so far been done actual appetite has not been increased but in the trial that we did to you know 2012 13 what we found was taste perception was altered and uh and also discussion which is um abnormal tastes distorted taste is is decreased so patients found that they tasted food better they wanted more of it but it didn't really have an effect on the appetite and the so-called munchies which we were all hoping patients with advanced cancer and an erector coxy would have has not unfortunately materialized now there is some reports of anti-convulsant effects with with these drugs but it's not via a cb1 receptor and i think that is important tonight on the neuromuscular system we've got antisposmotic effects and this has been well utilized in some of the drugs with spasticity and even recommended for pain and spasticity of patients that have multiple sclerosis cardiovascular effects patients get their hearts beat faster they have a better cardiac output but it also induces a myocardial oxygen need so if a patient has narrowed arteries in their heart and they suddenly need more oxygen because their heart is beating faster then they may experience angina respiratory it does increase bronchodilation and there were very many old people and i still remember this in south africa who would actually take marijuana in order to treat their asthma and but they would not take it with cigarettes it would just be pure marijuana and that would increase the decrease the airways resistance allow them to breathe the air out much easier and cope with the effects of asthma bronchial irritation and of course cannabis smoke is similar to tobacco smoke as far as irritation goes but the evidence for any obvious causing of lung cancer is lacking eyes patients get you know to dilatation probably from the heart the heart that's beating faster the blood pressure that goes up and yet again we come back to this old albatross which always seems to come back at us is what is the effect on immune function and how does it stop the immune response or the the overt immune response because as we know very often the immune response that we see in patients with cancer has been ineffective in fact with the new uh inhibitors that break checkpoint inhibitors they're turning off some of that immune function and patients are actually doing better so the old story of well you need a fever to fight an infection may not actually be true so cannabinoids do have an effect on the immune function although it's unclear exactly so those were the acute effects and let's look at some of the chronic effects cognitive changes verbal fluency learning deficits these are people that are taking high doses and can get a chronic intoxication syndrome of apathy you know we don't feel like going to school we don't feel like doing homework we don't feel like playing sport we don't feel like socializing we just feel like sitting in our room this has been one of the big problems that they found with younger users who have been using it chronically is this chronic apathetic syndrome now whether that's just as the newer generation is or whether this is in fact what was seen in many older generations when they were younger it is an entity and there is a cannabis dependent categorization on the dsm-4 and we'll go through those a little later just the chronic effects on the respiratory system is chronic inflammatory chest diseases and those into the copd the chronic obstructive airways diseases we're once again inflammation is a big role plays a big role we know that steroids whether inhaled or whether or all given orally to patients that have these inflammatory diseases do play a role and it's to in to decrease the inflammation just uh if so speaking of some effects that are specific to cbd not to thc there's reduction in the they may cause a reduction in the the in the thc associated adverse effects um specifically the psychotropic and the cardiovascular effects so that cbd may in fact counteract the effects of thc um inherently but of course cbd has been reported with fatigue and sunderlands it does you take it at night it does help people to go to sleep but chronic long-term users because they're not excreting the drug may become overtly somnolent and fatigued and of course if they use it with other medications there's limited data regarding the safety and efficacy of cannabis in the elderly population and this is because we know that in the context of the elderly this is associated comorbidity is polypharmacy there's increased cognitive vulnerability and predisposed to more severe manifestations from the drugs such as sedation we also know that the pharmacokinetic parameters are influenced by age such as reduced hepatic and renal clearance and relative decreases in body fat so some of the drug may remain active for longer periods of time and in fact i've had two patients they've both been elderly that suffered this acute toxic syndrome where they became extremely paranoid and they had a really bad trip and confused medical cannabis can be administered through different techniques and methods such as smoking vaporization and ingestion and the vaporization produces effects that are very similar to smoking but it's while reducing the exposure to the by-products of the combustion and possible carcinogens which then decrease the adverse respiratory syndromes no clear association in a number of reviews that looked at the pulmonary effect of smoking and the association between cannabis and lung cancer and the conclusion of many of these studies that there is no clear association or only a marginally statistical significant association these are the three types that we've seen specifically in canada although we don't have the draeneibinol anymore that was the oral form of the synthetic delta 9 thc nabalone sesame which is available and it's treated for severe um chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting and the nebyximals the cetavix which has been used and i will speak a little bit about this later as the adjunctive treatment for patients with symptomatic relief of spasticity with with multiple sclerosis or in neuropathic pain or in patients with advanced cancer who experience moderate or severe pain during the time that they're taking as much tolerated dose of strong opioid that they can just to go into a subject of the problem designing clinical trials is that there's no data or almost no data on the pharmacokinetics during the chronic treatment we know that there's a longer half-life and therefore at a greater risk of accumulation and the monitoring of these levels needs to be done regularly so we don't have data on that to know enough to go into a clinical trial with patients that have been using it for quite a while as well the distribution distribution between the plasma and the tissue may invalidate ordinary methods of measurement of bioavailability so the distribution is not understood the accumulation is not fully understood and we do know that the cannabidiols is an effective if it's inhibitor if it's given a qp and yet it's an inducer if used chronically of the p54 and so there's this increased risk of using an interaction with other drugs whether it's smoking or it applies mainly to the smoking cannabis but not to the pure cannabinoid treatment so there's a difference once already many people have claimed indications for therapeutic use which is a lifelong use not just an acute use and then over but more lifelong so we have to consider of course that using these drugs may cause pulmonary damage it may cause tolerance and you have to increase the dose and of course there is although it's small there is a risk of dependence the safety margin you can get somebody using the same amount of drug and yet the one person freaks out and the other person tolerates the drug just quite calmly so there's a therapeutic range that that can cure therapeutic effect that can occur within the same dose range subjective effects are noticeable within seconds or minutes when smoking cannabis whereas an accumulative effect is noted in chronic treatment so these are some of the difficulties in designing clinical trials another thought is what would actually be measured we need objective rather than just subjective need to qualify you know when you look at nausea are you nauseous yes or no how bad is the nausea is more difficult to determine even pain on the scale of 0 to 10 where 10 is the worst pain and 0 is no pain where is your pain how much is your pain may be different from person a to person b so also the importance of the placebo effect requires very acu accurate measures of responses and who does the measurement of those effects we know that most patients that are taking these treatments has smoked or taken the cannabis for so long that they in fact are advocates because they say it's worked so well for them so who's going to measure those effects people that have not taken it are really what we need difficult in today's times the number of available subjects for some real indications may actually be too small for property evaluation so we do need multi-center studies where people are working together with similar types of patients standardizing who's eligible who's not eligible who gets the drug how that drug is effect is measured and whether the patient is compliant whether the family is compliant and for many potential indications cannabis would have to be supplementary to other treatments so you're treating pain you should be treating you know with opioids and you treating with a cannabis not just with the cannabis so this does play a difficult role and what will the fate be for these trials if new therapies under development suddenly come along and we have now seen new inhaler units that are going to be for non-smoked cannabinoids so how are we going to compare what what the data that we have to some of the new data that we have and and how are we going to actually better separate therapeutic and side um from the from the drugs so let me just give you a background of some of the work that i'm going to go and that's really about chronic neuropathic pain which we know affects about one to two percent of the population and patients with chronic and pain have reported using smoke cannabis to relieve pain improve sleep as well as to improve meat uh mood so what they did in this study by is they treated adults who had post traumatic or post surgical neuropathic pain to receive cannabis at full potencies either at zero percent 2.5 6 or nine point four percent for over 14 days in a crossover trial participants inhaled a single 25 milligram milligram dose through a pipe three times daily and the first five days in each cycle followed by a nine day washout period and then the daily average pain intensity was measured using an 11 point numeric rating scale they recorded the effects on moods the quality of life as well as adverse effect and they only recruited 23 patients of whom 21 completed the trial the average daily pain intensity measured on the scale was lower and it did to be significant whereas patients and this was mainly for the patients that took the higher nine point four percent dose versus the zero percent dose preparations with the intermediate potency yielded intermediate but non-significant results but also those patients taking the higher dose had improved ability to fall asleep it was easier it was faster and they had improved quality of life but no differences in mood or quality of life in the lower doses was noted and these are some others in the in the particular trial they once again compared it and what they saw was once again that the average daily pain intensity measured on this 11 point numeric rating scale was lower but and the preparations with the intermediate potency yielded intermediate results that were not significantly but no cbd was in any of the products tested there was an improvement in the quality of sleep and a significant improvement in anxiety so overall some of the components of quality of the quality of life of patients was improved very small trial only 23 patients in this randomized placebo crossover controlled crossover trial in cannabis cigarettes in neuropathic pain we see that there were 38 patients non-naive and they got different doses and they were delivered as two puffs followed by three paths followed by four paths and one hourly intervals so a different methodology but they saw that there was significant improvement in pain and pleasantness once again the perception and there was no change in the allodynia which is uh exaggerated pain or response to heat and worsening of attention learning and memory with active treatment so getting a little bit of better pain control although the perception is is the perception is altered but pain approach with decreased attention learning and memory in hiv associated neuropathic pain we know that despite management with opioids and other pain modifying techniques neuropathic pain continues to reduce the quality of life and daily function in patients that have hiv this trial was done a little bit ago to say 10 11 years ago when hiv was still very much in the news what they did as well was a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover for 34 patients they had to be refractory to at least two previous previous analgesic classes they got different variety of doses ranging from one to eight percent over five days followed by a washout period they were smoked and it was a phase two trial and what they found was that the outcome was a change in the pace a pain intensity measured on a descriptor differential differential scale from a pre-treatment baseline to the end of each treatment week and they also looked at mood and daily functioning so what they found was 46 of subjects at least had a thirty percent reduction in pain but they the clinical trial um that they conducted was only a phase two phase two trial so it was not really something that they could take forward and as well is that most side effects that they experienced were mild and limited but there were two subjects who really had bad side effects and they had to stop the drug just looking at chronic pain and this is in a it was published in 2006 looking at the different um effects efficacies of the different drugs look at opioids 58 said they got treatment relief now is 21 relief up to 6.3 so that was the improvement within minutes within hours within days and within weeks who still had pain relief after weeks two percent still had a pain relief after two weeks five percent after a few days and looking at the cannabinoids zero percent after weeks just three after days and eighty percent after hours so cannabinoids do play a role there's no doubt that they play a role just looking at the different one whether it's massage or acupuncture or biofeedback i don't like the fact that mag that cannabis has been put along all of these complementary and alternative therapies as i do feel that there is a definite scientific role for cannabis in treatment of patients with pain but we're not sure of the mechanism as yet so looking at the evidence as we see it and then not many studies because of health canada restrictions a lot of legal non-inhaled product is available and will be available which is now available there's extensive anecdotal experience from patients worldwide but we still feel that the cot has been put ahead of the horse the large proportion of patients who are using medical cannabis um are benefiting but it may be potential hot potentially harmful it by uninformed use it's definitely it can be intentionally and harmful and we need to know what works for which disease what doses how is it best taken in what are the other safety concerns before it can be put forward as a true standard tested treatment we don't know the dose is it 2.5 is it 2.7 is it 9 is it 3 to 5 drops which is the most common use and it's remembering of course that what you see on some of the labels is not what you find in the actual product and i remember so i think it was last year that they health canada soup and all the marijuana stores and found that many of these bottles had the wrong labels and there was an infestation of parasites so we have to know what we're looking at and we have to be sure that it's a standard treatment for a standard disease can one drive well not after four hours is what's recommended and if you smoke or if you if you eat it or take it in by mouth not after six hours one can have a euphoria which can last that long addiction cannabis is about nine percent compared with cigarette which is 32 percent addiction addiction rate alcohol of 15 hero and 23 and cocaine 17 was just interesting to see that heroin is less than cigarettes so you can get an ex experience a a nicotine-like withdrawal once stopping the cannabis is it for people that have smoked nicotine and cannabis together or is it as true as what it says we're not quite sure and you need to be alert that you can have a cannabis use disorder um that can occur under circumstances similar to opioids spoken about the fact that at this stage there's no formal proof that smoking cannabis induces cancer so in summary cannabis is a plant we need a lot more research it's about what we think where the opioid puppy was 50 years ago it's not snake oil it doesn't work for everything some diseases and some symptoms it may work and for some it may work better we've got to look at the young people and the the chronically ill and the the older people not only mentally ill but all the people who have volume distribution problems um try not to smoke rather take the oil and if you're going to go on a trial let's start the trials that start low and go slow but please advise people to participate in the clinical trials so that we can move this forward thank you very much thank you dr jason um i'll just remind people to submit their questions at the bottom of the screen you can just go to the icon saying q a we do have a couple of questions that have come in dr chason um and one thing i i thought we'd start with is um and you did mention this on your slide you were talking um what i'm wondering if you could speak a little more about is um the key priorities for researchers right now like in the short term and you did touch on it but i thought we'd start with that maybe just talk a little bit about that you know when you look at them things that's a good question because i thought about that quite a lot and when i've looked at some of the trials because i've had many patients that have smoked cannabis and they all do seem to do a little bit better but when i've asked myself what is it that they're doing better about yes maybe their pains a little bit better and maybe they they smell the food better and they enjoy their food a little bit better and maybe they're not as anxious as what they were before they started smoking the cannabis and maybe they're not as nauseous as they were before they started smoking the cannabis and maybe they could breathe a little bit easier now that they started smoking the cannabis so it's working across all of those symptoms not just on one symptom so i think what we should be measuring is as the patients regards his own quality of life along all not only this the symptoms sphere but the emotional sphere the spiritual sphere because there are many people that found with the ultimate perception that they are they they're spiritual their soul feeling goes up as well and you know we cannot consider that a human being is just flesh and bones there's a mind and there's a body and there's a there's another aspect which is probably also playing a role and those kind of uh measurements need to be incorporated in order for us to find really how this struck is working oh very good thank you um so one of the questions that came in from a participant um can you comment on brain cell damage and thc so this is obviously gone on you know because it's fat soluble and because it's uh you know because because the cannabis does really go into the brain now we know that i don't know the exact number but millions of brain cells die off every minute so having a an external drug going into the brain and sitting there and however it's affecting that metabolism must have an effect you know i know that they've pushed hard to say that there's definite to brain cell damage but i haven't found any equivocal proof that that acute use of of cannabis causes acute brain cell damage we know that once a brain cell is dead it is dead it doesn't regenerate so they the is that if there is going to be enhanced death then we would expect that you know that the deterioration would be more rapid i've not yet found that people that take the cannabis have an increased incidence of dementia which is something that i would have liked to see but it may start happening remember of course that people did not volunteer that they're taking the cannabis so many people may have taken the cannabis and now presented with dementia but we don't yet have that association okay thank you thank you for that a couple more questions have come in so um how can we compare or discuss dosage is it by trial and effect i think that's what it is we have to standardize the right dose um medicinal cannabis is difficult to standardize the dose synthetic cannabinoids um as we you know i mean it's it's very much like taking the poppy plant and saying well we're going to make morphine out of this and we'll give you one poppy plant and you can have two and you can have three whereas if you synthesize and get a morphine standard and then you can compare the same doses of morphine with different people so too tears with cannabis and i think i do believe that that's the way that it will go scientifically that the the synthetic cannabinoids which are pure firstly and you know what's the constituent of it and you can reliably reproduce the exact amount of dose that is the way that we will eventually find out what is the correct dose for the correct patient okay perfect another question from a participant some family doctors will not prescribe so if patients need to or just want to buy commercially versus with a prescription how do patients ensure that their source is reliable this is a problem that helps canada have you know um it is there are doctors that don't want to scrub and we're hoping that these seminars will actually show them that they should on the other hand i do know many clinics that just prescribe you know you need to go there and you will be given the drug um i've never been to one of those clinics but i do know that they're all available and they are physicians and one would hope that the if there would be any problems that the patients would be able to go back to those physicians and say this is the effect that i had are you helping me to monitor it are you trying to help me with it or are you just handing it out so um i think that a lot of the pain clinics will be doing that because as i said the majority of it is pain but i think the value of of the cannabis is a lot more than the pain i'm of the belief that you're treating the whole person with a cannabis and so you should be looking at the whole person not just measuring the pain or the nausea the vomiting but how does that person find themselves within the in their family are they feeling that they they've still got a role is there meaning in living or not you know are you making a contribution to society that gives you meaning smoking cannabis may change that alteration from somebody feeling that they you know that they that they're a victim and they could become a victor about changing that they've got meaning in their life so measuring measurement of the effect of cannabis is not so straightforward okay very good um so another question and this is specific to something you mentioned in your presentation why did the neuropathic pain studies use thc rather than cbd okay so that remember that was taken a long time ago i think that part in the past year a few years realized that's not only cbd as i said i think there's about 1600 different components that they're discovering but at that stage that was what they were looking at they were looking more at the thc than what the cbd is yeah okay and i would do that study again with cbd in order to see what the results were and remember it was just very small just like less than 30 patients okay very good a couple more questions still before prescribing cannabis for a patient do you require the patient to sign a cannabis agreement and if yes can you share your agreement i mean maybe there's a template out there already but um they're asking specifically what you do i i've never i've never had a patient sign an agreement there may be patients that are on other kind of heavier drugs where you know that they do sign an agreement i know some of the opioid dependent patients sign this agreement if they take the methadone you know it the dependency is really so it's really negligible compared to you know even just a cigarette or alcohol so i've i've never had a patient that's become physiologically dependent perhaps psychologically dependent uh when which i think is probably more of a problem than actual physical dependency so no i've never had a patient sign an agreement okay um we have time for just a couple of more questions it's almost five to one so just a couple more questions dr jason uh can you comment on psychosis and thc so not not a direct question very very very real very real watch out for the people over 65. the the the the people with a you know with with very little body fat they may be chronically ill have never been exposed to drugs or you know any type of alterations or have a history of dependency or a history of psychiatric illnesses or history of having or even the patients having mild delirium those are the patients i would not give the structure i have seen little old ladies almost jump off buildings i've had two patients that are you know i wouldn't i won't do it again i saw it twice and i won't do it again so that it's very very real and when prescribing it watch out for the elderly frail person okay um someone asked about complaints around intestinal colic um is is that a common side effect or they didn't really specify in the question what they're asking is how common i haven't seen that written and i haven't had any patients telling me they've had that i wonder why it would okay but thank you i don't know about that thanks for addressing that um you mentioned variables but is there a recommended maximum daily dose that's probably hard to say we don't know though we don't know i would be very scared to go above the 9.4 percent though okay okay i'll i'll leave it uh to this being the last question is there a true cbd only option and if so does it also produce you know what else i saw in advert actually come through one of my emails the other day that is a true cbd option that's now available in in canada i don't know it it's it's hemp hemp is what cbd is and it's a pure hemp is it going to work i would hope it's going to work you don't need a you don't need a prescription for it that's what that what this advert said to me um but i think that i think that there is an amount of therapeutic validity for the thc as well so whether it's just cbd but once again the psychosis that it you have to be careful you've got to be careful history or there's any slight dementia or any previous reaction to some of these psychoactive drugs no ways don't do it okay very good um so we are approaching the um the end time so we're close to one o'clock i just want to say to participants thank you for joining and asking questions today um it's great to have you and thank you dr chason for your presentation and taking time to be with us we are sending a survey out to participants after this so those of you who are um who have registered and participated you'll get a short survey if you could just give us your feedback and if and let us know if there are any other topics along this area that you might be interested in so you'll see that shortly in your email so thank you everybody and uh we'll um end it there thanks very much thank you very much everybody i enjoyed being with you all i didn't see you but i enjoyed it okay thanks a lot bye
SdzRdz1C7u0,Goodfellow Unit Webinar: Prescribing medicinal cannabis,2020-09-08T20:30:25Z,kia ora everyone welcome to this good fellow unit webinar on an updated talk on prescribing medicinal cannabis tonight we will be going through a talk with graham gilbranson he's a cannabis consultant gp an addiction specialist he works at cannabis care in west auckland welcome graeme thank you uh tena koto katoa thank you for joining us with this webinar in uh 2019 i gave a talk on cbd this is an update focusing really on changes from the 1st of april 2020 and i'll talk you through the good news and the bad news with regard to those changes so thank you for joining us i'd like to also thank tool ray for paying a fee for this talk and for other work that i've done for them they've not seen this presentation i've had full control over it and my practice and i'm sure yours too as prescribers is to keep our patients foremost regardless of what brand we're prescribing i've set this up with a little bit of a contents page so if you come back to it as you may want to if you've suddenly got a prescribing question this might direct you to the right part of the presentation so introduction i'll talk about the referendum with the election in october 2020 and the focus tonight really is on thc and cbd and how we can prescribe those i'll talk about the changes since the 1st of april 2020 i've got some case histories and as we go through we'll talk a bit more about prescribing cbd sativex and other thc cbd blends there are some slides at the end which uh i may not address directly but they'll be posted for you to look at if you want to find out more about green fairies other reasons to support the legalization and control of cannabis palliative cannabis and what if your patient wishes to import cannabis so let's start with the idea that cannabis is not usually smoked when it's given medicinally or not as a joint and we'll talk more about that later so currently we've got drops and i've just picked three of the six or eight brands that are available at the moment just showing you that these are bottles of cbd in oil that are taken by mouth through a dropper there are oral sprays available and we'll talk about the one that's currently able to be prescribed i'll mention vaping devices bombs have their place ointments creams bombs but are not available on prescription at this point things like arthritis may respond quite well if there's just one or two joints rubbing in a bone okay the good news well all medical practitioners may prescribe cbd or the sativex spray which contains thc and cbd to any patient for any condition chronic pain and emotional distress respond really well to cbd so it's a good place to start and if you're not sure what to prescribe you can look up cannabidiol in your ems the difference between street cannabis and what we prescribe tends to be this because of prohibition cannabis has become more and more concentrated so a small amount is easier to hide and is better value and while many of mine and perhaps your patients will be using cannabis for medical reasons it's going to be high if i can use that word in thc and probably less abundant in cbd and if you're wanting something for your anxiety you're wanting more of the cbd so street or illicit cannabis tends to be high in thc and that's the euphorian component but it has many other properties and in the right way can be a very useful medicine and i suppose we could compare it with the opioids for instance in the wrong doses people might experience euphoria but in the right doses they'll get the desired effect because of black market cannabis and the the way our patients are using this i'd support legalization and it's called cannabis legalization and control would we rather have something that's controlled or currently prohibited but the same people would use it anyway where cannabis has been legalized really the uptake hasn't been any greater across the world it's the same people smoking it but they are certain of the quality and the safety it's been tested for contaminants and really legalization and control is part of a harm reduction strategy we need to mention section 29 and if you just uh follow my red highlighting so section 29 medicines these are called new medicines they don't have a consent for distribution and advertising and so the rules are no person shall advertise the availability of any medicine to which this section applies section 29 is a fairly blunt instrument to protect the public from advertising but it also has been a huge restriction that companies who are importing cannabis products mainly cbd at this stage are unable to talk to prescribers to pharmacists and to the public our patients because of this restriction and it also makes my talk a little bit more difficult because i can't give you examples of any of the particular products but we'll keep that in mind section 29. i want to quickly get to the point about cbd and thc and so cbd we've got at the moment and so what are the actions where would you prescribe cbd analgesia muscle relaxant anxiolytic antipsychotic yes using cannabis for mental health anti-convulsant and certainly i've used it in that way anti-inflammatory neuroprotective the story there is that american football players who have been smoking weed and get concussed in the game seem to recover quickly uh uh with the cannabis in the system because of its neural protection uh thc uh is a stronger analgesic a stronger muscle relaxant than cbd and it has antibiotic properties if a primary issue is insomnia thc may be a better option than cbd though cbd can be useful because insomnia generally carries anxiety and dealing with that and people often sleep better but yeah the main difference as i've highlighted in purple is thc is the euphorian component and that means that it is the part that may put the user at risk or impairment for instance with driving and i'd like to mention what's known as the entourage effect if we combined cbd and thc there's a synergy and so a little goes a lot further with that combination and just wanting to get straight to the point for busy viewers here's a simple dosing chart that works quite well across a way a range of products so cbd 100 milligrams per mil is uh the product that has been around for uh two and a half years and uh this is a dosing chart that i would use for this or something similar but you might well use it for a combination when this is available for prescribers other than non-gp specialists and it's a fairly simple plan where you start with a quarter of a mil in the evening and after three days go to twice daily increase you are really starting low and going slow this is classic advice with prescription cannabis and so you're just building up titrating to effect nothing new to prescribers we do this with many medications and if you're lucky and the patient is doing well they can level off at a lower dose others will need something like one mil 100 milligrams a day of this product or others will find that they don't get benefit and need to get to a higher dose and over time with practice at prescribing you may find that you can actually lift the dose day by day rather wait every three days though perhaps if you're introducing a thc blend you might want to be a bit more cautious and find that this is a useful start low go slow process my patients tell me i don't want to get high i just want relief from their symptoms pain nausea insomnia anxiety etc and cbd is a good place to start it's the non-euphoriant very low risk of side effects and those tend to be minor uh my counters that 90 of people report no side effects as we've said it covers a wide range of products and look for people with intractable conditions where standard treatments are not helping i think cbd is often a good place to start this is really long-term rather than acute conditions what are the changes since the 1st of april i'll take you through the next slides to keep it simple this is what you can look up for an update medicinal cannabis agency that's the website and there's a lot of information there i've got several key points which i've taken from that website so since the 1st of april medicinal cannabis products include dosage products or prescribers are familiar with that that's what we do and this is tablets capsules oral liquids so fixed preparations where we recommend certain doses and patients can take those what is new is that since the 1st of april regulations have allowed us to prescribe dried products i'll just say that there's nothing available at this point but we're warming you up for this so these are products intended for vaporization not intended for smoking and not as a food and i'll talk more about that later so uh all medicinal cannabis products are prescription medicines unapproved products let's just uh clarify this so these have not been assessed for safety and efficacy and uh really yeah that's the summary not being subject to clinical trials so unapproved products are currently being assessed by the ministry of health and we're waiting for them to publish a list of products nothing has got through their assessment and this is an area of real frustration to patients who were expecting that such products would have been assessed by the 1st of april and would be available for prescription now and here we are in september however they're not available and patients are missing out on that while the ministry and various companies are assessing various bla blends of thc and cbd uh various combinations that i'm looking forward to prescribing so approved products these have been assessed through clinical trials and the ministry website says that we can all prescribe medicinal cannabis products such as sativex in fact this is the only one and the reason i'm allowed to give you the name sativex is that clinical trials in england where sativex was developed over 15 years before it was on the prescription market uh the trials for multiple sclerosis mean that we have some confidence that it can reduce the muscle spasms associated with ms but we're a lot more likely to be using it off label here but uh in summary any prescriber can prescribe cbd or sativex at this stage and we're waiting for other uh blends of thc and cbd i'll talk more about sativex in a minute we're at the end of a six-month transition at where the current rules are cbd sativex any prescriber and in the six months i was fully expecting that other blends of thc and cbd would be available and that i would be able to report back to you tonight on my experience with that uh well uh i can talk in general terms and try and uh warm you up to the possibility of being able to prescribe in the next little while so case histories uh well it was suggested that i give one or two case histories in fact what i'm going to do is i can do better than that i can give you 1031 case histories uh and it won't take us all night so look my audit with the assistance of professor bruce harrell and a couple of his students has found that half of my patients on cbd have chronic pain and then i've divided other patients into these four groups so cancer patients emotional distress and neurological problems and i'll tell you what sort of problems i've been dealing with so yeah international literature indicates that half of people using cannabis whether it's illicit or prescription are using it for chronic pain and what sort of pain well out of 489 patients fibromyalgia and i put that at the top of the list because uh not many things help fibro but cbd it can be quite life-changing and that's a phrase that i hear from patients over and over so fibromyalgia think cbd osteoarthritis pmr low back pain and we've all got patients with low back pain that it doesn't seem to be responding to much else neuropathic pain it's great to have something that might help with far fewer side effects than the standard treatments central sensitization and you'll know this term from long-term pain situations where people get deeply ingrained pain patterns that are set up and uh easily triggered and i think cbd has a part to play and just a calming that sensitization and those recurring sensitizing experiences that patients wish to avoid endo trigeminal neuralgia uh quite a range patients have reported reduced migraine frequencies or severity emotional distress well anxiety and as we know they go together anxiety and depression and i do like this term emotional distress which covers a range of things and insomnia often goes with anxiety of course but adhd cbd can be surprisingly useful as a calming agent and uh emotional distress goes as a co-morbidity with uh many other problems and as prescribers we know this people with chronic pain are likely to be anxious or depressed tourettes if you're different and have a discontrolled situation then the emotional distress accompanying that may be reduced with cbd and asperger's so neurological symptoms uh seizures uh often needing high dose of cbd and lots of monitoring i do want to mention autism asd with challenging behavior and this is where i've seen wonderful results using this for very young people three four years old and two adults with asd and the challenging behavior that's i think distressing both to the whanau and to the patient themselves and if we can calm that anxiety often i think it's opening up the brain to learning new behaviors or socializing better and so on and so a cbd does seem to be a very safe option there parkinson's uh including with pain not so good for seizures uh sorry for tremor in parkinson's uh but often there's emotional distress chronic fatigue people talk about less brain fog with cbd uh peripheral neuropathy we know the standard treatments can be disappointing is something else that we can try spasms ms and essential tremor so all of these may have some benefit and with cancer symptoms as well the side effects of cancer therapy and so we're talking about pain we're talking about nausea vomiting emotional distress again insomnia and well with thinking of using some medicinal cannabis so just briefly how effective is it well i developed this very simple patient feedback scoring system and i try and see patients and have follow-up after a month and you can see uh half of them don't come back and why why is that well perhaps i'm expensive the prescription cannabis is expensive i do encourage people to go to their gps perhaps your gps my colleagues out there are taking over prescribing some people find that switching to illicit cannabis is a more affordable option but i gave a talk on mental health in cannabis and one of the other speakers suggested some of your patients have improved so much they don't need further treatment and so let's let's be positive and open to that as a possibility that a single month of treatment may settle down anxiety and people don't require the prescription cannabis any longer but look the good news here is in this simple uh four point score was the your experience with cbd no good good very good or excellent the a quarter of patients or 40 really have reported benefit and how many things that we prescribe give such good outcomes it's very rewarding i want to talk about what is available cbd and sativex and talk about how we might use it for unapproved conditions and i'll talk about the blends and the dried flour for vaporization which i had hoped to be available by now i'm getting somewhat impatient for a bit of variety to assist patients well yesterday was the third anniversary of quite a milestone the 7th of september on that date cbd products can be prescribed by any doctor to any patient without going to the ministry of health for approval it did take three months before the first products were available and it's been wonderful for patients since that point so cbd for three years and yes the same three bottles again my partner is doing glass work and she fused some cannabis leaves and onto a piece of glass to make a very nice background for this slide so this is how we prescribe cvd and just a normal prescription cannabidiol and this is from the chart that i showed you earlier as directed and the packs come as often 25 30 or even 40 ml packs so just looking at that in a bit more detail so uh that's how i've prescribed it and since the 1st of april we've been asked to specify the brand but of course i can't do this under section 29 so i'm not allowed to tell you any of the brands but just a reminder your pms under cannabidiol should give you the options that are available because there are a limited range of products since the 1st of april the regulations have allowed new zealand growing products and this is going to take i don't know 6 12 months maybe longer before the new zealand products have been through the system and assessed by the ministry of health and so this range of products is going to hopefully increase the availability and hopefully decrease the cost what is the cost well a 25 or 30 ml bottle costs around 250 or 300 so uh for your patient on a hundred milligrams per day this is around ten dollars a day currently eight to ten dollars a day so a bottle lasts about a month at one mil a day of course cbd comes in various other strings and uh my preference is just to stick to a hundred but uh you might be quite comfortable at prescribing 25 50 60 120 200 milligrams per mil these are all available but uh i certainly like uh the elegance of the 100 milligram per ml preparations uh i write the script you write the script uh it goes to the pharmacy and the pharmacy orders it from the wholesaler cdc pro farmer hcl etc and it should arrive the next day for the patient to collect and just to comment about cbd it is fine out of the fridge for up to six months thc is a bit more delicate and should be kept in the fridge back to this chart again over and over the reminder is start low go slow this is a very convenient way to do it start with quarter of a mil in the evening and increase to double that this is often an effective day often an effective dose and i actually like to split it 0.25 of a mil four times a day and many people find that that works somewhat better but others find just remembering the doses and the convenience twice daily dosing works for them and of course if it's not effective then increase the dose until you find the right level my optimal dose is let's talk about sativex and so this is called a balanced preparation because it's got pretty much equal thc tetrahydrocannabidiol and cbd cannabidiol and so it's dissolved in alcohol with peppermint oil it comes as a little spray bottle and because it's not section 29 i can show you there and you pull the lid off and uh this is a an empty one just spray it on the tongue or inside the mouth and so it's very easy but it does cost about nine hundred dollars for a pack of three that's the standard size and uh each has got 90 sprays in it so three sprays a day it can last for three months and it would cost about ten dollars a day is a dosing chart this is taken from the mebs medsafe website and uh you can see uh the images there of how to spray this is not a patient it's from the internet and so it's a simple titration again start low go slow and start with a spray at night and the same on the second day and then by the third day two sprays and the instructions suggest there should be at least 15 minutes gap between the sprays just so that the patient's not overdosing so a simple chart it comes as a package insert in that pack and uh i think patients find it fairly clear to use 12 is thought to be the maximum well that the cost is getting what up to what 40 dollars a day there so uh for many people the the uh the pack of uh three bottles uh is uh going to last them for a month or two and you're going to use that when you need something stronger than just cbd and i'll go through the indications again shortly uh this is a real bug bear that anything with more than 2 thc is specialist only and if you want to read about it the the website there medicinal cannabis agency information and it states that the application needs to be written by a specialist appropriate to the medical condition being treated and that's so that that specialist would know that there's potential benefit against known adverse effects and that goes to this email at the ministry of health and they've got a flow chart and so there are a couple of products that are available now to non-gp specialists such as thc cvd 10 milligrams per mil or thc 25 milligrams per ml and the medical council assures me that as a general practitioner that i am a specialist and so i would argue that i am a specialist appropriate to the medical condition being treated our scope of practices gps is wide and we often know our patients well or perhaps even better in many respects to non-gp specialists and i'm concerned that patients are missing out because uh the ministry of health has made it very difficult for specialist gps to be able to prescribe anything with thc and we know that there's a reluctance to prescribe such products by pain specialists rheumatologists neurologists psychiatrists etc and many gps are not comfortable about it of course there are exceptions but uh i'd love the freedom to be able to support my patients better by writing the application well once the ministry has assessed products and listed them on its website then hopefully uh it's going to be much easier for us to be able to prescribe just want to mention informed consent so in fact with any off-label use or section 29 product uh unapproved products uh we're meant to record informed consent and i just wanted so that's section 25 of the medicines act let's take it another step the code of health and disability services consumer rights says that written consent is need for experimental use so there is a lot of evidence for prescription cannabis but some of you dear viewers might be concerned that there's insufficient evidence and if you were to prescribe you would be wanting to regard that as experimental and record your written consent let's go back to this chart this is a really useful chart to help us along the way so i've said look cbd if someone's got fibromyalgia or anxiety a really good place to start but uh let's uh consider other options so for pain relief muscle relaxant anxiety antipsychotic and i have used it with benefit with people who are looking at reducing their antipsychotic medication or feel inadequately controlled and using it in combination with standard medicines anticonvulsant more effective than thc but the entourage effect as i've said below in red if the combination of the two can be much more effective than either anti-inflammatory properties and then the thc better pain relief better muscle relaxation better anti-nausea and vomiting properties appetite stimulation some will be familiar with the term the munchies uh and it can often be sedating and it has a role in these other areas there and well euphoriant i can tell you about a a 70 year old woman on sativex and she uh reports uh very good pain relief and she she uh reported back to me that sometimes i feel a little bit happy on the side effects and it's not a bad thing well you know we need to take care there but some of our medicines do make people feel happy and you know we need to be responsible prescribers let's talk a bit more about products that are here and coming and i've listed this from thc 0 so these are cbd dominant or cbd only products and i've gone right through to a thc dominant and the these are pure products just cbd only and we're likely to see perhaps various strengths of thc this is 25 milligrams per mill with no cbd so available now to non-gp specialists however uh cbd you you know by now that any of us may prescribe that to any patient and these are proposed blends that uh are either being assessed by the ministry of health or on their way and you can see quite a number of combinations and this may be a useful one this is a balanced equal thc and cbd available now to non-gp specialists and start low go slow and that means that you'd probably look at uh cbd or cv dot d dominant for most people and why is that well uh i'll draw your attention to this so this chart here i don't use the word psychoactivity i would use dysphoria euphoria impairment so the more thc the greater the chance of impairment uh in the product so starting down this end here pure cbd very low risk of impairment like driving is hardly ever an issue unless the rare case of sedation but the more thc even with a balance and here we've got a combination of thc and cbd but the more thc uh the the greater the chance of impairment think tramadol threat morphine think oxycodone and uh so start low uh low dose and start down this end of things so just to reiterate to start with the lowest dose and that makes sense if patients are paying they don't want to start with a very expensive large dose and so just uh covering this point again a low thc high cbd is often a good way to start with a low risk of adverse effects and then if you are looking at thc no more than 2.5 milligram per dose or initially per day and i'll explain that in a minute uh increases tolerated and consider splitting 2 three or even four times a day so adverse effects uh drowsiness and this is really cannabis based medicines this is a wide range of products this is mainly the thc because cbd tends to be a safer option but these are the sorts of side effects that we see and this is always a curious one isn't it euphoria as a side effect but you certainly want to avoid psychosis paranoia dysphoria etc uh too much cannabis can lead to hyperemesis these are unusual symptoms and far less likely start low go slow interactions i'm careful with warfarin i increase inrs but patients tell me that the warfarin seems to be unaffected and the newer anticoagulants again i would be looking at monitoring or having the patient monitor for symptoms watch out for alcohol and sedation levels have increased and that can assist those who wish to taper off these and and i do have patience on a combination of anti-seizure medication plus the cbd contraindications well yeah not much research with regard to pregnancy and breastfeeding however severe hyperemesis gravidarum it may be that cbd you would weigh up is a safe option when nothing else is assisting with such a distressing illness and as we know there are two patients involved in in the whanau so yeah it may be uh worth considering and you'd want consent for sure history of psychosis well i use cbd but i'd be very cautious about thc there arrhythmias may be at risk with thc avoided with severe ischemic heart disease and we've talked about interactive drugs here's a new area for prescribers and it's not here yet we're waiting for companies to submit applications and uh i uh going on current experience it's going to take the ministry of health a very long time to assess such products but let me explain that okay we've got uh what's known as dried flower cannabis or botanical cannabis let's zoom in so with flowers you've got petals and this is an internet image of a petal uh it's a photograph showing the trichomes these are the hairs on the petals and these are resin capsules this is where the plant makes the cannabinoids and the terpenes which are the essential oils that give cannabis its characteristic aroma and may have some therapeutic benefit in combination with the cannabinoids we don't have time tonight to go into detail but just to explain that the sticky resin on the outside of the petals uh in the trichomes uh is going to be included in the dried flour put this in a vaporizer that's meant to be an approved medical device and what you're doing is you're heating and vaporizing the active compounds rather than setting fire to it as with a joint and breathing in soot and tars and uh look at this point i would make the comment that 40 years of research has not shown lung cancer from cannabis smoking cannabis is a different botanical from tobacco so yeah i want to be clear about that but uh chronic airways disease is a risk with heavy smokers but using a vaping device is the way to go as a safe option so vaping devices and utensils like bongs water pipes are prohibited still under new zealand law a few more details about dried flour it's going to be some time before we can prescribe it how do we do it well there aren't particular dosing guidelines and i know that will be a concern with prescribers so it tends to be individualized uh based on titration uh avoid a high dose of thc with most people initially and we're going to see different uh blends of thc cbd in the different dried flour preparations that are made available of course someone unfamiliar with cannabis yeah you do want to avoid the stronger medicine and disorientation loss of coordination etc watch that so again start low go slow i think you've got that by now so dosing start as low as possible start with one puff uh before bedtime and how do we prescribe well the average daily dose is one to three grams per day we don't know what package sizes are going to be available but just this is equivalent to two to four joints so if a joint is roughly half to one gram or and by joint i'm talking about something about half the size of a cigarette but anyway that's the number there one to three grams per day and we need a clear end point we need to know look if this is not working we're going to stop it but patients aren't going to pay for ongoing cannabis plant if it's not beneficial keep a diary i think so a good way to evaluate therapy so yes we're getting close to the end now and when i've spoken to gps and other prescribers there's always been the concern about lack of evidence and actually there is a lot of evidence and tonight's talk doesn't allow time to go through all of that but this is a quote with regard to wearing masks during the covet 19 pandemic and trisha greenhall her quote was the search for perfect evidence may be the enemy of good policy you know i've prescribed a thousand patients i've prescribed 1500 patients prescription cannabis with very few adverse effects with very encouraging direct benefits to the patient and look if there's lack of evidence i think informed consent is important but don't uh hold off waiting for perfect evidence uh i'm told that paracetamol doesn't have perfect evidence for its efficacy there are things that we prescribed that have been grandfathered into our pharmacopoeia and i think that you should be encouraged with intractable conditions with patients who are showing interest and offering consent to look at prescription cannabis i've been to a lot of talks myself and i've been inspired by a number of very wise speakers and jeffrey hergen-rather is a gp in california who's been recommending cannabis to his patients for 20 years teresa topek in sydney and uh we're going to finish for the moment on this slide but the presentation does continue with a few other slides of interest i wanted to just take a break here uh i can remind you that i do receive emails with questions and i'm pretty good at getting back to you sometimes not the same day and i'm happy to take referrals and offer advice on patient treatment but uh look over to you helen i'll stop here and uh invite questions thank you graeme if that's okay we've got a number of questions that have come through um there's been quite a few questions along whether you could comment on the impact of drug testing within workplaces industry or with driving if you're using any of these products okay drug testing pretty much looks for thc or the metabolites and so our experience and congratulations to any others who have been prescribing cbd this experience is likely to set patients up for negative drug screens though there are a whole range of drug testing kits and i'm not familiar with all and i can't guarantee that all will show a negative test but look we put patients on morphine we put them on benzos and i hope if the needs arise and i've certainly done this i've written covering letters for employers and really impairment is the issue and with driving again the current test is impairment and patients are certainly taking something like the the sativex uh using the spray and even older patients are telling me that in the right dose they're getting relief from pain as an unapproved use of side effects and are not feeling impaired and i certainly think it's important that we ask patients to assess themselves uh ask your whanau am i safe to be a driver you know use that traditional test and so it's looking for signs of impairment okay thank you there is a question about are there certain pharmacies that dispense medical cannabis um someone a gp has prescribed medical cannabis recently and the chemist told the patient that it was not available it's a fairly common problem so look the the serious answer is that all doctors can prescribe to all patients particularly cbd and all pharmacies can dispense but just like many doctors have never done it and don't quite know how to do it hopefully by now you've got a bit of a clue but pharmacies uh who don't have an account with the various wholesalers or you know it's the first time we do anything isn't it it takes way longer and sometimes the inclination is to say no no that's not my scope of practice well uh yes there are pharmacies and i i think probably email me i'm just concerned that if i mention the name of two or three pharmacies uh there'll be some that i've overlooked and uh certainly i'm familiar with pharmacies in auckland hamilton and wellington who have shown enthusiasm for dispensing and look do email me see it there doctor at cannabiscare.nz okay thank you graeme is there a conversion chart between cbd products and codeine or tramadol or opioids in general is there a switching guide can they be taken together do we need to be converting these uh no is there a conversion chart from codeine to morphine or tremendous to morphine uh look there are some charts in that area but it really is titration and one of the things that i've learned and have been doing is uh when people start on a when i prescribe them a cvd product for instance and they're on a bunch of medicines i say carry on with your standard medicines add the cbd and try that first and if you find that there's less pain less anxiety or you're you're getting some symptomatic relief then reduce some of your medicines start to taper them down for those with a preference just to continue with the cbd only so it's all titration but no i don't convert the dose of codeine to cbd or thc or the combination i uh yeah you you understand i think that i add the cbd the prescription cannabis and then if things are working take away the original item if the patient prefers not to be on codeine and experience constipation every day great thank you i think that was one of the other comments was specific gi side effects that you can have with our cbd products where someone has had lots of trouble with constipation with their um opioid products that they've been using it's interesting one of the potential adverse effects from cbd is loose bowel motions and i get people singing the praises of it but it doesn't happen with everyone and of course uh for those who wish to taper off their opioids uh this may be a safer option with fewer adverse effects thank you and actually graeme i've had a few comments um that have come in about the um dispensing from pharmacies and and the general um consensus is that a lot of the uh certain products have been out of stock for several months uh and that the more expensive brands have been generally available but there are definitely um a lot of pharmacies that have had brands out of stock from the manufacturer so just as a comment back to that question that's quite right we have had supply chain issues i mentioned that from the first of april we're in the six-month transition and companies were advised to get in enough product to cover that period and then the new regulations will start after transition it's been quite challenging for importers all our products at the moment are imported and some companies have run out and other companies that may have more expensive products in some cases continue to have supplies we don't know from the 1st of october the ministry hasn't explained what the situation is going to be i wish i could tell you a lot more about how the future is going to be but uh no there's quite a delay in the system thanks graeme okay i've got a further question about set of x are we allowed to prescribe side effects without special authority even if it's not for ms symptoms yeah and uh so that was a great change from the 1st of april and i've got i've started over 100 patients on the sativex and really for me uh those are the two options cbd or sativex or a combination and some will take their uh their cbd in the morning and their sativex in the evening because the thc is more sedating and find their own sort of balance in future we're hoping to have different blends of cbd thc where the the same medicine through the day will do the job okay and if a cbd product has been approved for prescribing by a different specialist can another doctor or gp continue to prescribe it based off that authority or do they have to go back to the original specialist so cbd we can all prescribe we don't need to fill out an application form for the combined products with more than two percent thc apart from sativex so we've got certavex and cbd easy anyone no forms required write your prescription control drug form for side effects but for other combinations and there are uh 25 milligrams per ml of thc is available and 10 10 which is 10 milligrams per ml of thc and cbd each but that requires an application to be sent to the ministry of health and they are saying that specialist gps are not eligible to apply and i would still argue that we are often better placed than non-gp specialists but uh yeah we're in a very difficult situation there okay there's been a few questions graeme about um and i'm not sure whether you're able to comment on this about nurse practitioner prescribing of medical or medicinal cannabis and whether that is something that you know more about you can make a comment on actually i don't know you've got me there that's fine uh there are also some concerns about um how whether you need to wean off these products or whether there is we should be worried about um ceasing them suddenly and if we did cease it suddenly what kind of side effects or response would we look for in our patients so i'm a gp and i also trained as an addiction specialist and sometimes think of myself as dr taper because i'm always tapering off various medications tapering is the safe way but with cbd plenty of people report that they've stopped it suddenly and three days later notice the recurrence of symptoms it's like a lot of things isn't a human behavior you take something you feel better and then you forget to take it and a few days later the symptoms recur and you think oh that's what i need to do go back on it so cbd uh very unlikely to get any discontinuation or withdrawal symptoms but thc i might be a little bit more cautious of course if it's associated with dysphoria or tachycardia or hyperemesis then you you would want to stop it's uh abruptly though you could taper and find if there is a a lower safe dose okay uh how soon or how what timeline do you give for reviewing your patients for effect after initiation and how high do you go yeah look good question so i write a script and i put a repeat on it and ask people to get back to me in a month for a follow-up my practice is to use a conventional specialist model i'll write to the gp at the first visit and at follow-up a lot of patients self-refer because they're uncomfortable discussing it with their gp and i always get their permission before i write back to the gp but i'm quite keen to educate and to explain what we're doing what the dose is how it's going and hand over to gps and be available if there are questions from the gp okay um grammar's ear adjustment or any adjustment that you need to think of in the setting of chronic kidney disease or liver disease right um yes so i see the patient and then a month later do a follow-up and [Music] and so repeat prescriptions i can do after that without further visits the follow-up's also a chance if there is a concern perhaps about their liver um to have organized some lfts and just make sure that their liver is okay uh renal excretion of cannabis uh is a low issue uh so most of it's excreted by the liver and you might be concerned about the the liver function so renal function probably not an issue particularly with cbd but start low go slow and if you're concerned run off some lfts just as i'll run off inrs for those on warfarin or ask the patient to do their tests more often there are some papers suggesting an association with liver dysfunction and cbd uh i think that's unlikely from the overseas experts i've spoken to so i don't routinely check the liver for my patients on prescription cannabis okay and in the elderly so i guess you know on one side you're talking about renal and liver disease and the elderly where they are at high risk of falls or unsteadiness on their feet do you have um increased concern about prescribing something like set effects which has one of the side effects of of sedation yeah i would probably start with cbd because of its good safety profile and even start really cautiously um i often start with one drop qid and then day two two drops qid and just gradually build it up to six or seven drops which is about uh this is a hundred milligrams per mill my favorite standard prescription and build it up uh and so i've prescribed pro for children under a year of age cerebral palsy with severe spasms that are causing pain and the oldest patient last month was a 99 year old and you know go cautiously and i think cbd is very safe and as we said earlier add the thc increases the risk of adverse effects graeme are you able to comment on um tolerance and addiction we've had a number of questions coming around the potential for tolerance and the potential for addiction with these prescription products yeah in theory tolerance uh can occur but uh that that can be the same with uh you know i'm like a lot of gps uh i prescribe methadone and our methadone patients find that they stabilize on a certain level even though we know that opioid tolerance is a real thing and often we can use many medicines and find that there is a plateau where the dose is right so the same with cannabis but if tolerance does develop and people say look this dose was working i was taking 200 milligrams a day and after three months it stopped working the idea is to have a prescription cannabis holiday and to stop uh to reset your cb1 and cb2 receptors over two or three days over a weekend and many people find that they can safely do that but curiously most people don't seem to develop a tolerance and with that are you aware of any studies on long-term use of cbd and thc uh no and uh look in my own practice i've said that i see people and then follow up in a month so uh i'm not always getting a long term picture but increasingly i've had people who've come to me for their prescriptions over a year or two and don't seem to have adverse effects often they find that chronic pain or anxiety does seem to gradually recede and they can use a smaller dose so um long-term studies uh sad effects has a lot more literature which is why it's approved for ms even though we might be using it off label but it took them 15 years to develop it and get it through the uk ministry of health and they had to show things like a lack of addiction potential from sativex before the uk ministry of health allowed them to market it through the pharmacies on prescription okay thank you there's a question here graeme do you think prescribing cbd will still be in demand if the cannabis referendum passes and will these products become cheaper to buy yeah the referendum then you know once again with my addiction specialist had harm reduction i'd much rather my patients went to a store in future and purchased a product that had been tested for strength and for contaminants and was safe in those respects rather than patients these days saying well your prescription cannabis is unaffordable i'll go back to my green fairy or my drug dealer or i just have to stop because i don't know where to purchase cannabis so currently people are and it's a good question to ask patients are you using cannabis and the classic answer is when younger and we know that peak use age of cannabis is 20s and it tapers off in the 30s legalizing cannabis it's going to be the same deal it's going to be safer for the people in their 20s and perhaps 30s to purchase a product that has been tested for safety now uh i gave a talk at a public meeting at late 2019 and someone in the audience put his hand up and said can you tell me any form of cannabis use that's not medicinal and uh by that he meant well you know if someone has a glass of sauvignon blanc is that medicinal if it just calms them down and relaxes them at the end of the day so you know there is this crossover between adult use and medicinal use and so i think people will always want to treat themselves and take charge of their own program and try something at a shop with legalized cannabis should this be allowed and that price may be cheaper than something we can prescribe it's a long way off let's say the referendum succeeds then it has to be passed into law and a labor greens government would look at doing that other parties may not and then setting up systems i can imagine it's going to be 6 12 months before anything's out there so uh we're going to be the prescribers it's the doctors and the drug dealers who are the source of cannabis until we uh have a legal and a controlled system okay thank you graeme there's been a few questions about uh are there a is there an age limit as in what is the youngest age you would prescribe cbd products to uh and can you comment on the suggestion that cannabis can affect brain development in teenagers or young patients okay uh yeah let's break that up so the first part of it was an age limit and you know i prescribe benzos and opioids and a zero age limit well you know a child in pain who's experiencing a cancer will be given opioids or a child with seizures an infant with seizures will be given benzos we weigh this up and the same applies to prescription cannabis once again to repeat cbd appears to be a very safe option and i think it is likely to be safe for all age groups with thc if you need better pain relief better sedation start low go slow and i have had children with pain from tumors undergoing cancer treatment who have been on side effects as well or have been lucky enough to get to the balance preparation with equal thc and cbd and that often does help to deal with their pain and these are kids with desperate outlooks and so the question about brain development i think cbd is unlikely to affect brain development and further to that i would say that my young people with autism or severe anxiety or tourettes i think the anxiety is more likely to cause a kind of brain damage and if i can relieve that with the cbd i think i'm doing far more good than the any unknown risks at thc well yes in severe situations you might consider that but while we know that brain development occurs up until the age of 25 the dunedin and the christchurch studies have shown that the risk of psychosis from illicit cannabis which is likely to be high or dominant and thc is in those kids who smoke cannabis heavily before the age of 18. those who are less commonly using it or start at a later age in their young adulthood are very likely to be affected i think a family history would give me concern but you know i mentioned the antipsychotic effects of cbd i my understanding is that if someone is psychotic smoking cannabis actually gives them a relief from the tyranny of psychosis that changes it and it's it's understandable that they might want to do something like that psychiatrists will argue that it's not terribly helpful for them but but when we're stuck uh we we try things to to shift out of that and so brain development we don't know for sure uh up till the age of 18 i might have some concern with a strong family history or certainly a personal history of psychosis with regard to the thc but with cbd it seems to be a safe option great thank you graeme i think there's one last question here which i think we have time for which is just can you comment about the intermittent use of cbd um and what effects that has for people who are start and stop and what is the intended duration of treatment yeah uh what we're treating and if you go back to the list that i talked about the kind of problems these are chronic problems and uh so chronic pain and emotional distress that to name the predominant ones fibromyalgia and anxiety for example patients will say that they treat those and often feel over time a degree of benefit and don't need such a big dose and forget doses and then um you know patients tend to take a prn and they they take treatment as required and in a way that's a good thing and for many patients uh they'll like that the affordability i'll share this with you an oncologist told me that the main side effect of medicinal cannabis is financial toxicity and with financial toxicity uh taking it as needed our patients do this with many things that we prescribe and uh you know they they're sensible often about it uh you know when it comes to their antihypertensives it becomes a challenge for us to tell them to take it every day and not when they feel as needed but you know with some medicines uh uh you know the amep resolve that people will drop in and drop out of treatment there and i think the same applies for prescription cannabis and to a large extent uh there's 10 000 years of experience of people using cannabis for all sorts of health problems and if it should be legalized under a controlled system where people can go to a store and purchase it they're going to take it when they need it and avoid it at other times and they'll do that with our prescriptions as well thank you graeme and thank you for a really informative presentation there i think there's lots of information uh with dosing and in terms of approaching some of those questions that people have had those slides of grains presentation will be on the goodfellow website within the next 24-48 hours so you'll be able to go back through them and refer to some of the slides that graham has i think especially around the dosing and the approach to titrating which i think are really useful so thank you very much graeme welcome and good evening everyone
FafWoViXimc,Nimbin Medican - Educating Australians About Medical Cannabis,2020-01-28T00:35:17Z,vibrated from the north you know what is now India alright can we go okay good on you for coming thank you very much for coming seriously the rain is just fantastic for us for all of you that's the most rain with any you I reckon so you might have helped make that happen but how many people never been to a medic an I so appreciate you coming all the weather and all and I hope you have a really good day or weekend or so Andrew come up here so my name is Michael from I'm president of the help embassy here this is Andrew and the hemp party secretary of the hemp party a big part of the hemp embassy also and just just to you know more than half the people what do you've never been here so appreciate everyone coming and trekking through the water and usually that store would be outside there's a selection of books there and info if you do get time to go up town the hemp embassy next to the pub has lots of books and info and more stuff but generally it's tricky today cuz some of you will not know much about cannabis and some of you all know a lot so feel free to ask questions feel free to talk to the various doctors and different people when you get a chance yourself there'll be plenty of room for that but we started the hip embassy it will be our 28th mark we have an annual cannabis chloroform gathering and rally on the first weekend of May every year and that'll be the next time we really get together for medical talks first second and third of May but we started the hemp embassy nearly 30 years ago after a really bad year of helicopter raids where you kind of feel like the police users's practice in a way you know that's pretty scary helicopters over your house and people in military uniform just about nine ropes and looking for dark plants like they're terrorists things by themselves just about but you know over time we build up lots of knowledge and then people kept coming to us looking for help to find medicine and you know if you think you can help someone feel better I kind of reckon you've got an obligation to just do it anyway so we're a nonprofit organization maybe that's protected us from the police a little bit but we've had a few police raids but generally I would say New South Wales Police are using discretion more than Queensland Police I think anyway Andrew my mate here he's got involved on the legal side of medical cannabis and knows much more about it than me got licenses to export and import and seeds and and he's got a had licences to grow hemp and medical cannabis trials but you know we're still seen as the weirdos I think oh hi I'm Andrea vassilis from Nina man hemp embassy secretary of the Australian hemp party and yeah involved in a couple of medical cannabis enterprises and and hemp seed food advocate and this delimit med cans I've been involved from the start obviously with the hemp embassy I like them because a lot of the you know a lot of people are coming they've never been to nimbin before and it's not the big it's not a big city one or anything like that they're not talking to you know overseas highfalutin professors with all this you know scientific knowledge the nimbin med can is all about what people are doing on the street you know what the normal people how they're getting by with medical cannabis you know medical cannabis that has been you know by and large ninety nine percent of medical cannabis has grown to black-market specifications whether it's here in Australia or or in the US or Canada you know these rules and regulations around you know GMP and these are all you you know it's not and it's not really taking off in a big way overseas so you know that the mid cans important for that and that's what people see and also you know there is that chance that they get the correct information and and what I do nowadays that this maid can is warn people about the the immense amount of misinformation there is about medical cannabis nowadays the other point we're trying to make is that you know high-profile advocates around medical cannabis don't really understand the issues you know we we're not even the debate hasn't matured in Australia we're still not talking about the overarching United Nations drug treaties that are keeping medical cannabis really you know at bay that's why government's going on three four years now of legal medical cannabis and yet there's still nothing but complaints very few people are accessing it in terms of you know the overall population so what we're seeing is a huge increase in the black market of medical cannabis and that that's a worry for us because you know by now we would have thought that you know government would have spoken to the hemp party the hemp embassy we know what's going on no use talking to people who don't understand supply the introduction of how medical cannabis came about in other countries what is medical cannabis so you know Medi can and these med can and being from nimbin here is important because when people do come here if you do find the right person you will get the right answers you will be bought into the picture in the meantime I tell people question everything and even even if you you know you do come to nimbin and you hear this or that I would still question it we say you know go use Google use the internet but really look at really good well well-defined testimonials of people so I think the med cans will continue on into the future I think there will be more influential and hopefully the hemp party will be more influential in terms of genuine medical cannabis law reform here in Australia our big advice for people who've never tried cannabis before is start low go slow you start really low you don't ever give yourself a fright you might totally love it you might not like it and you'll hear from a lot of people today especially doctor part he'll say everyone is different and this where it sort of beats the pharmaceutical industry there isn't a standard dose to give everybody we are all different we all have an endocannabinoid system only discovered 40 years ago and we all have different we just all have a different reaction I really appreciate how individual we all learn and I think like Andrew said you you have to trust yourself be your own doctor everyone should google their ailment and medical cannabis and you'll find so much information it's confusing so hopefully today people will help you be not too confused and there's three doctors all with experience in cannabis going to be around over the weekend there's Malcolm Lee who's a longtime breeder and grower of cannabis and been through the courts and got himself out of it well and very open people here will began to talk to you about anything so don't be shy so first P speaker is dr. Deb Waldron from Queensland she I've known dr. Deb for a while she's been coming to these medications regularly and she will juggle had some of you know lots and some of you know nothing but I think I can say that she's been a cannabis user for a long time as well as a doctor and now starting herbalism so she explained her effort to manage your own pain that's really led you along the path of learning hasn't it dr. Jim I'm not saying any more thanks for being hi I'm dr. Debbie Waldron I was a rural GP said we years ago but I'm also a cancer survivor I got melanoma around the same time as I stopped practicing medicine and I'd like to say that cannabis was what cured me but it was dendritic cell therapy in Germany cannabis just helped me in many other ways and almost certainly slowed the growth of that cancer but we're not here to talk about that today we're here to celebrate the Medicare workshops this is something that's been going for a few years and I've been privileged enough to give talks here for the last few years these workshops were set up to educate the public about medical cannabis to try and get rid of some of the reefer madness ideas that are still prevalent today to make it easier for people to find out about medical cannabis and to ultimately you know find out ways to access medical cannabis you know just through networking and things like that so the reason I became involved is because I'm a compulsive talker the starters I can basically took the leg off an iron pot and the more I learned about cannabis medicine the more I realized that this was a new and exciting field of medicine that doctors had been denied and I just felt that it was really really important to get the word out there if not to doctors initially but to the general public so I sort of just slipped quite easily into the habit of coming to nimbin every three months to talk at the workshops I also do talks at muddy grass and the same thing is really just you Kate the public on medical cannabis but the other secondary reason it's not just the talks that are given but there's now a few doctors attending the workshops and it gives people a chance to talk to a doctor about it - perhaps explore why it's so hard for other GPS to write prescriptions you know one of the things that are stopping GPS from writing prescriptions other doctors can at least help people to understand that a bit better as well as you know sort of being the cautionary voice in this sometimes once the cannabis is extracted it becomes a medicine whether people like that idea or not and though you can get adverse effects from smoking or vaping cannabis those effects are usually more short-lived whereas the adverse effects you can get from ingesting cannabis and such as edibles the these cases lead to quite decent toxicity because people for example don't wait for it to take effect before they take another dose so it really helps to have a doctor's input especially when you're wanting to use cannabis for conditions that require high levels of THC especially activated so we act as a cautionary voice as well I don't know I think I think it it helps people to be able to talk face-to-face with a doctor as well I think it helps to dispel the thing that we're all complete ourselves because not all of us are and and I think I've learned a lot I've learned a lot about why you know why people do come to these workshops and it is invariably for help isn't very for a loved one or themselves and they have all done some research before they come here but I'm actually astounded by how many new people are in every audience every three months because we always ask that question and it's always the majority of the audience I think we've become a bit of an institution now in the cannabis scene in our quest for legislation the Medicaid workshops are becoming better and better known and I feel very privileged to have to be a part of that and I hope to continue for quite a long time yet my name's Steve bolt I'm a solicitor in Lismore which is not very far away from nimbin I'm here today at the ready can seminar to give advice to people about the legal status about medicinal cannabis which is sort of a little bit legal of mostly not there's a all sorts of complicated regulations which allow some people to go through a process to get the or prescriptions most people the great majority of people who use medicinal cannabis are not able to do that for all sorts of complicated reasons so we're here today early to give advice about how that works a little bit and in particular I suppose to talk about the impact of people on the drive with the driving laws there's it's an offense to drive a car in all states these days with the presence of THC in saliva the police do a saliva test and we're talking about the the way that works the consequences for people I think the takeaway message I hope that people got from my talk was in the context of things yes it might be illegal to use medicinal cannabis but make your own decision about what is good for your milk for your physical health possibly your mental health make your own decisions about the medicinal effect of cannabis for very very many people it's a very effective medicine and more effective than other products available through pharmaceutical companies and so on so even though you might be breaking the law put that into the context of their health benefits that come from breaking the law and what are the chances of being caught and punished by the police and the courts probably pretty low really and in a similar way driving with the presence of THC in your saliva sure that's against the law many many people will not be tested because of the way the police conduct their tests because the police will simply choose not to and in if you are tested and found positive go to court the magistrate is depending on your driving record etc possibly more likely than not to be lenient enough to allow you to keep your license it's a big thing that people worry about losing their license if they can stop by police big thing and hopefully will people's mind arrest a little bit today we're saying the reality is chances are low which would be caught and if you are caught chances are low that you will actually lose your license i'm carol island I'm the CEO and the managing director of epilepsy action Australia an organisation that provides services and support for people who are affected with epilepsy right across the country a lot of people with epilepsy have unrelenting seizures that aren't controlled by the normal antiepileptic medications that are available and a lot of people are looking to medical cannabis as an option to try to help control their seizures I've been to the medic an symposiums or seminars as we might call them on a couple of occasions I've met a lot of people here with epilepsy and up with people with other health conditions as well and we're trying to help them to navigate the various processes in Australia that are around seeking medical medical cannabis as a treatment option for their condition it's been great to talk to people who are interested they're having difficulty sometimes with access they're wanting to understand exactly why medical cannabis might help them and so we're trying to educate in terms of the endocannabinoid system and various reasons why they may in fact have an endocannabinoid deficiency there's a lot to work out Australia's got a lot to learn we're still on the edge of research and the medic and symposiums actually seek to give people some balanced and genuine understanding of this whole situation [Music] dr. Andrew cattle heiress and here we are at medicham meeting at nimbin I've been attending Medicare meetings for some years now the fact that they're so well attended really attests to the failings of the current allopathic medical system it's a very valuable opportunity both for the patients or the prospective patients to learn what is available across the broad range of cannabis therapeutics and from the herbal providers to improve both the delivery of a product and the product themselves so it's a very valuable two-way learning experience even though there have been some legal developments in the provision of medical cannabis the fact remains that the pharmaceutical cannabis is both very expensive and at times quite prohibitively expensive and also very limited in the range of products that are being offered to patient one thing that anyone has been involved with medical cannabis for any period of time knows it's a therapeutic that needs to be applied in a very individualized way there's no one-size-fits-all there's no one dose for everyone and at these medicham meetings so I said there is a two-way interaction between the patients and the carers and providers that we find invaluable and is essential for improving the overall results that we will be getting now and in the future today dr. John Tay here a medical director of plant med medicinal cannabis clinic and we're based in Brisbane Australia and I'm here today at Medi can it's a quarterly conference put on by the nimman community to educate people about medicinal cannabis it's one of my favorite little meetings of the year and people are always so receptive to the amazing information which I have to share with them I always run through the basics of THC as a medicine and CBD as a medicine and I love to answer questions that people may have and everyone always got specific questions for themselves so often your question is relevant to other people's questions as well so I'd love to answer those questions for you hamed is a medicinal cannabis clinic which has been operating in Brisbane now for over a year and we've had over a thousand patients legally approved for medicinal cannabis use so come on down to medicham it's a lovely place the people are friendly and you can get some great education about the use of medicinal cannabis and how it can benefit you and your life thanks I'm dr. Tay hi my name is Caroline what why I'm here at the medic end and why I give up my Saturday and Sunday four times a year to come and do this is because it's a great education for people who don't know a lot about it you often need points to be able to hang on points in history real facts to be able to understand what the war on drugs is about and cannabis in particular is a master plan and if you look into the history of cannabis you realize it's been used medicine and as a whole lot of things feel fiber now it can be used as plastics it's it's just an incredible thing and so we call that a master plant and it's worth fighting for the master plants and cannabis as medicine is really what Medicare is all about or mostly about and I think that you need to get educated on on really the idea that being at peace and in harmony with mother nature treating yourself with the best plant medicine with with the kind of your your best idea of how your body actually works treating your body like a temple treating the earth like a temple we're very lucky to be here and and we can't deny that the plants and the trees and the mountains have everything to do with our survival so yeah cannabis is just super important to me because of particularly in the last decade the health effects that we've seen and and it's undeniable even though most of it's anecdotal it doesn't mean that it didn't happen you know a lot of history that's written is not true anyway whereas we can see from talking to people and switching people on that they actually get switched on to a much bigger picture and it's more about our connection with nature and our connection with spirit and understanding the truth about why we're here and what our purpose is and that it's a beautiful thing welcome to my store my name is Gerald I'm the proprietor and only daily in the village we're making anything to do with cannabis me personally I've been working for the cannabis plant for the last 40 years on a full-time basis and she's my boss she tells me what to do and this is it cosmetic use rubbing on the hemp balm which is a rather marvelous marvelous thing everything we do is legal everything we do is for the good of either the person or the planet and we've stumbled across some some really marvelous uses this is juicing it just going through a cold-pressed juicer take it fairly slowly and we're getting about 40 percent juice per plant weight from our material and it's marvelous we have to mix it down with a little bit of apple juice or something to keep the flavor good untapped this one here it's an untapped resource absolutely marvelous think about think of wheatgrass or that kind of nutrient value only with this you've got the low range precursor cannabinoids as well which are just excellent for you wonderful homeostasis which is balancing the body balancing is digestive system doing it all quite naturally and with no high or intoxication whatsoever and don't waste the waste this here the waste is just pure fiber you can make a beautiful plastic plastic out of that you can make all kinds of and the chickens love it Fiji chickens with that it will give you nice - yellow coloured eggs [Music] and this is the juice completely non intoxicating no cannibal no one THC of any kind in there at all delicious delicious you can taste the goodness [Music] cheers folks you're doing a beautiful job this here is tea it makes a very nutty very full flavored natural tea again no intoxication whatsoever quite delicious and you make it the same way as you do ki you add hot water let it steep for 10 minutes and drink it beautiful we have that in a tea bag too of course this is all made from the industrial hemp plant so that tests out to be less than 1% THC in the plant and that's what keeps it legal the only difference between hemp and cannabis is the percentage of tetrahydrocannabinol or THC that you'll find in the plant so this is the long fiber from the plant incredibly useful from that we've been making this here which is Martin earnings baby the local inventor this is magnesium hemlock it replaces concrete and it's a carbon sink so rather than burning carbon and releasing carbon in your building products we're now absorbing them into the building product and sequestering them forever fireproof weatherproof it's got it all this is this is a building block of the future and it will drive the whole building industry into becoming a carbon sink so instead of producing carbon we're now sequestering it my name is Malcolm Lee I'm a plant breeder I'm a grower I teach people how to make feminized seeds I teach people how to change the cannabinoid cannabinoid profile of all of the plants that they want to plant it's most important that you come to this to this medical conference because our whole concept of medicine has been changed over the last 100 years we have an internal cannabis system and it is responsible for 80% of our homeostasis homeostasis being that balance in your body which allows you to carry on for a long long time you do that by having a great smile on her face from the time that you were born until the time that you would that time that you died to actually achieve a smile on your face for that length of time is quite difficult however if you exercise you eat properly you have good sex you have all of the things which are gonna put the smile on your face you'll last a long long time if you sit down and eat your McDonald's or your KFC and your coca-cola and watch your TV for the rest of your life your endocannabinoid system gets depressed and in the end it gets to a point of endocannabinoid deficiency you will start getting disease and when you keep going you will get to a point where there's an endocannabinoid wilting point just like a plant has a wilting point you cannot come back from that point you cannot so you want to keep that endocannabinoid system strong the interesting thing is that the or internal cannabis an and amide to AG is completely the same electromagnetically as a named amide or to AG so your body does not distinguish between your internal cannabis and the cannabis from a plant if the internal cannabis makes you well so does the external cannabis I had 700 people I was supplying cannabis to before I got busted I supposed to go to jail for 33 years and nine months but the judge actually said that I should carry on say guess what he gave me a wink see if you get here you increase your knowledge and you do your own research do your own research because this is how it is every cannabinoid and every person who takes cannabis cannabis doesn't know whether it's working properly you have to be your own doctor you have to do you have to decide whether you eat a certain amount of day or take the oil a certain amount a day what type of oil with its high in CBD cbc data that you have to figure it out so come to the cannabis workshop and find out and do your own research please hi my name is edwin canaan and I'm from Melbourne originally from the Netherlands and I'm here in nimbin to this special event and where basically I like to learn more about the medicinal purpose of the hemp plant I think it's such a versatile plant and not only for a medicinal purpose but obvious also for industrial purpose and this event here where I am right now is giving me further insights about how this plan can be used for epilepsy or people perhaps with cancer but also goes more into I suppose the specifics how you can apply it why it might not work for everybody and we have all cannabinoid system and they're just discovering more and more about this and so am I I recommend anybody to be honest who wants to do something for Humanity and wants to do something for the earth to get involved and that's why I'm here today everyone calls me sister I've been doing the membered medicham for a couple of years now pretty much from the beginning and you can watch it all on YouTube just search nimbin medical and you'll find hundreds of videos for lawyers doctors health professionals patients from all around Australia covering all sorts of diseases I'm particularly interested in medical cannabis and also the legalization of cannabis as a plant and as hem along with my other colleagues we promote these educational forums and conferences to be attended by patients medical health professionals health professionals and laypeople like you so do come I have a health professional background going back 30 years in the medical industry and there is no doubt that the medical benefits of cannabis CBD THC they're undisputed in treating trauma and illnesses of all kind so really I think you need to be part of the session and you need to come we're very friendly and everyone benefits from cannabis including the little ones hi I'm David Hyatt I am the proprietor of the lemon bush theatre this is my beautiful staff who I am so in honor off from today's actions with the American rally we are the regular host of the Medicare rallies and we see that as being a really an important event on the calendar of nimbin many people come from all over Australia predominantly to share information and to gain some some thoughts on healing education law all sorts of different facets of the of the marijuana industry my team of beautiful people who who just love being in service and sharing their joy and their happiness with everybody also is very healing and nimman itself as as a center where people come to share the love and we're happy to work to be a part of the whole process yeah I'm Thunder cloud riparian aka James Arthur Warren and I'm a nimbin artist poet and very passionate cannabis activists last year I one of these medicham workshops I wrote the following poem and I'd love to share it with you so here we go if you were the parent of a child who was sick would you give cannabis to son named dick if you were the wife of a man with cancer would you give cannabis as a life in hand and what about if you're a doctor and you knew a queue of pharmaceutical poisons or a herb that's pure it's time that the days of prohibition would past free up the herb and free up the healing grass and if a healing herb heals not harms why is it that the government twists our arms because the earth gives plants for people to heal and eat so why is cannabis stopped from growing in my garden and in the street and if the drug war harms people every day let's end prohibition today and ending if ending prohibition will harm minimize let's do it totally without any license regulation or disguise because it's time with the days of prohibition were passed free up the healing herb and free up the grass because cannabis makes its users feel well and locking up users is abuse and as hell and if we end the drug war we could help out their people and end the big pharmaceutical evil we could grow our own cannabis in our own homes and we could drink it and juice it and just maybe smoke a few cones because it's time that the days of prohibition were passed free up the healing herb and free up the grass because cannabis enhances performance and brains and prohibition is only causing many millions of people pains and if cannabis were made to be grown and made legal we could end the poisonous alcohol evil and if we end prohibition at the end of the day there be less crime gangs less pain less police yes and all those criminal elements just fade away we end we want to call all politicians we need to give them a reason and we can end prohibition this growing season before 420 2020 let's do it I'm thunder cloud washing away the garbage and leaving behind rainbows see you later dad ha ha I'm just laughing at the dog barking in the background you got

GSSUs6ugWw4,All Medical Cannabis Patients To Be Able To Drive Legally In Victoria Shortly (while not impaired),2020-10-14T21:05:44Z,hi everybody my name's rhys cohen i'm a cannabis consultant and i'm here with holly talking about the recently announced upcoming changes to medical cannabis driving laws in victoria thanks for joining us rhys so what are the current laws about cannabis and driving in australia well cannabis is both a prescribed medicine and an illegal drug and across australia it is not you're not allowed to have any cannabis in your system when you're driving a car so the police will conduct random roadside tests and they'll test for the presence of thc which is one of the impairing ingredients in cannabis and if the police can identify that you have some thc in your system then that is an offense it doesn't matter how impaired you are or whether it's a medicine or a recreational substance that's the law so that's the situation at the moment okay so how does that impact the types of medications that patients in australia prescribed well the police when they conduct random roadside drug tests they're looking for the presence of thc specifically so what this means is you know patients who are concerned about needing to drive even while they are taking their prescribed medication they're probably going to be more likely to go for a pure cbd product as opposed to something that contains a little bit of thc just to avoid those risks with the roadside tests and sometimes that may not be the best medication for them it might be more appropriate to use a thc containing product but because of the risk and the concern they go for a product that might not be as effective as they are entitled to okay that makes sense so give us a background on some of the efforts to change the medicinal cannabis and driving laws yeah well there's been a lot i mean this has been an issue that we've known about since medical cannabis was legalized several years ago we've had you know advocates like united in compassion scientists and scientific groups like the lambert initiative for cannabinoid therapeutics and then of course most recently and and most successfully so far fiona patton and the reason party okay so fiona's proposal to change the law has been given a green light what does that mean at this point well so fiona's proposal is that people who are legally prescribed at cannabis medication should be entitled to the same legal treatment as people who are prescribed any other type of medication so my understanding is that her proposal would allow someone who has been who isn't impaired who was stopped randomly by the police who was tested positive for the presence of thc in their system if they have a current and valid prescription demonstrating that they are taking a legally prescribed medication then they are not in violation of the law in the same way that someone who's tested positive for the presence of opiates would present their prescription for opiates and say i wasn't impaired this is my medication um and the police will wave them on but that's the intended outcome it'll take us a few months to get there um at the moment the victorian government has announced that they're putting together a bit of a working group to uh to really um nut out the specifics on what this will look like and how it will work and they're expected to report back on their on their on their thoughts and consultation in two months time at the end of the year and then after that i imagine there will be some draft legislation and then hopefully this law will be will be reformed early 2021. okay great so how do you think this will impact the rest of the country then well hopefully this will be a bit of a wake-up call because at the moment in other places and still in victoria but you know especially in other places around australia people who are legally prescribed medical cannabis are discriminated against in law as opposed to people who are prescribed literally any other prescription medication it is the only prescription medication that that isn't afforded the defense of i was taking what my doctor prescribed to me and i wasn't impaired um so i hope and and and we should we should be aiming for uh widespread reform uh copying victoria's model um it's a sensible reasonable um and ethical um thing to do and every state and territory should follow suit okay great um thanks for that overview today reese we really appreciate it no worries

_R1d7xte1-8,Everything You Need To Know About Cannabis &amp; Driving. Explained by Tom Arkell,2020-08-24T23:25:12Z,my name is tom arkell i'm a research coordinator with the lambert initiative for cannabinoid therapeutics at the university of sydney and i'm here today with honolee to talk about how cannabis affects your driving ability and when it's safe to drive after using cannabis cannabis does affect your ability to drive yes um its effects are not extreme so they're similar to what you might expect to see with a dry in a driver with a blood alcohol concentration i'm about 0.05 so what the legal limit but one of the key differences between cannabis and alcohol is the drivers who are under the influence of cannabis tend to be aware of this and they often try to compensate for this so they do things like driving more slowly more carefully of course just because you're conscious that your driving might be impaired doesn't preclude the fact that you actually might be impaired but it does show that the effects of cannabis on driving are in some ways quite subtle and quite different to the effects of alcohol which we often use as the reference drug in drug driving research just because of the fact that it's legal and because you are allowed to drive with a certain amount of it in your system the thc can affect your driving abilities so studies show that thc can impair various functions that are quite important for driving so things like divided attention being able to focus on multiple things as you're driving and processing speed so how quickly you can take in incoming information and respond to that appropriately and we do see impairment during voice simulator and on-road driving as well and this seems to last for about three to four hours following vaporized cannabis so in the simulator study we saw in him at three and a half hours still whereas on in the on-road study we saw that that seems to have disappeared by 45 miles so this suggests that probably four hours is about the window of impairment um that we might expect to see following cannabis vaporized cannabis and would expect similar results with smoke cannabis either of the inhaled routes which tend to produce pretty similar sort of pattern of effects but probably not but at this stage we're not entirely sure so in our recent on-road driving study in the netherlands we found that vaporized cbd so cbd dominant cannabis um didn't impair real-world driving and this is the first evidence we have that cbd probably doesn't impair driving um but we don't know for sure whether the same is true for cbd oils for example now this is something that the lambda initiative is currently looking into in another clinical trial so the only concerns might be with really high doses of cbd that they may be mildly sedating there is some evidence for this while it's probably unlikely that this would translate into driving impairment we just don't know totally for sure yeah so what we see is there may be some sort of differences in um in in house in the effects of cannabis containing different amounts of thc and cbd so the idea that cbd may actually sort of affect the the higher the nature of the high a little bit what we see is that may really only be um there for the first half an hour or so after after vaping so when the effects of thc tend to be strongest that seems to disappear over the next hour or so and probably what's more important is the fact that we don't see any differences in the impairing effects of th of cannabis containing either just thc or thc and cbd together so this suggests that cbd probably isn't reducing the impairing effects of thc now one i suppose limitation is that we've only looked at at a one-to-one ratio of thc and cbd so it's possible you know that maybe with higher c with higher cbd to thc ratios like 10 or 20 to 1 or with higher cbd doses that we may see those effects but we we don't see it in our research well the short answer is that australian jurisdictions all have a zero tolerance approach to cannabis which means that it's illegal for you to drive if you have any thc in your system and at the moment this applies to both medical and non-medical so there's no exemption for patients that might be using cannabis for therapeutic purposes so really this means that you shouldn't be driving if you are taking a medical cannabis product that contains thc um because there is always a risk that you will still have thc in your system perhaps even even long after you no longer feel the effects of it anymore so look it really depends on how you consume it and we smoked or vaporized cannabis containing thc these effects tend to be greatest in the first two to three hours and then they typically taper off over the next couple of hours after that with oils or tinctures or edibles you see quite a different pattern of effects and a different sort of timeline so those effects may take an hour or two to kick in but then those effects can last in some cases for eight hours or longer so the advice here is really to be waiting for an absolute minimum of eight hours to be on the safe side and one of the important things to realize is these estimates are based on sort of average responses from from the clinical research we have so far um and cannabis affects everyone differently and that's why it's particularly hard to come up with with accurate estimates that fit everyone because everyone responds differently and what might be you know a particularly unimpairing dose for someone maybe a bit stronger for someone else and those effects may last for longer as well so this is is really something you know with more research we're probably not going to come up with an answer to this this is just one of the tricky things with cannabis is that everyone does respond quite differently to it and this does make it very difficult to come up with clear guidelines around how long people should wait before driving after using it it is basically as simple as thc yeah um from a legal point of view i mean that there's two offenses when it comes to cannabis and driving so one is driving well under the influence and driving while you're affected and the other offense is driving with any detectable amount of thc in your system and that's and that's really what the law specifies so the latter offense is what is targeted by roadside drug testing um so under these laws driving under the influence of cannabis really just means driving uh with any amount of detectable thc in your system and this can include a saliva blood and i think even urine it's a really tricky situation with cannabis and cannabis is is a tricky drug um with alcohol we have a fairly straightforward solution where we know breathalyzers have been really effective in reducing um the rotol that's associated with alcohol and i think if the same was true for cannabis um that we were sure that this roadside drug testing program was effective in reducing road crashes that no one would really have a problem with it the issue is more that people are being picked up as being positive for cannabis when they may not actually be impaired so i think moving forward what would be ideal is that we have more of a discussion around how else we may be able to detect impairment at the roadside i think everyone would agree that we don't want people driving on the roads if they're not safe to be driving um but we don't necessarily want to be criminalizing people for just simply having a small amount of a drug in their system a trace amount of a drug when they're not actually impaired so i think this is an issue that a lot of other countries are dealing with at the moment as well in canada and the us people are grappling with how you know how can we so come up with ways to detect just the people that are impaired um without catching a whole lot of people that may have a small amount of thc in the system um that are actually not important so i think we're going to see how this evolves over the next couple of years and and see how governments respond to this it's going to be interesting to watch thanks for joining us for today's interview about cannabis and driving

-QSesTkZ62Q,Green hopes as Australia legalises medical cannabis,2020-10-21T03:28:15Z,[Music] smoking for cannabis law reform amidst the haze this is australia's mardi gras festival in the hippie town of nimbin while smoking marijuana is illegal police tolerate the event as well as games there's serious talk surrounding the use of medical marijuana including for sick children like jai white law who has severe epilepsy the seizures are brutal he's been recessed we've performed cpr he's had a lot of brittle bones broken bones lots of eyesight and that's just not from the seizures that's from the pharmaceutical medication drivers on 35 tablets a day in a wheelchair nasal gastric fed at risk from prosecution she receives a cannabis extract produced by tony bauer used by sufferers of epilepsy multiple sclerosis cancer and other illnesses the government's always saying they're going to do something so people start researching having look and then they find me and you know i get stuck with them because the government won't do anything the mood is shifting in australia in the state of victoria children with epilepsy will be able to access the drug from next year but there is still debate on the side effects of medicinal cannabis with government reports highlighting concerns over mood swings and even links to schizophrenia companies looking to enter the market in anticipation of a relaxing of the law admit there's still a stigma attached this thing is very important that we that we make the distinction between smoking where i wanted to get high and medicine for children who are sick it's not something that you're ever going to get high off you could drink a bottle of it beyond getting high michelle wants legal protection fast for people across the country amnesty for the doctors to be able to speak up and say these are the results that this child is now getting from the cannabis stinkishes so without that you know we're just waiting for that knock at the door with several australian states getting on board with trials patients like jai may soon be able to obtain cannabis extracts on the right side of the law
51o4CHRdfls,Compass Cannabis&#39; Dave Martyn thinks Australia could be the next big medicinal market,2020-06-26T03:59:30Z,"from Canada Dave Martin and then who is bringing medicinal cameras to Australia from Canada Dave welcome thanks for having me on now it wouldn't be an initiative it wouldn't be an international hookup who didn't asked you what time it was they're just just so we go back to 1970s TV it's four o'clock in the afternoon on Thursday so a little behind Australian time fantastic but you are across Australia in time because you guys opened a clinic in Sydney last year tell us why Sydney so really the the foundation of our business we started in Canada in the medical space in 2017 and as Canada began to progressed towards recreational cannabis we looked abroad for markets that felt like they were really that the next wave and so myself and my team of co-founders we travelled to Australia in 2018 we did a medical conference there we're overwhelmed by the inquiries real true medical need and a system that we felt was gonna represent similar progress as Canada so Sydney is a market where we had an excellent physician partner we got our first clinic open there we currently also operate in the Blue Mountains and really plan to progress Melbourne is the next likely target but there's sizable medical cannabis demand across Australia today you open in Sydney you had 500 patients in the first hundred days that's a pretty good hit rate in any language medicinal cannabis Dave lots of myths and misconceptions can you tell us what it is the product and the service that you offer is sure so we were on board patients into the medical cannabis system effectively we've got education physicians that understand cannabis products really the misconception that most people have is that cannabis is for stoners it's sort of that 1960s hippie type feel to it the reality is cannabis is more about health and healing so when you consider issues like chronic pain issues around sleep cannabis oil in particular and even oils have no psychoactive effects so oils that don't get you high CBD oils is the most common example they're great for relieving chronic pain they're great for issues around sleep but there's a multitude of other issues from cancer to anxiety to anorexia that cannabis has been used to treat very effectively in North America it continues to be one of the fastest growing segments of our medicinal program in Canada and in the US and Australia is seeing in fact the fastest growth rates in the world right now for medicinal cannabis the regulations often come after the product demand is there how difficult was it to get the politicians and the legislators on board in Australia well in 2018 when we first arrived in Australia the political system wasn't ready for a larger scale rollout that said Australia's government has actually been very proactive particularly in Canada working with existing industry but also in Australia really laying the foundations for the system that exists today and even some further catalyst so CBD is likely to be reclassified in 2021 that's going to be a significant boost for that market not again that's it very much an overall well-being product politicians take some time but there's a lot of catalysts that are almost mandated today so coming on a co vid you've got taxes you've got jobs you've got health care and you've got social justice cannabis touches on all of those the huge driver of jobs of taxes in North America it will be an Australian short order and on the social justice side cannabis tends to be very disproportionately effective of people of color and you're finding that's also pushing some regulations to be lifted around decriminalization things of that nature so as we need jobs as we need taxes as we need industry cannabis is really the my opinion best option for any government going forward and Australia's doing a very good job today I like your pH I like the way that you're not only talking about the product but the whole ecosystem that it comes with CBD or CBD oil is something that you know I heard fleetingly maybe three years ago and it seems like one of those products that now has become part of mainstream conversation are you seeing that in other parts of the world yeah CBD is an interesting one it became extremely hot in the last 18 months and and there were certainly some products that hit the market that I think had questionable value to them CBD infused pillows is a popular one on social media but in terms of you know myself as a case I use CBD oil every day I treat it much like vitamin C or vitamin D it is simply part of my daily routine it helps with anxiety it helps with sleep it helps with pain beyond that it's also something I have an older dog in the house and the effects on my dog in terms of quality of life are substantial CBD is something that is going to continue to grow it's been Declassified by the IOC so in the upcoming Olympics I think you'll see a lot of tie ins LeBron James Usain Bolt or some athletes have spoken prominently about CBD and it really to me feels like the next wave of you know call it what multivitamins vitamin C were ten twenty years ago CBD is likely to represent that beyond just taking it as a standalone product I think you'll see it infused in everything from beverages to foods to muscle rubs you know you name it it will be a very prominent product over the next 10 20 years fantastic I've you you've been in the industry for a while you had a business previously with a name that I just love star buds tell us how you got involved sure so initially I had been in the food industry franchising restaurants really cannabis caught my eye in 2013 when Colorado became the first US state to allow legal cannabis the lines were in some cases five six blocks long to get into these businesses so it made a lot of sense from the dollars and cents side of it but also on the social justice side something I very much believe in in terms of both being a cannabis user and a business person and really that developed our medical arm in Canada which launched we have a Prime Minister came in Justin Trudeau in early 2015 ish and he developed a legalization program so Canada's been on the forefront we did enter into a joint venture to bring the Starbucks brand into Canada from Colorado we recently sold that business to a public company in Canada and really all focus at this point is Australia and New Zealand where we see that the next wave of cannabis markets opening up and something we think will be the biggest growth industry in the country over the next three to five years died the timing of having you on couldn't be any more perfect you've got a virtual crowd equity campaign running the expressions of interest I think close in a few hours what's been the what's been their demand around inquiries it's been excellent it's far exceeded expectations you know you never quite know the opinions of people till you go to market but I think we're on pace for you know numbers that far exceed where we thought they would be and it's an interesting mix of people that we've talked to from those that believe in cannabis from the product side to those that believe in it from the business side to those that are seeing positive change from government regulation so attracting a wide variety of investors from those with a few hundred dollars to those with sizeable amounts to invest and you know we like the opportunity it's the hottest market in an industry with a lot of growth potential our team is very experienced beyond myself in public markets and we think Australia really beyond the CVD reclassification the record patient counts there's also with the potential for New Zealand to vote throughout all use in the coming months there's a ton of positive catalysts coming up and you know from our opinion it's it presents an opportunity to really build some equity in our company and ultimately return capital to shareholders that's our goal we want to build a great business and help make people a lot of money you come to Australia what is the business model is it a is it a franchise model is it licensing how do you have you set up here we've run the clinics corporately up to this point we'll continue to expand on the corporate level we've also added in telemedicine so given the kovat world that we live in you have both the challenge of patients unable or unwilling to leave houses and and the reality is we don't know what the next wave of kovat looks like so telemedicine is a way to reach patients in markets where we don't have physical clinics we're also working on the product side so we have some excellent manufacturing partners both within Australia and outside of Australia that are helping to provide that market with products that we think have very good medical efficacy to them but also provide some ability to boost our revenue as a company and ultimately we see an expansion of both the physical clinics coming in Melbourne as the next targeted stop but I love the Gold Coast as well Perth as a great cannabis market developing today and you know eyes on new zealand with the potential of that adult use folk coming through our teams experienced in that type of market that involves out of use as well so but for today corporately run businesses a lot of opportunities to partner on the licensing side we haven't taken them yet but it doesn't mean we won't down the line I look at an example of the way a business like Specsavers came to Australia they effectively appointed franchises who were optometrists that gave them a level of a level of credibility I think that's probably a model that you know maybe maybe a fee for you guys we you know we're partnering with medical professionals or doctors down the trail absolutely that was an early path to market for us in Canada right now we have a great team of physicians were aligned with we get a lot of inquiries from other physicians that have an interest in cannabis it's really starting to see that part of the wave now that there's 4,000 plus prescriptions a month happening in Australia it was a record again in May and they're seeing these prescriptions come out they have interest in learning about cannabis from the product side how can it positively affect patients and they want to add it to their practice because they can see demand from their patients that exists today so it's a model we've used we anticipate doing that going forward and it doesn't mean that all the physicians will work with will be exclusively cannabis practitioners but they may have a day or a half a day a week where they see cannabis focus patients because the effects of say relieving chronic pain may ultimately help with other underlying issues that patient has and really it's a positive medical benefit that's what doctors want to do and cannabis has been very beneficial in in providing that certainly around the globe at this point I have a final question as a founder and an operator how do you how do you spend your day are you are you lobbying for government change are you screening potentially new staff for professionals to work with giving you give me a bit of a breakdown on whatever a typical day looks like the days are long so I work both in Canada and Australia generally start around 6:00 and end around midnight so there's a lot to to fill the day and it's a mix of anything that one would expect there's a financial component there's a business components of the day-to-day operations there's dealing with things like HR staffing fun stuff like accounting record-keeping all of those are mixed in a lot of time on the phone I really like talking to people getting a feel of what's going on in their worlds I think that's still our best form of communication but really you have to be flexible you need to have a vision of where you want to go but ultimately reassessing how you're how you're doing along the path and you know it's each day is different there is a government component again we've met the Australian Government Canada many times dealing with them on policies but it's it really is every day is a different day and you know really it's try and keep your head down work hard make positive effects Dave fantastic you love having you on can you give out the URL for people that want to find out more about you sure so if you go to Crump as clinically you that's where our services are and if you go to Birchall comm dot a you you can find out our expression of interest that does close later on today we'll be going into our private capital raise next week and then the public into July so you know if you're interested check it out demand has been excellent and and we were we look forward to expanding into the Australian market dive your man on the mission thank you and good luck with it all really appreciate your time"
aJexnve70Vs,Navigating Medicinal Cannabis in Australia | QENDO Women&#39;s Health Week Event,2020-09-11T08:45:00Z,hi everyone and welcome and thank you so much for tuning in to this webinar with quendo we are really excited to bring you this discussion around cannabis in australia which we know is a really hot topic given how many people with endometriosis adenomyosis pelvic conditions access it we also know there's loads of information out there and there's also loads of misinformation out there so we're really excited to bring you today a panel of experts from advocacy who work in the area who prescribe and also educate in this space please welcome tegan skates who is the founder of high on hemp deandra phillips who is the chief operating officer of tetra health and a long-term person who's been working in the space with medicinal cannabis dr wendy who is a gp from victoria and prescribes medicinal cannabis and georgia stewart who many of you might know she has been an endometriosis advocate for many years so thank you everyone for coming and for your time today i would really love for you to introduce yourself so people can get to know who you are and why you became in this space deandra if you'd like to kick off we'd love to hear about you sure thanks so much and great to be here um like just said my name is deandra phipps i'm the ceo at tetrahealth i've been in the cannabis industry for about four or five years now first in canada which was a much different you know country as far as its regulations we had over 400 000 patients when i left two years ago to come to australia and wow when i got here i felt like i kind of went back in time a few years so um it's been really great to found a company like tetra and see the industry grow and i can't wait to discuss more about it today thank you deandra it's a very different space isn't it and it's excited to exciting to bring some education here today so thank you wendy how did you get involved in in medicinal cannabis in your practice yes well after being a general practitioner for many years somebody approached me about prescribing medicinal cannabis and like d'andra said it's a very clunky process of applying for permits and i did have an interest so i did embark on the journey and now i've got hundreds of patients that i do prescribe for with i must say some of them have amazing results and that has fueled my interest in continuing to prescribe you touched on a really interesting point there some of them were able to see some benefits and we'll get into that a little bit later so just park that thought everybody we'll move on to uh introducing you to tegan who's the founder of high on hemp and welcome tegan thanks jess thanks for having me so tell us about hi on hemp and who are they what's in the name um give us some info yeah sure so i started uh high on hemp in 2014 so it just started as a little old instagram account which has really started to grow over the last couple of years so essentially the platform was created to educate and raise awareness of cannabis here in australia and showcases how its purpose can change the way that we live so when we first started we really concentrated on the hemp industry but over the last couple of years we've now expanded into you know the medicinal cannabis world and had a particular focus on black market products as well which i'm really excited to talk about fantastic thank you tegan and georgia lots of people know you georgia and i'm really excited to have you on here tell us a little bit about you so my name is georgia um i'm an endometriosis advocate um i've been advocating for endo of almost two years now mainly on instagram um i got prescribed medicinal cannabis almost a year ago so i have been sharing my experience online with using medicinal cannabis and yeah i'm just really excited to talk today about how much it has made my life easier absolutely fantastic and we really see medicinal cannabis as a tool for a toolbox so well at quindo and in the community we talk about everyone has a different toolbox and things will work for some it might not work for another and medicinal cannabis is another option for people when you may not be interested in having another surgery or perhaps going on high you know high level opioids it's another option to try it's another physio option it's another osteo it's just another option but it also is quite difficult to understand isn't it and so today when we what we're going to talk about is some of the costs involved um the process the eligibility what are some of the experiences uh and and really finding out some of the information that a lot of the people in our community have asked and when we put this poll up on instagram and on socials to say you know do you guys want to know about it we had so many people come in and say yes please help me because i want to know if it's an option and and really how to do that so we'll dive straight into it and i'd love to open the floor out to d'andrea who's going to talk around patient access the costs involved deandra can you tell us talk us through this labyrinth certainly definitely and it certainly is labyrinth but the good news is it's gotten a lot easier um so to introduce tetra a bit more uh we're a medicinal cannabis clinic network and we assist patients by connecting them with doctors throughout australia so we help streamline this very you know convoluted kind of prescription process and we provide ongoing support through our amazing team of specialist nurses to ensure that our patients get the best possible treatment outcomes so you know it's really great to be able to chat here you know about medical cannabis and its role in helping with symptoms of endometriosis and we certainly see a lot of patients come to us with conditions um you know similar to this and they do get approved so i'll let some dr taishan kind of speak about the results but i'll get into the process um i i think that the patient community and the healthcare community have a few assumptions around legal medical cannabis you know one that it's hard to get approval for two that it's going to get you high and three that it's very expensive so i guess i'll just break down some of those stigmas and chat about um you know the overall process so um like we were saying before cannabis has been legal for almost three years and that might seem like a long time but in comparison to other countries like canada and the u.s where we've had legal systems in place for almost 20 years um and like i said before 400 000 registered patients um it's definitely still in its infancy stage here in australia so it's estimated that we have about 17 000 patients or so and we hope to see you know we're seeing about 5 000 new approvals come in every month so it's definitely gaining traction um now because we're still in our infancy stage there's a huge educational gap in the healthcare industry so our doctors are not taught about medical cannabis in medical school and it can be sometimes quite confronting i think both for doctors and patients because of some of the stigmas that surround the plant and the potential effects that it might have so we get calls all the time from patients wanting support in how to approach their physician for a referral or even just to talk about medical cannabis as a potential treatment option and you know it's understandable because a lot of people feel like they're disclosing this dirty recreational habit and i think there's a lot of people that have anxiety and a lot of stress around approaching it in in a medical way because they feel like they have to justify their use of cannabis and i think they're scared of what their doctor might think about what their um you know their family might think what their you know colleagues at work might think but you know that said we always encourage um our patients to disclose their use or at least talk about it with their physicians um because it's so important for your entire physician network or your circle of care to be informed about any new treatment that you start and you know that safety and the continuity of care is so critically important to ensure that you you're safe and you get the best possible treatment um from all of the physicians involved so you know all of that considered of being on the front line for the last two years at tetrahealth and working collaboratively with a lot of gps and specialists you know we we see that physicians are becoming more and more open to discussing the potential of medical cannabis as a treatment option so you know even if physicians aren't willing to prescribe we're definitely seeing seeing them you know not wanting to be gatekeepers for treatment and at least referring or providing um assistance in finding another medical cannabis specialist you know at a clinic or or some other route that would be actually um really open to assisting them and you know a lot of physicians are prescribing you know cannabis over other classes of drugs like opioids benzodiazepines and ssris that sometimes have more significant side effects than cannabis and when cannabis is monitored and titrated properly we are actually seeing a lot of really positive effects without some of those side effects that they might experience from other medications so you know if you're finding that you can't get a referral from your physician and you require one um you can simply call the clinic reception at one of your gps or specialist clinics and just ask them for a health summary and ask it to be faxed over to the clinic that you're working with or the doctor that's requesting it and it's a click of a button for the the reception team and it just basically states your diagnosis um which you of course need to have a chronic condition which means they have something that's lasted for more than three months um and you've tried some other form of other uh therapy so whether you know like i said before whether it's an opioid or a benzodiazepine right depending on your your condition so um that gets sent over it confirms everything that you know your team needs to know about your diagnosis and the current medications that you're you're taking so we can screen for drug interactions and it's as simple as that to kind of get the process started um so as far as the pathways to to access other than a clinical trial um cannabis can be obtained in australia through two different government regulated pathways one is called the special access scheme and the other is called the authorized prescriber scheme so the special access schema we call the sas for short allows your doctor to apply for an application through the therapeutic goods administration which we call the tga and you and your doctor receive an approval for a specific product now that approval lasts for one year and that also requires a prescription to be sent to the pharmacy to be eligible to to dispense for you so if you do require a new product or you know a change in product your doctor will have to apply for a new saspy approval and write a new prescription for you now um that's done through a portal and it's a lot easier now than it was say a year year and a half ago when everything was done by paper and submitted electronically or through the post and the tg have a 24 to 48 turn around approval time um which really speeds things up so there's a lot of um stigma around this and oh it takes so long to get approval and it's going to take me months to seek approval but because the tga have this mandate approvals actually go through quite quickly um i would say about 80 percent of approvals for cannabis products are sought through the you know obtained through the saspe program um but what's becoming more increasingly popular is called the authorized prescriber scheme or the ap scheme so it's actually a status that your doctor can apply for through a human research ethics committee which we call an a-truck committee and it allows them to prescribe um without actually having to obtain that sas b approval so they can prescribe cannabis for a certain class of indication so like chronic pain or you know anxiety or ptsd and they can then also apply for certain products so every time that they want to add new products or new indications they'll have to go through this process and it does take a couple of months but being able to bypass that fast b program and approval process allows them to script freely so it actually does speed up the process a little bit now it is a misconception that a doctor must be an authorized prescriber in order to actually seek approval for their patients but this is false so any medical practitioner meaning a specialist or a gp can apply for that sasvy application with the exclusion of gps in tasmania now um this is the only state that has some some tough just you know dispensing and also prescribing regulations um but in addition to that and i think where the problem is is that 80 percent of gps would rather refer more because it's just that they don't have the the same knowledge or education about what products to prescribe how to monitor and titrate dosing and they they want to kind of leave it to medical cannabis specialists which um there are plenty now across australia so um under the saspy scheme depending on the doctor state or territory as well as the type of medication they're applying for so um in just as a side note in australia there's two classes of scheduled medicines that apply to medical cannabis one is called um schedule 8 which is thc medications so anything with high amounts of thc are just pushed up into schedule 8 and do need a state health department approval in some states so s4 medications are medications that are predominantly cbd and are 98 or more cbd so if it falls into that other two percent where there's two percent or more of other cannabinoids it actually gets pushed up into a schedulate so there's not a lot of cbd um s4 medications in australia so through this process each state is very different for example queensland health is not involved at all in any part of the approval process um victoria has actually removed requirements to actually seek the state health approval until september 30th due to covid um and then south australia western australia sorry sorry um do require approvals um but you know if you you want more information about that you can definitely jump on our website and um check out a state-by-state guide that we have about all the different requirements for state health departments sorry no way so and that's really interesting to find out because we have so many people across australia we'll we'll also be sharing some links um that people can find with references to tetra so um people have that info so if we can just pedal back a little bit someone that has endometriosis is that a an is that a medication a condition that's listed that can access medicinal cannabis if they that person chooses to or are they coming under the banner of chronic pain what what's the goal yeah so um under the approval process it would be a chronic pain application and 80 percent of what we deal with is chronic pain so um it would be detailed in their clinical justification a little bit more about their condition what the symptoms there that they're experiencing so it does get detailed but um as the tj sees it it comes in as chronic pain georgia in your experience you are someone that has endometriosis chronic pain will has you know in the past it does wear its head sometimes and you've also accessed medicinal cannabis what was that process like for you um to be honest it was a lot easier than i thought it was going to be um like i i prepared so much stuff to take to my appointment um but the referral i got the referral pretty much straight away from my gp um he witnessed me like you know going to the hospital and prescribing all the opioids and everything and he could see that i was having really bad side effects so he wasn't wasn't too hesitant on giving me the referral because you can see i was quite desperate um so yeah i got the referral and then i think i got into a doctor within like two weeks or something um but yeah i had so much paperwork because i thought it was going to be like so extremely hard and then when i got in there the doctor my doctor was like wow you're so prepared like you've got so much stuff with you and i was like well i've heard it's like really hard and she was just kind of like no like it's it's fine like and it was actually really straightforward um i think um she uses the the sass the sass program yeah yeah because um i i get my product sent to the pharmacy and every time i need a new product i need the like approval and stuff so it was really interesting to hear about that because i'm i'm like not too sure of how it works when people ask me so it's yeah it's good to know this stuff so the process is someone is considering medicinal cannabis to use as a part of their toolbox to manage their pain or condition then they go to their doctor and discuss or their gp and discuss you know what they want to do and that can be any gp or any specialist or prescribe or health professional it's a clinician outside of tasmania tasmania is the only exception and after they prescribe after they have that prescription is it it's dispensed by the pharmacy so you go there and get pick up your normal scripts exactly um so a lot of patients these days are seeing their doctors by telehealth so a lot of times the doctors will ask okay where do you want your script sent and the pharmacy piece is a little confusing still for some patients because not all pharmacies will dispense medical cannabis um the process is very manual for them it's an unregistered product for pharmacies so it's not in their dispensing software so they're literally filling out you know pdf forms and sending them to suppliers to receive stock um pharmacies cannot actually stock the product and keep it on hand um which is a bit frustrating for some patients because they you know they go through this big process they go and see their doctor and they take their script to the pharmacy sometimes and they go oh we don't know what to do with it or okay we can get this in but it's going to be another three or four days so um you know there's certainly things happening in the background that are automating some of those processes and allowing pharmacies to store on site um which is great and um you know tetra we work with um you know certain pharmacies that's um set really fair pricing on on the products because um unfortunately there is no uh regulation on the margin that can be set on medical cannabis products so you sometimes you go to the pharmacy and you think you're going to pay you know say two hundred dollars for your bottle of um of cannabis but then it's 250 or 300 and you go whoa what's happening why is it so expensive so um you know we work with trusted partners that allow us to provide really low cost options to to our patients and that's really top priority for us okay so let's get into that cost a bit because this is a big one that people come in and i you just mentioned it's not regulated but so if someone is prescribed medicinal cannabis um they're already probably forking out loads of money to manage their condition or you know i don't see georgia smiling acupre acupuncture physio osteo specialist it costs a lot of money and if you through do ivf throw that on top of it as well so for people that are wanting to consider medicinal cannabis what it it's what investment are they looking to um to outlay yeah so if you're lucky enough that your doctor will prescribe for you um and you can do it in clinic then usually they'll just build medicare which is great there may be a nominal fee to to put on top of that to help with some of the admin costs in the back end um but usually it is a nominal nominal fee um now the unfortunate part about some some clinics and um look there's lots of them out there all kind of servicing different areas different needs or specialties but it's really important to do a little bit of research on which clinic is best for you some of them unfortunately do have hidden costs they aren't really upfront about that so you could actually walk away and spend 650 thinking it was only going to be maybe you know 100 or 200 and it really puts patients in a difficult position so um you know not all of them are bad there's definitely some great ones out there so just um you know head to there's a couple of great resources we'll share um for patients to be able to to look for the best clinic for them um now as far you know for tetra it's 300 for the year and so we provide an ongoing nurse support um that's two two appointments with your doctor two medications all of the scripts so if you are going to start asking some questions from clinics you know do you have any application fees do you have any rescripting fees um how many medications does this include for me because a lot of patients actually have to change medications or get something stronger um so you know ask those questions and get to know the clinic up front prior to making a commitment um and as far as the cost of medication the good news is it's coming down um you know a year ago we were relying strictly on imported products so the products are coming from canada um you know um from the from europe and there's huge import fees and then they're stored in like the you know the scheduled facilities and then they're distributed you know piece by piece to the pharmacies because they can't bulk ship to pharmacies because they can't store them on site until you know um georgia comes in with their script and and wants to get a bottle so um the good news is through the ap scheme now um you know pharmacies can receive bulk orders so the costs are coming down more domestic suppliers are coming into the market so there aren't all of these you know importing fees and logistics fees that get that get tagged on um on average i think our patients would be paying especially for chronic pain management it's one of the higher end and would be paying between that five to eight dollar a day range um so when you break it down day by day does it seem like a lot no but like you said if you have all of these other treatments that you're going through um sometimes it can be a bit cost prohibitive and it does unfortunately some of our patients get to that point they say well it's either my ex or my medical cannabis but like i said the good news is the costs continue to come down and over the next six months we'll see more and more domestic suppliers coming into the market fantastic wendy in your practice you must see loads of people who um you know can benefit and also they may it may not be an option for them can you talk us about what you have seen in your gp practice yes it's such a big topic it's hard to know where to start so i know why most doctors don't prescribe medicinal cannabis and that is because there's the barrier of it not having tga approval or having to go through the sass b so there's no controlled clinical trials telling conventional gps how effective it is and what the dangers are but i'll come back to that so in my practice of course i see a lot of people suffering from chronic pain and funnily enough most of them don't ask me about medicinal cannabis or assume that we don't prescribe and so i do have a little model of a medicinal canada spray on my desk which could be a conversation starter and some people look at that and ask me about it but others just go no i don't want to do that but it is just a conversation starter most of my patients have actually sought me out through accessing information on the internet and then finding out that i am a medicinal cannabis prescriber and i also um an authorized prescriber for some products but the difficulty is for me as a gps there's so many products on the market that i even i don't know who to approach to find out what all the products are and so it's like an ad h ad hoc arrangement of like a flyer coming in to tell me what they are or a rep coming past to tell me what the products are so some of my patients who are well researched come and educate me and they tell me that they've done all the research and they would like to try this or that which sort of leads me to how i do decide how to prescribe which is by asking them about what they've researched and their experience because we haven't gone into yet the combination between cbd and thc and this is the million dollar question when prescribing medicinal cannabis like deandra said you have to have gone through all conventional other medical treatments before you're eligible so if you come to me with your medical history and you have satisfied that criteria then yes i can get you a permit but then where would you start so some people are very reluctant to try any thc because of the implications on driving which we can talk about later or they've done their research and they're convinced that cbd as the anti-inflammatory component is going to be what helps their illness so some of them have also come in and they're already using street cannabis and yes they're coy to say that but actually for my prescribing that's a bonus because now i know that they are accessing it and they are benefiting and they're not having any any adverse effects so that helps me and then we can establish if they want to keep using cannabis as a herb which you can do which most people are surprised that they could access legal cannabis as a flower or take it as an oil so i don't know how much detail you want me to go into but the oils are cbd thc combinations and you could start with the pure cbd oil so you're not having to deal with any of the thc side effects and some people just wish to start on that and i would think if they were elderly they had no experience well we're talking about endometriosis so they're obviously not elderly but if they don't have any experience with cannabis that's a good starting point right there's also a school of thought where you start with a balanced oil which is cbd to thc about one to one and see if that helps the thc can potentiate the effects of the cbd it is also excellent for pain management but also other symptoms of endometriosis like the nausea maybe it will help with bowel or bladder symptoms it's really an individual response so you've got to start somewhere so depending on whether you've got a lot of experience and you want a high thc or you want to go to the other end of the scale you just don't know how an individual patient is going to respond and then in my experience a third of people like i alluded to before have an excellent response and that is what maintains my interest because it's like fan it's a miracle i don't like to use that word because it is just another tool in your box i don't want people to come in thinking it's lorenzo's oil but they do have just a really good response which you can't deny but another third of people don't have any response which is disappointing and then there's about a third in the middle that do get a good response but not what they're expecting and that's when you can talk to them about increasing the thc content or maybe even if you are on a balanced oil moving down to the cbd only so i can't really pick which one is going to work for which patient so it really is tailoring it to each patient's response um you might want to chip in and ask me a question because i just don't want to go on monologue that was a really great monologue wendy don't don't worry that was that was really yeah that was fascinating and it's really good to hear that there's i mean everyone's different everyone is an individual yes just like some people get really great effects from a pelvic floor physio while others don't and it's the same for medicinal cannabis some people it works really lovely others you know not so much you touched on driving which is a big one especially for people who have to work or they might be a nurse how does all of that happen what you know what's the go there yes this is the million dollar question okay so on the product information it does clearly say or on our permits that if you use a medicinal cannabis product you cannot drive but in reality of course we know that people do drive on cannabis and it's really a moral decision by the person using if they are impaired or not and of course medicinal cannabis is about prescribing without getting the impairment from thc so we're not aiming to get high we're aiming to treat the symptoms and so it would be unusual that we were prescribing to the point where a patient was impaired however if you were pulled over and did the roadside test the tongue test would it show up positive if you were using oil regularly or you just had using the vaporizer and used it at night wouldn't the next day show positive we really don't know i believe it's up to the officer if it did show up positive and you did have some validation that we you were using it for medicinal purposes that they would show this discretion but we can't guarantee that um it's really up to each person to decide if if someone was with um was using medicinal cannabis as a tool would they carry a permanent on them would they have that with them to show they could ask their prescriber to give them a letter yes validating that they were using it as a medicinal cannabis trial and then it probably would be unlikely that the officer would pursue that because honestly just hear hear say how would that stand up in court but officers aren't equipped to do that impairment test by the side of the road apparently only specific police officers sorry can do that and the average officer doesn't do it so it's really a sticky area yeah it's really interesting that you touched on some people are using medicinal cannabis from the black market we could call it and that's and that um so we know people are accessing it we you know we're not um we're not blind to that and and why do you why do you think people are accessing it on the black market um look frankly they're going to be desperate and they've tried every other means of controlling their symptoms i don't know how common it is out there but a lot of people in their lifestyle it's common you know we've all heard that it can help with endometriosis and pain so if they do have access and they're in those circles they will be open to trying it and then when they do see the benefits of course they're going to keep using but i believe someone else is going to tell us about all the problems with accessing illegal cannabis and that's why i'm very happy to prescribe because at least with harm minimization people can have access to something which is got no additives in it is organically grown is going to be delivered to them in a way where they know exactly what they're using and the thing with medicinal cannabis is that you're liaising with somebody about what your dose will be and yeah that is an enormous benefit absolutely i'm really pleased to hear that you touched on that you it's in a controlled environment um with a kit a care team around you so they know how that's interacting with other things that are going on for you yeah exactly because a lot of people are on lots of different medications they do need to be advised about that um yeah i'm very happy to prescribe and keep people safe absolutely georgia can i touch can you have you ever worried about driving with your prescription is that something that's working um i do get worried about it but um i my prescription i have separate um so i've got a cbd bottle and then i've got a thc bottle and i mostly use the th i mean the cbd that's the one i use daily and then the thc i only use that if my pain is at a higher level so if i'm in a bad flare that's when i'll use that so i don't really use it that much and if i am going to use it i use it where i don't have to drive for the next three to four days um and where i live it's quite central so i you know i'm quite lucky i can just get on my bike and bike places and whatnot but it is it is worrying you know it is but unfortunately from what i know i don't know how accurate this is that the roadside testing isn't like accurate at all like someone had a thc a week week and a half ago and it can come up so it's unfortunately it's something that um i have to risk because yeah if i don't take it then i can't live like i can't yeah i can't keep going so yeah i i mean i'm mindful of it and i do try my best like i definitely wouldn't take it and then go and drive down to the shops that's something i wouldn't do but no yeah and and i guess um when we if we flip back to the black market which we're going to get into in just a moment um you know there are some people that are engaging in that for their chronic for managing their chronic pain and if we can bring that into a controlled sense of prescribed medicinal cannabis um it you know everyone will be safer yeah we bring that in as a tool so let's get into that so we have tegan here high on hemp found um to talk about the black market is it an issue in australia what's the go look most definitely um you know in saying that australians have been using cannabis for a very very long time and it is you know the number one most you know used illicit drug here in australia um and you know just seeing some of the data come out over the last couple of months is still showing that people are still you know buying cannabis from friends from local producers but what we're seeing now especially in terms of the cbd market is that there's been such a boom over the last you know 12 to 15 months really and we're seeing a lot of you know uninformed sellers actually selling cbd products and there's a lot of risks that comes with that so you know touching on what um deandra mentioned earlier is you know about how lots of people are importing product we're seeing the exact same thing here in the black market so what that means is people individuals are buying cbd from overseas and relying heavily on suppliers information that they're giving them and then using that to sell out to strangers so they've never walked through their crops they've never seen their infrastructure they don't know how this is is being processed and really they don't know how it's being labeled either so they're taking on a risk and then they're selling that product onto consumers which is really scary and and essentially the domino effect of that is you know the marketing claims that come with that right that you know a lot of people are buying into the hype of cbd at the moment that you know you're going to take cbd and it's going to you know change your life or it's going to make your life more manageable and for some people um it does and um it does work however at the same time you know cannabis isn't for everybody right um and not all cannabis is is created equally as well so when you're going and buying through the legal market you're getting a regulated product you know a regulated product in return which is is what you need um and especially when you are mixing it with other medications as dr wendy mentioned as well it's really important for you to have a relationship with your doctor um and be able to you know speak to them and and be with them through that process as well um so earlier this year um we were lucky enough to partner with a company um called cbd reviews australia so they're a facebook page which is you know dedicated to helping consumers you understand quality of products here in australia and we did an independent test with them on 62 black market products which are currently being sold and you know the results that came out of that were incredible so you had a one in four chance of buying a product um that isn't essentially what you think it is so it was rather labeled incorrectly or the cannabinoid content wasn't you know what they said it was and in saying that you had a one in nine chance of being sold a fake product that had zero cannabinoid content with it so and i i know i know that might say i'm oh it's only one in nine chance but when you're seeing the mass amounts of companies that are coming into the market you know last month as an example i noted 50 new companies on instagram alone that are now selling cbd oil and saying that it's legal saying that you know um you know making claims about it you know healing you and you know healing you maybe if it's for cancer or anxiety or depression or chronic pain and that's just for me you know it's quite predatory because there are people who are trying to you know invest into their health and not knowing what they're getting back in return is is a really scary thought you've mentioned it you know at all it's only one of nine but for that one person it's massive for them it's not you know we know how many people one in ten have endo and for that one person it's it's massive so and if someone has gone down the path of thinking about trying medicinal cannabis and and perhaps you know got one of those products that isn't isn't what it says it is that's a really dangerous for them it really takes the whole view yeah 100 and you know i one thing as well is you know pricing is obviously a big topic right and there's this there's a negative narrative at play at the market at the moment that you know when you go legal that it is more expensive and undoubtedly you know the process is a little bit more expensive but you know the key aspect to buying cbd as an example is you know the concentration and the amount of active ingredients within the bottle but you know one of the main factors is actually understanding the the milligrams um you know the active content in the concentrate so if you're looking at black market sellers sometimes what we're actually finding is the milligram pricing is actually higher in the black market than the legal market so um in one of the um the article that we put together that we launched the um the information about the testing that we did with cbd reviews australia one of the examples was a 2 000 milligram bottle and you know when you break that down i think it was don't quote me on this but i think it's 66.6 milligrams of milligrams of active content within the bottle but when you looked at the legal route they had a bottle which was 240 milligrams but what you were actually getting is 240 milligrams of active cannabinoids in there so you're getting actually four times the amount that you are in comparison to the black market so when you start actually breaking that down and and seeing the cost per milligram it's actually in some cases cheaper in the in the legal route which i think a lot of people don't really have an understanding of as well yeah that's fascinating and it's also um you know i i'm coming back to the legal just people know what's in there you know we know how that will interact with well the doctors will know how that will interact with other medications that you might be on but but that's a really um you know a really big market so if someone's looking for medicinal cannabis how would how would you tell between something that's on the black market as opposed to um a um you know what would you call it a authorized product yeah well um cannabis can only be prescribed by a doctor so anything that you're seeing online which is being sold directly to consumers is illegal and that doesn't matter if it's derived from hemp because that's also another issue in in the market as well is that because industrial hemp is legal when they call it hemp oil as an example that they sell it as being legal when it's it's definitely not anything that has you know cbd or you know thc of a high content within it it has to be prescribed through a doctor so it's you know it's it's very it's logical when you you look at it but you know it's because there are black market sellers out there who are essentially selling lies and they're actually cashing in on telling people how difficult it is to obtain legal cannabis yeah yeah they're they're telling them yeah they're telling people you'll you'll never get it you know they're buying into you know the media of you know it took me three months to be prescribed you know medical cannabis and uh you know it's that that is the issue when at the end of the day supporting the legal route you're actually when you support the legal system you're putting money back into the industry which is infrastructure which is desperately needed in the industry but you're also putting money back into the hands of people who are investing into clinical trials and much deemer data at the end of the day when you're buying a black market product you're essentially supporting someone's lifestyle it's as simple as that you're funding for them to live because they're not putting that money into what we actually need and you know talking about what deandre mentioned as well is that when sorry when you when you do invest your money back into the you know back into the the legal right you're actually creating a i guess almost like a domino effect especially with gps as well because you're being able to actually educate the educators which is what needs to happen at the moment which is gps who are you know still sometimes on the sideline with what you know on the sideline about actually prescribing it so when you show a doctor as an example how cannabis has actually helped you it helps them to actually you know push out onto somebody else that it may be you know worthwhile their time or maybe an option worth exploring for them so yeah it's it's really important for people to actually understand you know the importance of going legal and over time what will naturally happen is more people who are supporting the legal system the cost of product will essentially go down as the demand goes up and that's just business if i can jump in tegan's so right and it's so frustrating and you can hear the passion in her voice and frustration as well and we all share it because we're you know we're so regulated as legal companies we can't advertise product to consumers um we get cease and desist letters from the tga and yet there are all of these illicit companies just flagrantly you know promoting their products um with fictitious claims and it it's very hard because we put a lot of time energy love into building this industry and um and doing it the right way and to to further tegan's point on you know investing back into the legal channels you know these products are unregistered products and for companies and suppliers to actually get them to be registered products take millions and millions and millions of dollars in investment um but that in the end you know in three years in four years will actually have um you know pbs funded medications that will only be 12.50 when you go to the pharmacy and i know it seems very unfair for those that are having to kind of foot that bill right now but um you know like higgins said it's sometimes more expensive to go through the black market and you know having been in canada which we you know we have a legal growing opportunity for for registered patients so i grew cannabis for a long time and i've seen and i'm sure teagan has too she walks walks through you know legal crops all the time and you know without that experience without knowing how your medicine is grown um a lot of that bad things can happen you know powdery mildews um carcinogenics plant growth hormone like there's just so much junk and people say well it's just it's just cannabis you know you know just let you know and it's a very socially driven kind of movement because it has been an underground movement for so long that there's kind of a resistance against the corporate's way and the legal way um but there is good there you know uh and it's not saying that it's all good there's definitely some cowboys in the space in the legal face um but uh you know that will sort itself out in time but uh yeah it's so critically important we're at such a pivotal place right now in australia um where we're about to see huge growth and so it's it's coming and good things are happening you touched something really interesting there around um patients there is there is a stigma around medicine um about around illicit cannabis you know using it and bringing it to um to to a legal sense can be really probably quite daunting for someone that has relied on it for so long or they they want to talk about it with their gp but there is a stigma around it because maybe they have been accessing it um illicitly and they want to come over and you know join the legal path how can you can anyone give any suggestions is how to initiate that discussion with your doctor that could be a really really big thing to overcome does anyone have any suggestions around how to even how to even broach that topic with them um doctor's point of view yeah i would say that that is an awkward conversation because most doctors are not aware of the difference between illegal cannabis use and the benefits of medicinal cannabis so it's like an admission of using a legal product so you would have to sound at your doctor first to see if they were up to speed with what medicinal cannabis was because that would just be a put off and a lot of doctors are afraid that they're going to attract users and abusers of cannabis so when they start opening up their doors to i'm a medicinal cannabis prescriber they just imagine a queue of people who are trying to access weed at their door uh just like if you start prescribing inappropriately benzodiazepines or opiates you're going to attract a drug seeking community so i think that's one of the biggest barriers for gps being open-minded to prescribing and it's only when you've been working amongst other doctors who are prescribers that you and starting off myself that you realize that that doesn't happen so that is a really awkward conversation to start up if you've been accessing cannabis already yeah that's why when you go online like to tetra um you know they're experienced with people who have already accessed themselves uh it's an easier conversation if you're just wishing to seek access to cbd oil because they'd be more open-minded about that and it's even marketed to us doctors as medicinal cannabis without the hallucigenic effects like that's wrong in itself okay but that's how it's promoted to get doctors interested in prescribing so there's a whole sorts of myths that you have to work through i was also going to mention something else about the illegal cannabis in that um well i did hear that the street cannabis has grown from the indica strain because that's the easiest plant to grow and so in the medicinal cannabis field you've got access to a whole different variety of strains of cannabis which are bred for their medicinal properties so in opposition to just the street indica you can use a sativa plant or oil and then there's all sorts of other medicinal properties in cannabis like the terpenes and the strains that are used for medicinal cannabis have been grown to increase the terpenes for different varieties so it's a bit more complicated than just street cannabis okay so for those who probably have just had their mind blown right now it is not just one type of blanket cannabis marijuana you know it's not that it there's different strains and i understand those different strains would act on really particular groups of things yes exactly you've got access to people who are familiar with all the different medicinal properties of the different strains so then you're talking uh different oils what different companies can offer you some of them have like really refined what's in their oil it may not be the cbd or the thc which is giving you the medicinal effect it might be some of the other components in the plant called terpenes which are benefiting you just to throw that can of worms open yeah well it's another reason to work with someone who can prescribe that to you so they have a full understanding of your body and what's going on for you but they're educated um angle to to work this out and is this why it can take a little while to to adjust or work out your dose and your prescription is that why that's the case yes so you might have someone who's getting an amazing effect on one particular cbd oil or combo oil and then they swap to something else because the other one's not available and they don't get any effect and then only through knowing the composition of the oil that they were on the first time can you get them back to that place so yeah it still is trial and error but it requires more of a scientific approach than just yeah using cannabis we do we do find it takes about four weeks a lot of our patients get discouraged um because they go oh they you know they've been waiting so long they have this build-up and expectation and they take their first you know 0.1 of a mill because we have this approach of start low go slow um you know increase slowly so your body can adjust to it and they go oh i didn't do anything and they get so discouraged but you know through you have to kind of trust in the process and trust through that titration period which usually takes a month to really get that that optimal dose that works best for you um and you know sometimes patients that are using thc products and do have to um you know the bodies need to get accustomed to to that drug just like any new medication um so so we do work with patients there very closely and and wendy works with them to titrate them to a place um you know and then if they're dropping off of other drugs a re-titration might have to happen so if they're decreasing others we might have to increase cannabis just a little to kind of even even that out so there definitely is um a very close you know collaborative process between the patient and their their doctor for that first month to two months and then usually once you get there and you get to your optimal dose it kind of um you get a lot more comfortable with with your day-to-day dosing when you went to your gp and you said that you had you know reams of paper of paper of information ready and prepared what type of information did you feel as someone who was um seeking you know medicinal cannabis through the legal path what type of information did you feel you needed to present um i literally took everything what does everything mean so i yeah i had blood tests i had surgery photos i had communication between my gp my specialist um i had hospital discharge reports ultrasounds literally everything because i was just i was like as we spoke about before i was in my head it was so hard to be approved so i was i'm paying for this appointment i've got to like make sure i get it so i literally took everything with me everything we've become really used to advocating for what we want as people with indoor i don't know don't we you know you you're ready you've got over the years it's been a work in progress but i think i'm there now but it sounds like it's it's um despite what we might mentally build it up to be it it seems like a really approachable process if we work with clinicians and gps who um you know who understand the process and it sounds like it's becoming really um you know the more we can we can um support the legal path i think the easier it will come and certainly this discussion has facilitated you know how to to get there georgia as someone with endo what do you think about it you know how has it helped you um how does it work as a part of your toolbox and do you have any suggestions or messages for people out there with ender who might be considering using it yeah um well like you guys were just saying before um when i first got my prescriptions i mean i guess i should start with what i was prescribed so when i yeah my first prescriptions was a cbd bottle and then the thc bottle and the thc was to add in when the pain was like quite bad so i was take the cbd every day um which is amazing and yeah i added in the thc and then but when i first started i like was really i reacted really bad to the thc like i was in bed and couldn't basically get up i was just like so out of it um and this is where i think the legal route is so good because like i went back to my doctor and i communicated that with her and i said you know i was feeling really anxious like thc made me feel like really like out of it out of like control kind of thing and then she's like all right we need to increase your cbd dosage like spoke to me all about like how much i was taking and and now i'm at a point where it's when i have the thc i like don't really even notice it mentally if that makes like i know it's there like i know it's taking away the pain but i'm not i'm still able to function like whereas when i first started taking it i was like i don't think i'm gonna be able to like do my uni work with this like but now i'm at a point where when i do take it it's just kind of like i figured it out the right way to have it and i and i'm like when i first got it like within probably two weeks i wasn't sure if i was going to continue taking a thc oil but then yeah speaking with her she reassured me and adjusted dosages and to be honest i didn't realize there was so much to it i thought it was just kind of like this is what you do and that's it but since taking it it's so complex and we ended up adding in um a flower prescription as well because there was times when the thc oil was taking between an hour to to to like become effective and if i was in really bad pain then i'd find that was when i'd be reaching for like the pharmaceuticals as well so then that made the process of waiting for the oil like bearable so it's definitely like and i still consider that i'm still learning and still probably not at where i could be but yeah i think i think having a really good doctor is what you need especially with endo as well because it is so complex absolutely and communicate you know what i got out of that is you just kept communicating with your doctor who was working and you work together to get and to get to a place and um you know what works for you now when we know with endo you'll be you'll get to a place where you uh are managing it and then there'll be a crossroads yeah and you need to you know level up and add some other things to your toolbox or reconsider that's well right and there's another symptom coming in this month and another one the next month yeah it's i think with endo and cannabis it's definitely going to be like an ongoing managing figuring it out learning kind of thing it's like anything isn't it just like any other tool that we have in there well thank you so much everyone does anyone have any other comments or feel as though they they would like to share um any final thoughts just finally i'd like to add how safe medicinal cannabis is another good reason for me being open to prescribing so you just cannot overdose on it which is just fabulous to know unlike many other medications so that is a big bonus absolutely it absolutely is is there any other comments that anyone would like to ask just a clarification on an earlier point about the driving just to be clear um so you can actually legally drive on cbd medications so it's only the thc medication that can be detected in the roadside test so that's when wendy said you know it's really great to start off with cbd um because it doesn't cause the impairment and it's there's no risk of it actually showing up in a roadside test so for those that are a little nervous about starting it's a really good place to start um and the only other point on that is if you are working and are using thc medications we do advise patients to have a chat just like they would with their doctor and say hey you know what do you think about medical cannabis and start that conversation um we do suggest that they also have an open conversation at work um look into the workplace drug policy and see where there may be some leniency or openness to you using medical cannabis um if there are drug tests at your workplace and we've had a lot of companies um with people with chronic pain that are so open to their employees using it you know at night time to help them get better sleep and better quality of life and then using cbd during the day um it's been really wonderful to see so many you know different groups really coming on board and supporting people with chronic illness yeah and their productivity would probably increase if they're getting more um sleep definitely definitely the first thing that we see i'm sure wendy would echo is and i'm sure georgia felt is you know when you finally get that you know five six hours of sleep and you can eat and function in your day to day without having that constant thing you know kind of in the background your quality of life just goes goes up so definitely and i think as well with the nausea for endo and i know and stuff it's like the best thing for naughty or even just like stomach cramps like for everything but like for me the sleep and the nausea was like a big difference just absolutely from what deandra said as well is you know there is still you know a major stigma attached to cannabis and the more we can openly talk about it and just communicate our experiences um you know our opinions on it with you know our families you know at work and you know just create that domino effect and start you know getting out there and talking about it it will you know maybe perhaps get somebody over the line with you know looking at it as um as an option however in saying that you know just know that you know cannabis isn't an overnight destination it's a journey you know it's not a one-trick pony and anyone who tells you that it is is lying to you or just trying to get your money so just it's a journey um and yeah and do it safely and wisely most things that are an overnight don't really aren't sustainable i think we all know that with you know the decades of diets and all of these wonderful amazing things on instagram that cure everything um i think people with endo we can be really desperate because sometimes they're so we're in such a spiral because we don't know um you know we're in so much pain and we're tired and we're exhausted and so it's it's easy to fall into those part into those boxes of vulnerability but what we've talked about today is it is to access it um there is a process but it is easy you can start those conversations with the right people and we'll be sharing who they are and how to find them um in the in the coming weeks so i just like to thank you all for providing your expertise and thoughts and experiences with this so people can understand it is an option for the toolbox it is an option and um there we've just spoke about processes and access access paths to to add this so uh thank you all very much and um we will be hopefully bringing some more content on this in the months to come
q88cMa-Lw84,Inside the World of Australian Bong Making,2020-12-22T20:00:08Z,
M-QFi4ur7eI,Understanding The NZ Cannabis Referendum &amp; It&#39;s Impacts On Australia | This Month In Cannabis,2020-10-29T00:59:31Z,hey everyone tom brown here today we're here for episode four of this month in cannabis and this month in cannabis we're talking about the new zealand ref cannabis referendum today i'm here with my friend and co-host rhys cohen uh thanks for joining us today reese always a pleasure um so we're going to talk about um what passing the cannabis referendum or failure to pass the referendum could mean for australia so before we talk specifically reese about the new zealand cannabis referendum um let's talk a little bit about prohibition versus legalization so can you talk a little bit about prohibition with i guess the focus of is prohibition of cannabis really working that's a great question and i guess it's kind of hard to answer because we don't have anything to compare it against in australia it's just taken as the status quo basically but if you wanted to look at if one of the objectives of prohibition was to reduce cannabis related harms and to reduce problematic consumption of cannabis or consumption of cannabis in general uh it appears to be failing and it appears to have always been failing so it's never really been a success uh i think it would be better argue so um a 10 of australians 1 in 10 australians have used cannabis in the last 12 months over half of australians have used cannabis at least once in their lifetime um those figures have remained fairly constant for many years uh despite the criminalization of of of cannabis despite efforts to to intercept and interdict cannabis shipments and to eradicate cannabis supply chains it's a very popular commodity it's a very popular drug and loads of people continue to use it every day so i don't think i don't think you could argue that prohibition has been a success but we really won't know how successful or unsuccessful it was until we experiment with some other policy options we've seen legalization happen all over the world how has that change in legalization in other places affected their maybe not talking about economy but like again focused on prohibition how has it affected those countries or those states well i think that it's the the sort of moves towards uh legalization especially in the us at different state levels and then of course in in canada and uh and uruguay at the at the national level um those are those are all quite recent developments you know literally in the last year 10 or 20 years uh in total um even less than that um so i think it's a sign that the global sort of uh you know that a sign of the times so to speak and what you will see or what you do see especially if you look at for example in the states is that when one u.s state legalizes medical or recreational cannabis it increases the likelihood that neighboring states or states with similar political and social compositions will also pursue medical and recreational legalization so yeah these these these movements in other countries uh definitely provide uh templates in terms of regulation and legislation and how it might work they also provide examples of how the sky doesn't fall in uh when when these programs are implemented and it gives people a bit more confidence to experiment with different policy options back at home maybe for those who don't know much about the cannabis referendum that that is i guess or just occurred or is occurring can you give us an give us an overview of the proposed bill yeah so the proposal is to legalize the uh cultivation and manufacture of cannabis products for recreational purposes it would legalize the the creation and production of those products storefronts limited storefronts without any advertising would be allowed in certain regions jurisdictions so adults consumers could walk into a store and purchase up to 14 grams of cannabis from that store take it home and use it it would also legalize the personal cultivation of a small number of cannabis plants i believe it's uh two plants per person or four plants per household and it would also legalize but it would also allow people to own and operate cannabis lounges so these are venues which don't serve alcohol where people can go and consume their cannabis um legally and and this is i think that's a that's a really neat thing to happen early on in a recreational cannabis framework because you know often you know a lot of people are living in places where it's inappropriate or impossible for them to consume cannabis privately so they end up consuming it on the street and that's something that the bill does not allow so it doesn't allow for public consumption there's complete prohibition on the advertising of these products there are age restrictions there are daily purchase restrictions um there are limits on the potency of these products to ensure that they produce fewer harms um and lots of other um sort of yeah different interesting sort of features okay great and and so you know we've already said that cannabis is being legalized around the world and we have a lot of other models that that we can go from and you know new zealand has worked from can you tell us a little bit about how the new zealand referendum is unique it is the framework that that that i think best balances um solving the problem with protecting public health and doing it in a way that that is socially acceptable so what i mean by that is you know the problem is um cannabis is uh totally owned and controlled by criminal organizations that sell whatever they want to whomever they want of any age um without paying any taxes and without any uh you know medical or regulatory oversight so that's the problem that we're trying to solve here one of the ways in which you can solve that problem is by you know legalizing everything allowing everything to be sold to everyone and advertising is fine and this and that's the kind of model that you see in some places in the um and i'm not a huge fan of that model for for a few reasons one of the reasons is it's not politically palatable you know australians and new zealanders you know we i mean personally i feel a bit uh a bit a bit a bit down on the advertising of alcohol you know i don't think our alcohol should be advertised that's unnecessary um i don't think we should be advertising tobacco and i think we need to be advertising cannabis i think that the uh the new zealand framework is good because it balances those things you know so for example complete prohibition on advertising i've already said that but also things like strictly limiting the market share that any one cannabis company can have in the industry and thereby avoiding any any potential fears of large you know big cannabis corporations uh muscling in and um and influencing uh the government or the regulators to their advantage so one of the things you just touched on at the end of that little explanation there which was great was that there is a limit to how much market share someone can have and and i think that's a really interesting point because in our current medical cannabis framework here in australia a lot of doctors don't know how many products are out there patients don't know how many products are out there and the ones that are most prescribed are the ones that get to the doctors first and um you know are able to educate faster so tend to be the ones with a bigger marketing budget or more people working for them and so that that in itself even in a market where it is regulated can be a real challenge so i think that's a really interesting point to touch on off the back of that then you know you also mentioned that you like the public health aspects so can you talk a little bit more about that yeah so the way the way the way the bill is designed uh has public health at the forefront so first of all the objective of the bill is to reduce harms in the community and to improve public health that is the that is the single most important objective of the bill which is as it should be so that includes things like um you know imposing an excise tax on on cannabis products a percentage of which will be dedicated to harm reduction education programs drug rehabilitation programs you know community education that kind of thing um but also the the way in which the uh the production caps are managed is that the government will set a total quantity of cannabis that can be produced in a year and they will allow companies to apply uh to have the right to produce a share a percentage up to 20 and the criteria by which those companies will be allocated uh market share uh will be based on um you know first of all they're you know fit and proper and they can do the job but secondly the extent to which they are giving back to communities that are harmed by the war on drugs especially maori communities and the extent to which they are giving back to their local community you know employing local people and that kind of thing so the whole framework is set up so that the most successful companies will always be the companies that are producing the most social good as opposed to the companies that are generating the greatest profits which i think is really cool that is that that's really great and i think you know this leads really well into the next question or the next topic which is education so you know leading into the the vote we saw a lot of information and stats that showed that people who were more educated on the bill what the bill uh you know what the framework was and then what the outcomes of that bill would be were more like likely to vote yes can you talk about what some of the highlights of the campaign leading up to the vote were you know there were a few interesting moments um you know it was interesting to me when it when it came to light that many of the anti-uh reform or or you know sort of anti-legalization groups that had been campaigning against um the referendum uh were found to have very close links with prohibitionist organizations from overseas i think that really shone a light on how international prohibitionist organizations can astroturf campaigns in other countries so the anti-cannabis campaign uh were were well known for lying uh for mischaracterizing other people's arguments um and uh for playing pretty dirty i think it would be fair to say when it when it came to to the campaign so that was one interesting thing um the other the other uh classic sort of moments i think has to be the new zealand uh medical association um uh coming out uh strongly against uh voting yes on the referendum and being against legalizing recreational cannabis um only to have such a massive backlash from its membership that it had to revise its position a few days before the new zealand election and say that it now takes a neutral stance um i thought that was quite interesting because that shows that medical practitioners and people who care about public health in new zealand are actually paying attention to this and they expect their organizations that represent them to to actually represent what they believe um you know and how they feel about these issues i thought that was really great too yeah absolutely and i think you know we often see the ama speak out um not necessarily against but not for cannabis in australia even medicinal cannabis and you you hear quite often that a lot of medical practitioners will say you know the ama doesn't represent all of our opinions and and you know i think it's just a matter of time before we uh with the growth of medicinal cannabis in australia we begin to see some something a little bit more like that where medical practitioners are saying you know you can't keep being against this because you know we're not all against it and at the end of the day like it's not about being for or against the use of cannabis people are already using cannabis cannabis is already in the community it's not it's not it's not an argument or a question about whether that should or shouldn't be the case it's about do you want it to be run and controlled by organized crime gangs or do you want it to be run and controlled by the government with the primary interest of protecting public health that's the actual choice so let's talk about the referendum and how outcomes can relate to australia so maybe to start can you compare and contrast the consumer markets uh in australia and new zealand folks pretty similar i think so so recent use of cannabis in australia is about 10 to 12 percent and that's the same in new zealand so i was reading the other night that by the age of 21 over 80 percent of new zealanders had had used cannabis at least once which is quite extraordinary um and i don't think that's the same in australia so in australia if you want to buy cannabis generally speaking you need to know someone who knows someone who knows a dealer you know you have to connect with an individual you know you know in a very sort of direct way yeah in new zealand they have tinney houses which are um you know little little outlets basically that you without without needing to know anyone who knows someone who sells weed um you can literally just walk up to it to uh to one of these premises you know knock on the door hand over your money get your cannabis so elicit supply is a lot easier and a lot more accessible in new zealand than it is in australia probably without having done you know much research on the subject what can australians and the australian government learn from the referendum when when thinking about the future of cannabis in australia the new zealand model i really can't emphasize this enough like the new zealand model is is so beautiful in the way in which it manages to balance these competing objectives and to do it in such a way that is politically acceptable and socially acceptable you know i think i think if an australian politician came out and said you know i want to make i want to legalize cannabis and i don't care if there are billboards you know advertising um you know cannabis shops all around australia obviously that's not going to fly in this country um you know but but if you but if you came to the people with a proposal that was you know a complete prohibition on advertising you know plain packaging yada yada um i think it's i think it shows that there are so many there's such a wide spectrum of policy options for regulating these products and it is possible to do it in such a way that genuinely protects public health you know avoids some of the worst aspects of other cannabis markets and does so in a way that is you know popularly acceptable so that you know from the regulators and politicians perspective i think that's an important lesson from the other side of the from like you know the the activists and the campaigners like you mentioned you know one of the really interesting things that came out of new zealand was their market research which found the more that people anyone any people the more than anyone actually sat down and engaged with the meat and potatoes of the bill and understood what was actually being proposed the more likely they were to vote in favor of it because it's a very compelling proposition so what that tells me is okay you know if we're ever going to attempt something like this in australia we need to um have a well-developed and acceptable policy framework thought out in advance and we need to start educating people on the specifics of that framework as early as possible you know i think if the you know if the referendum campaign uh in new zealand had an extra three months or an extra six months um to to educate people about the about about the substance of the bill um i think the chances of a of a successful yes vote would have been much much higher what do you think is the next step in australia you know we've we have we've experienced and are experiencing covid um we've seen a lot more people move to medicinal cannabis there's a lot of talk about cannabis legalization or decriminalization as being a way to raise funds in australia with the economy being down what's next here a lot of people put a lot of stake in the economic arguments for legalization many people think that uh you know legalizing cannabis will create jobs and growth and you know capture tax revenue many people think that that is the that is one of the best arguments to make in favor of cannabis legalization i i don't think that's the case what people probably care the most about i would argue is um improving public health outcomes you know reducing harms uh reducing you know sending kids down the into the criminal justice system um you know improving equality that kind of down that route i think probably we'll see uh further decriminalization before we see any meaningful step towards legalization um you know reducing criminal penalties for you know personal use um even removing any criminal penalties for personal use that would be great um and then slowly make our way towards you know something more commercial down the track it will be interesting to see how australia's medical cannabis framework evolves over the next few years you know i think when we when we started off in 2016-17 it was very obvious that that that you know anyone who got access to medical cannabis uh was was automatically a legitimate patient because it was so difficult and so expensive and such a risk and took so much effort maybe it's possible that the medical cannabis framework and and possibly even desirable that our medical cannabis framework will get to a point at which it's um you know quick easy and affordable to access um medical cannabis at which point you know we might see a bit of a blurring between medical and non-medical users who seek a prescription for cannabis that has the risk of delegitimizing medical cannabis in its and its legitimate therapeutic uses and the medical cannabis framework but it also has the possibility of just you know normalizing or increasing the normalization of you know how what people how people think and feel about cannabis so you know we're going to find out the outcome of the referendum in the coming weeks what do you see how do you see the outcome impacting australia if the vote is yes then there will be an immediate requirement for political parties in australia to take another look at their recreational cannabis policies and how they how they talk about them greens have had legalized recreational cannabis as a as a as a policy for several years now um we are starting to see a few members of the labour party uh take a softer stance towards decriminalization which is interesting um and we'll probably end up seeing what we see in other countries which is a weird coalition of um uh right wing libertarians and uh left-wing social justice public health advocates uh band together around the issue you see that all through the states it's possible that in a few years time there will be a significant amount of cannabis tourism um that that new zealand attracts both from australia and around the world um that that's the that's the main sort of economic um carrot i i guess more so than um then production um and sale and then i guess you know even if the vote is no what was interesting was um so um ardern was interviewed about uh about cannabis after the election but before the referendum results have been announced which is yet to happen and she was asked a question along the lines of um you know hey if the if the referendum is a no like what are you going to do about cannabis policy and i think your answer was something along the lines of oh well look obviously we'll take a look at it just because a referendum is against this form of full legalization it doesn't mean that we're not going to address some of the issues that we know exist around cannabis use in new zealand so i think even if the voters are no you will see drug law reform to do with cannabis use in new zealand probably widespread decriminalization of some kind um and that will also you know send a signal back to australia that hey these policies are potentially popular and also effective with regards to public health what are the impacts of the other countries and places around the world on australia's policy well i recall when australia was well when the when the uh when the liberals uh when the federal l p were designing um what became the narcotic drugs amendment um bill they traveled to canada and israel i believe to look to look at their medical cannabis framework and a few other jurisdictions as well uh some u.s states etc um and uh because you know at the end of the day if you're going to try and regulate something that you've never regulated before you've got nothing to go on in your own country you have to look overseas for for some examples you know even if they're bad examples or examples of what not to do right yeah um and and that's why new zealand that's why one way or another i think the new zealand bill proposed bill will be historically important because it's it's a very early uh stage uh recreational cannabis bill you know it's one of the few thoroughly designed recreational cannabis programs at the federal level in the world um and so people will be looking at that bill for years and years to come okay amazing well i don't have any other questions for you today is there anything else you wanted to say to those listening or watching uh yeah like even if even if the votes are no like um don't lose hope or don't you know don't don't um don't don't be too disappointed i mean i'm expecting the vote to be no um because i i think it's i think that's probably the more likely outcome uh and i prefer to be surprised rather than disappointed um but you know this isn't this isn't the be-all and end-all uh there are constant opportunities for reform in new zealand and in australia and everywhere else uh and this is you know one step um on the road um to uh to something that works better for everybody i think amazing awesome well as always reese it's been a pleasure thanks so much for joining me today and we look forward to having you back yeah

ehBMXTd6_Qg,Cannabis For Chronic Pain Explained By Dr Joe,2020-07-23T22:47:05Z,hi i'm dr joe costrich i'm gp and medical advisor to little green farmer today i'm here with honolee to talk about chronic pain and as part of that the potential role for medicinal cannabis a chronic pain is thought to affect as many as one in five um australians certainly wanting ten and the causes are many and varied so if you say what are the signs or symptoms it really depends what we're talking about if we're talking about chronic low back pain obviously the pain will be in the lower back it may be down the leg or either leg as well sometimes both people may experience chronic pain due to problems with their neck people may experience chronic pain in relation to migraine headaches they may experience chronic neuropathic pain for example a trigeminal neuralgia which affects the face some people may experience chronic abdominal pain in relation to perhaps prior surgery or in some instances conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease so pain i i think it's one of these words that's sort of difficult to describe in some respects but we all know what it is it's an unpleasant sensation in the body but it can affect any part of the of the body and you know necessarily um how people experience it is is different and relates to underlying cause and part of the body you know obviously if people get a bit of a headache and um they take a couple of perhaps paracetamol and it goes away then usually there's no particular need to to rush off to the doctor if people have a little bit of a sore throat and it lasts a few days and it's not getting worse then again um there's no particular need to go and see it you know see a doctor so generally the the advice and and probably advice is not the right word because it's so different for different people but if you have ongoing symptoms that certainly are not going away not responding to perhaps simple treatments and in particular getting worse even more so perhaps associated with other other symptoms so for example maybe it's it's pain but also fever or in the case of um you know back pain also pain down the legs you know that's when it's work that's what it's important to see the doctor and i suppose at any time if you're in doubt or or not sure there are different definitions but generally pain that is ongoing for minimum of three months some people use a definition of six months where generally treatment directed at the underlying cause of the pain you know is is not taking effect for example this might be a silly example but i think it could still be useful somebody has appendicitis now the appendix removed you're going to expect pain is going to what go away because the cause of the pain goes away when people have chronic pain it may be the case that despite treatment the pain doesn't go away and arthritis might be an example of that migraine headaches the same it can also be that no particular treatable cause is found for example somebody may have fibromyalgia and experience pain and there's no specific cause and there's no specific um treatment that's not to say people with fibromyalgia aren't treated but there's no specific treatment to the underlying condition so you know in that those situations again just just for example um the pain may become chronic and that it is ongoing and it's either not responding to treatment or there is no specific treatment yeah again i think it's always important to come back to cause so where possible and it isn't always possible i think that is an important point where possible and looks to treat the underlying condition not give inflammatory bowel disease and as an example there are specific medications for that and for those people where there is a good response the condition can improve doesn't mean it goes away but can improve and and their pain levels can be better controlled look when it comes to to chronic pain probably musculoskeletal pain and underlying that arthritic pain sometimes related to previous injuries you know are going to be the the commonest treatments probably divide into simplest you could say surgical and non-surgical for example with arthritis if it's severe enough people may have a hip or near other joint replaced there are other forms of surgery you know so for salt shoulder problems surgery is an option surgery is not generally first choice non-surgical will divide into a myriad of treatments that are pharmacological so they can be in medications either on prescription or over the counter there can be creams and rubs and gels and then you get into physical modalities such as massage physiotherapy and obviously exercises hydrotherapy you know even exercised in water you know so there's a lot of different approaches to you know to managing chronic chronic pain i'm going to start with the very simple over-the-counter medications that people can buy you then go through the prescription medications that are just regular prescriptions right through to to more potent medications and some of those come on on government authority so i suppose when we're going to that we're talking about some of the opiate medications they also divide into those for short-term use and those for long-term use you have what called immediate release formulations and sustained release formulations there's also anti-inflammatory medications and um you know other medications that are sometimes used off-label some of the um antidepressant and anti-epileptic medications are sometimes used in chronic pain and what's called off-label prescribing so people are always looking for um you know i suppose always looking for new new options because despite the different treatments that we have um you know not everybody gets the the response that they would like yeah look there's not a medication on the market that doesn't have side effects even simple paracetamol you know we'll cause some nausea reactions for some people it is fairly rare the anti-inflammatory tablets as a group will cause can cause stomach upset right through to the point of nausea and some of them including ibuprofen over the counter can saying it does can affect the kidneys and can affect blood pressure the the opiates have a significant number of side effects associated with them that doesn't mean that they can't be used or that everybody gets them um but yes constipation probably a major problem for a lot of people with opiates and a feeling of being sort of foggy people often say that they don't feel quite quite right um and addiction and indeed fatal overdose is a potential major problem with opiates we've seen the opioid crisis in america close to 70 000 uh you know deaths in 2017 from from usually these medications in australia it's not as many we do have a better system um so you know facilities in australia you know 2017 2018 something in the order of 17 1800 they're not all to do with opiates uh but you compare that to about 100 deaths from illicit medications and you can sort of see when we've got a bigger problem the other medication that's used quite a bit for nerve pain called progabalan again it works it has its role but often also find people so they just feel just foggy they describe their thinking as being a bit sort of strange they often people say just don't feel quite right again there's different meanings to different people yeah so medicinal cannabis can be used in australia where there is a role and it's been shown to be a benefit and there certainly is research internationally and you know now increasing research in australia about the fact that medicinal cannabis can help with chronic pain the other requirement is that other treatments have either failed to bring about improvement or have caused unacceptable side effects so it's not a first-line treatment and it's not for the person who's just sort of you know got a bit of a headache today and you know can i take this instead of paracetamol no you can't um and it's also not for people who have you know occasional pain and it's quite well controlled by the medications that they're on it is um i think as dr ross walker um put it it really is at this stage at least for the worst of the worst people got an ongoing chronic problem they've been through a number of treatments and this can include medications and you don't i should say people don't have to have exhausted every potential treatment that exists but they need to have tried and failed other you know standard or conventional better recognized treatments when that's happened then they can be considered for for treatment with medicinal cannabis again subject to some other requirements including that there's no major history of substance misuse that they're not allergic to cannabinoids and that um their general health and particularly living kidney function is acceptable and then you know consideration can be given that's that is many and varied the cga says it is approved for over 130 different conditions now something like 70 to 80 of those approvals after some form of chronic pain neuropathic pain so nerve pain um is probably the one where there's the most evidence for medicinal cannabis but musculoskeletal pain whether it's fibromyalgia whether it's arthritic type pain is also you know where it's used cancer pain is the other one i think that should be mentioned in that's in that sitting both cbd or cannabidiol and thc or deltamine tetrahydrocannabinol do have an analgesic effect so they they both can be helpful in pain and there is some suggestion that the combination is leads you to have a circle that's greater than the sum of the parts so formulations with both chc and cbd can be used in different you know in different sort of proportions and pure cbd can also be used and for those people in particular they're needing to drive then certainly in this country then the pure cbd is the way they tend to probably need to go in fact um and also you know employment for workplace testing notwithstanding as you said tom in a medicinal sense um it's not impossible but it's you know it's quite difficult to uh to get high you can't get high on a cbd formulation and it works as an analgesia now again if you sort of say the exact chemical mechanism the what we believe at the moment is that it is a a a partial agonist or it works around some of the nerve receptors and it affects some of the uh you know that we uptake of some chemical neurotransmitters now the exact mechanisms probably still you know i think they're still working to be done on that and i think we've got a bit of an idea we don't know exactly what we do know in the real world though is that you know there's a percentage of people are going to respond not every person this is a again i think it's an important point not every single person is prescribed medicinal candida is going to get benefit the same as for any other medication human beings are different some people respond very well some people respond and and some people some people don't i suppose thc is thought to work more directly on receptors at the end of nerve cells so when nerve cells connect with one another the middle is called a synapse you've got the end of one nerve cell in the beginning of the next and the message is passed on by the release of chemical transmitters from one nerve center in a cell and then picked up by the other and some of them gets gets reabsorbed signal perhaps so the thc is thought to work in part by acting on direct receptors cbd is not thought to bind directly to receptors and this is where it gets into it into an area where really i don't think anybody actually knows i think anybody who says they absolutely know what shall they do cbd is thought to work as a bit of a regulator so it somehow regulates the the movement release and re-uptake of these you know these neurotransmitters um to give you a case in in point if somebody has paraplegia and there's no nerve signal that can get from the leg up to the brain then you know they can have a lot of they can be hit on the leg for example but they're not going to feel the pain it's not that you know because they've had some of the pain isn't there they've been hit anybody who has you know nerves that are not cut will feel that pain so pain is something that we do interpret in the brain on the basis of the signals that we get from the from the body so we then get back to cbd somehow somehow it would appear to be doing something to the messages medicinal cannabis like all treatments can have side effects some people do get dry mouth some people do get a little bit of nausea some people do get um dizziness some people do get sedation now that's not always a problem um if people sleep better and often when people are medicinal candidates for chronic pain they report sleeping better and they can be a plus not a minus particularly if you take it in the evening um dry eyes fairly rare some people do describe a little bit of a fogginess or you know some alteration in their thinking not high as as such um but they're feeling a little bit vague um diarrhoea really quite rare um it's a relatively um it's a relatively benign medication in terms of side effects but look you know everybody is different and the more widely it's used the more well they will find but you know some people do get side effects that you know not been previously reported yeah cbd doesn't tend to be sedating so people don't tend to get uh sleepy with that although um some people do report sleeping better when they're on pure cbd so go figure there aren't any or again shouldn't be somebody you know it's always going to be the first any what we call cognitive or major psychological effects from uh from use of cbd as in people shouldn't necessarily should not expect to feel in any way vague or foggy or say look you know i can't quite remember where i put my keys those sorts of effects cbd is used to treat anxiety so it can and does have a calming effect but not in any way a um you know floating in inverted commas i don't want to use the word hike it does have certain connotations but yes people if they're on cohc formulations may um maybe sort of feel a bit floaty for one of the better term you know maybe a couple of feet off the ground not high up in the air if that's a useful analogy in australia oral formulations are far far and away the the most commonly used uh it could be 95 98 i haven't got an exact number in in north america inhaled forms and then use of dry flour probably more um more popular than in australia and again different jurisdictions sometimes develop different different cultures in an ideal world probably a combination of thc and cbd for chronic pain is likely to to work best and that's because the two cannabinoids work in together and there are some people who view that the combination often means you don't need to take as much medication uh some people feel that you know a pure cbd one might need anywhere between two and four times as much to achieve the same effect i really want to say that it's different again different for different people there's nothing as it is across the board um older people who are not driving with chronic pain then often a combination of thc and cbd is a logical starting point whether that's equal parts or cbd dominant is sometimes sometimes dependent on other factors rather than just the pain because they're both going to work pure cbd certainly does have a good analgesic effect and can equally be used it would certainly be used in younger people those who are needing to work and those who are driving there are some formulations that are thc dominant and they're generally not used first line they'll talk about medicinal cannabis not being first-line but high thc may be used where perhaps you know equal parts is not working or people are needing to increase their actual volume of medication so that one again probably second line it depends depends on individual and circumstances break breakthrough pain is sometimes managed by dividing the doses there is it's not done that widely in australia there is sometimes the case for using you know inhaled flour as a bit of a top up keeping in mind that for a chronic condition you want something that can maintain some more even concentration in the bloodstream there's also the case where people may be on different formulations they might be on a cbd formulation during the day and maybe at night time take something which has some chc so it's not always just on one form of medicinal cannabis so the the number of combinations possibly is as many as the number of different people although sure there are some you know more commonly used combinations but there's absolutely not one size fits all we don't have just one formulation that can be used and neither do we have a single dose which is the correct dose this is very different to to standard pharmaceuticals where there generally is a set dose and you know you're either on an x milligram tablet or a one milligram tablet because you know that's all there is it's an interesting area and i believe in europe um they use it more widely i would have to say it's not something i've personally prescribed um there are topical local anesthetic gels that already exist and they can be used locally it relies obviously on local effect topicals can be absorbed you know through the skin and there there's certainly some research being done into drug delivery methods for cannabis and one of the advantages of a topical putting in something topic which is through the skin is that you avoid what's called the first pass effect which is when it gets absorbed from the stomach something gets broken down in the liver so people may end up needing a slightly lower dose with widespread pain whether a topical formulation is going to be very practical or not as questionable there is work being done to try and see well could it be administered topically such that it gets absorbed into the bloodstream so the usual concept of a topical application would be say for a skin rash you put a cream on the rash and you treat the rash where it is the other example might be your antibiotic ear drops for an ear infection but there are patches that are used for opiates and they get absorbed through the skin rather than through the through the mouth so it's the chronic pain so the aim with topical cannabis medications would be similar to that such that it's not just treating the pain the international mantra is start low and go slow so generally with a with an oil i would be starting at half a mil or a quarter of a mill depending upon the strength of the formulation and titrating upwards to a point where there's adequate effect or uh where side effects are a problem and that principle or rationalism is the same with any medication so some people end up on you know half a mil or a million a half per day some people need more some people may take it in one or two doses some people might split it up more through the you know through the course of the day but very very personalized finding the dose that has the desired effect with hopefully none or minimal you know side effects and that's the dose of the person all the research that we've got says that it has a role and i think really it's about as simple as that it's not the panacea for everybody it's not going to work for everybody it's not necessarily going to take all the pain away that somebody has it can improve and does improve people's quality of life and part of that is by a direct analgesic effect some may also be through having and particularly with cbd a calming effect and in some instances perhaps helping with you know with sleep as well so the research tells us the medicinal cannabis has a role the legislation in australia tells us that that role applies where other treatments have failed or caused unacceptable side effects so it's it's relatively relatively uh you know clear-cut it is not for acute pain it's not pain it's well controlled by other treatments and it's not going to work for every single person who takes it thanks for joining us for today's interview about cannabis and chronic pain if you found this

JveN3tBJHHY,"Tincture, capsules, vape – what’s the best form of medicinal cannabis?",2020-05-14T05:50:02Z,in the legal system now we have a variety of ways we can give a patient medicinal cannabis the most common way is through an oral tincture so that's usually based in an oil or diluted in some sort of vegetable or plant-based or olive oil hemp seed oil and it contains the active ingredient of THC and CBD extracted from the plant we can also prescribe dried flower or buds for vaporization in Australia medical doctors aren't allowed to recommend smoking even though it is a way that cannabis is used throughout the world because it is irritant to the lungs it hasn't been shown to cause cancer like nicotine has but it does cause irritation so we recommend vaporization of that dried flower or Bud material the difference between those two I suppose is that oils last longer and don't lift the blood levels so high so we get a very smooth consistent application of the medicine and therapeutic effect when you inhale cannabis your blood level shoots up four to five times what it will be achieved from an oral dose very quickly and then drops off a lot quicker so you pull only get a two to four hour duration of action there's other methods of administration there's oral sprays which are designed to be absorbed erect Lee through the mouth there's some wafer technology just coming out in Australia that are designed to dissolve in the mouth and be absorbed very quickly and have good bioavailability not available in Australia yep and I'm sure they will be soon as the companies get their production together and importing together there's things like suppositories and vaginal pessaries there's patches that you can put on your skin and absorb through your skin so there's many methods of administration the main method I think is oils in Australia at the moment and capsules there's actually some gel caps which have the oils in them patients find them very easy to use they're used to taking pills and capsules especially the elderly so we can include them into their um their daily medicine packaging and they can just have in a one more little pill and it works for them but generally I find at the moment the main method administration I use is oral oils either mix the there as in CBD and THC already mixed in a certain ratio well sometimes I'll separate those two main components out so have one bottle high in THC one bottle high in CBD and then mix them in the body essentially this allows me as a doctor more fine-tuning of the dosing for the patient and if symptoms aren't under control with oral oils then I will usually add a vaporize product in so keeping the oils to maintain a steady baseline in the patient and then using the vaporized product to get get rid of breakthrough pain or for acute anxiety or for helping you get to sleep that sort of thing

dlp3pbl9SXY,Melissa Benson Explains Everything You Need To Know About Cannabis Clinical Trials,2020-10-06T22:37:05Z,hi i'm melissa benson uh i'm the gm of applied cannabis research and today i'm here talking to holly about cannabis clinical trials we're going to be talking about what a clinical trial is what is the differences between cannabis clinical trials and others and also what cannabis clinical trials are happening here in australia so a clinical trial is basically just an experiment uh it's how you're able to answer a research question so your question might be how you know does this drug help with my inflammation if you have arthritis so a clinical trial is a great way to actually test that and the way that you set up a clinical trial is that you you have the the thing that you want to test and then you have a control group and you choose a measure so it might be swelling if you're an arthritis patient and then you would test in the group that gets the drug versus the group without the drug did they have a difference in swelling and that really is the definitive way you can answer a research question like that um and and that is the essence of what a clinical trial is so there are two basic types of clinical trials you have interventional or non-interventional also known as observational studies interventional studies is where you have a defined protocol and you intervene and define how the patient will be managed in that clinical trial so that might be the visit selection it could be different procedures that the patient undergoes and it also includes the specific the drug or the dosing that you're going to be giving that particular patient so an example of an interventional study is an rct or a randomized control trial that is the gold standard of clinical trials so a randomized control trial is typically placebo-controlled or it's controlled by an active comparator so that means you can either have two groups or each patient receives either drug and placebo and and this just allows you to make direct comparisons about the drug and how it is acting relative to a placebo so for those who also don't know a placebo basically looks exactly the same as an active drug and you wouldn't be able to tell any difference except it's missing the active ingredients that are in the drug so a randomized control trial is an example of an interventional study but you also have non-interventional or observational studies observational studies are where you don't intervene at all in a participant's care so all we're doing is collecting research that's not intervening with how their existing care is happening under the under their doctor so some examples of that are happening right now with patients who are being prescribed to medicinal cannabis and we are just collecting patient data um both from the patients themselves and also from the clinicians and then that information obviously can be used and and we can conduct research analysis on that as well clinical trials are really important because they're the key way that you can prove scientifically if a drug has an effect on this particular condition that you want to see the effect so the way that you define that effect you can you compare between either the placebo or your control group and then also the active drug group but then in an observational type study you might be comparing before and after the drug so clinical trials address kind of three key things they address safety and so they're looking obviously at any side effects patients are reporting but also any potential drug drug interactions they have with other drugs that they might be taking they also look at efficacy or the effectiveness of the drug and then they also assess dose and dose range which is a really key thing to understand for for efficacy and also for prescribing i guess clinically proven um in a typical you know traditional pharmaceutical sense is a drug that you know if it's registered to be prescribed that's when we would say it's clinically proven to be registered uh you as i mentioned before there's kind of those different five phases of clinical trials so typically a registration submission would require information from phase one phase two and phase three studies so you need to be able to show that it's safe you've demonstrated that you understand the toxicity limits um of the doses of the drug and how frequently people can have the drug you understand the expected adverse events and the side effects of that drug and then you also need to prove that that drug is effective for treating the condition that you've shown and that typically is compared to either a placebo or another drug on the market for example if there's already another drug on the market if you're looking at antidepressants you need to show that your drug is better than an existing antidepressant or that it's as good as an existing antidepressant but has a better side effect profile so that's kind of your burden of proof to be able to get your drug registered in australia currently um there's only one medicinal kind of like cannabis based drug registered that's sativex which is a one to one thc cbd spray and it's registered for the treatment of multiple sclerosis specifically pain and spasms in those patients so they have you know fulfilled that burden of proof and that particular drug has been registered for that condition um in in america for example the fda has approved epidialex for certain pediatric epilepsies they're quite rare epilepsies where if patients are treatment resistant you know they've tried all of the existing anti-epileptic drugs epidialex which is a cbd dominant or cbd only product it has been registered for treatment of those two lennox gastro and drug a syndrome and i believe it's also currently being considered for registration here in australia which we will find out about later this year so that question is a tricky question i don't think anyone has a great idea of the number but uh for example if we look at the tga guidance documents which is kind of what's um led to medicinal cannabis being allowed as a an unregistered medicine in australia they cite over 350 different studies and of those studies about half of them or at least 150 of them are randomized controlled trials there are different trial registries so these are public registries where anyone can go and have a look so there's clinicaltrials.gov is the large one in the u.s here in australia we have the australian new zealand clinical trial registry so if you go and search uh thc or cbd in those studies uh in those registries sorry you often get you know over a hundred current clinical studies it really comes down also to intellectual property so when i say motivation i mean also financial motivation so a traditional pharmaceutical company they create this new novel molecule that they want to register and they think that this will be great at treating depression so what they can do is they can protect that molecule with a patent so their intellectual property is protected and they have a period of you know 20 years where that is their protected property and no one else is able to impede upon that so by the time they've done all of their phase you know phase one to phase three and they've registered their product they usually have you know five to ten years of exclusive market share where they're the only ones allowed to produce that product and the only ones allowed to have that prescribed for that particular indication cannabis is very different because you are not able to patent a naturally occurring compound so in that sense you know someone cannot come along and patent cbd so those same motivations like you don't have that ability to capture all of the money that you've spent on those large scale studies back because you don't have that market exclusivity so i guess in this sense you know you have company a and company b that both do medicinal cannabis products um there's not really any reason why company a would go and spend all their money and time conducting all of these clinical trials and you know then they have this massive research and development outlay and then when they get to the point of being able to register the product for example here in australia if their product is a cbd only oil you know there's 50 other cbd only oils that could basically piggyback off that research and get the benefit but they haven't had to outlay all of that research and development money so it's really it's kind of it's a monetary motivation and it's not great to say that but you're kind of asking a company to put all of that money out with no assurance that they'll be able to get it back like you can in a traditional pharmaceutical development pathway which is why especially those phase three clinical trials which are the really expensive studies that's why they're basically obsolete in the medicinal cannabis space this is as we said this is kind of really unique to medicinal cannabis and it really impedes you know you constantly hear there's not enough evidence we need the evidence base especially from regulators that's the key thing they say to expanding patient access but also to clinicians we have a lot of the you know the medical colleges who are hesitant about prescribing medicinal cannabis and they want those large studies but i guess the problem is they understand we understand what the problem is we need those large studies but we don't have a mechanism to fund those large studies and there's no real reason why you know one medicinal cannabis company should do it alone so i think touching on what you said i think this is a kind of a unique problem where we need a unique solution um whether that be that you know the government needs to step in because they realize that this is not something that you know private enterprise is going to fund themselves maybe we need to have you know more of a syndicated project where you know companies who have cbd products that are interested in this same indication can somehow create you know a new uni a new and unique clinical trial that kind of has some government funding so that then everybody can share the costs but everyone can also share the benefits um which is very different from how traditional pharmaceutical registration happens and i think we're trying to put an old framework onto a new problem and no one's really providing a solution as to how we're going to overcome this because it seems very unlikely that regulators will all of a sudden not require this level of evidence and so you know if they're not going to budge on the level of evidence we need to find a way to be able to get that evidence that isn't going to send you know a certain company bankrupt just because they're the ones wanting to to try and fulfill that that gap so i think because we have this problem where doing large scale you know phase three clinical trials is really not feasible currently that's where observational research which that's the thing typically again this is very unique because in a traditional pharmaceutical sense you could never do observational research because your drug isn't allowed to be prescribed so here we kind of have this unique way you know in australia for example we have over 18 000 patients receiving medicinal cannabis and so you kind of have a large cohort where you could already be collecting important observational research and of course it's not the same quality it's not the same control level um and as we see with you know a large rct but it's far less expensive it's a more realistic option for what we can actually do given the current circumstances so that's why observational research especially um if we can create really large data sets will be really powerful because it's kind of a good bartering chip to say this is what we can do unless you can facilitate us being able to do this other type of study and provide a solution yeah so i think the tga generally looks to the rest of the world especially you know the european nations and the fda they look to see what's happening in those really large markets and that kind of guides what what happens for them um in that sense they are i mean australia is actually we're quite at the forefront of research in this area patient access is definitely like more restricted than in other countries but not necessarily in the way that you might think for example in the uk you know that you can kind of get easy access to these low-dose cbd products but in fact getting a prescription for medicinal cannabis in the uk is so much harder than here in australia they're kind of where we were you know almost 18 months two years ago really where it was a really big struggle it's a very challenging prescribing process so it appears like they have you know easy access but in fact if you if you don't want the products that are available it's more challenging the us is kind of a weird unique example where you know cannabis is still illegal federally but then of course you have states that allow um legal medicinal cannabis and sometimes also for recreational purposes so that has actually hindered a lot of research coming out of the united states because for the longest time because of the federal restrictions a lot of clinical trials and a lot of clinical research can't happen there so for a long period all they could access is the um the products that are that are uh like medicinal cannabis uh products that are available from the dea so of course that restricted a lot of different companies who might have unique you know novel formulations or novel technologies or novel um cannabinoid or terpene profiles they're not able to actually do clinical research in america so even though it looks like their patient acts access is expanded it's quite disparate to what's actually happening in the research setting so in that sense australia is quite far forward in the research setting and we are doing a lot of clinical trials for overseas companies for that reason because you know we're already a great hub for clinical trials just generally in australia um and then because of the the pathways we have in place already with prescribing um and and with the clinical trial schemes here we're able to do clinical trials that they can't do in the us so australia um we actually have some really interesting driving studies that have been conducted so i guess these aren't you know specific to a medical condition but these are really important for all patients who are taking medicinal cannabis so here in australia we obviously have a driving restriction for any patient who has thc whether it's medicinally prescribed or not and the big question is how much is it impairing patients driving and that's obviously a massive restriction to a patient if you know they want to treat their pain but then their driving ability is taken away from them so there's been some really great studies um completed out of the university of sydney and also some studies down at swinburne university that have focused on driving um and they also a current study right now that's happening is focused on cbd only because there is still kind of this vague um you know people don't want to say that cbd is completely safe to drive and until you actually test it and show that that's the case um it's still kind of this unknown so in terms of driving studies australia is actually you know leading quite quite significantly in that area there is also another group down in melbourne at the origin youth center for mental health this is a large nhmrc funded center and this center has a lot of psychologists and psychiatrists treating primarily youth so they see a lot of patients you know between 15 and 25 and for a whole range of um you know refractory or treatment resistant anxiety or treatment resistant depression but also some problems um with uh addiction so addiction is a really interesting area that's kind of emerging specific to cbd um some research is also happening in in the states about this but there are some this group down in melbourne this kind of large conglomerate and they are looking at a lot of new studies in these areas i touched on these before but there are publicly available clinical trial registries so the anz ctr is the australian and new zealand clinical trial registry so you can go there and you can search for you know any particular product and you'll find all of the current clinical trials and the completed ones it's a little bit um i guess it's a little bit scary and not that user friendly especially for patients so we have actually created like a nice concise list of all of the current studies here in australia um which is on our website and we're really hoping to keep that updated so it's a nice resource for patients to be able to go there and you can see all of the different studies and then have links to to contacting those studies if you're interested in participating and there is studies happening almost in every state in australia so um and and there's also opportunities for some of the newer observational studies to be done by telehealth and you know people are quite adapting um in this area so so that's definitely a great place to go um some universities that have a focus in clinical trials also sometimes have a clinical trials list but it's a little bit more challenging to navigate so there are kind of two two groups of people that can be involved in medicinal cannabis clinical trials uh healthy volunteers are a group that are needed as well as patients who have some kind of chronic condition so healthy volunteers are people that might be really interested in the space and and want to volunteer and be part of research and those are the things like the driving studies that we mentioned you know those are seeking healthy volunteers um people are also conducting pharmacokinetic studies which is looking at the drugs and how they distribute throughout the body so that's a way in which healthy people can be involved patients with chronic conditions that might already be prescribed to medicinal cannabis i would say for those patients the best way is to discuss it with their doctor whichever doctor is prescribing the medicinal cannabis to them they will be the most informed on potential studies that they could be involved in and there are a number of large observational studies happening here in australia that are exactly for those patients um there are also a number of studies that are very specific to different indications you know a whole bunch of studies on different sleep disorders with insomnia and we have listed all of those on the acr database and we've also put the links there to the specific groups that are doing all of those studies so a lot of them have like an online contact form so you can fill out your information and then this study group would contact you we also realized that there is a group who you know there's not always a clinical trial happening in every different disease that you might want to be involved in so we are also going to be including we also have created like an online expression of interest form so that we can keep you updated if um there is any new trials in that area that you might want to want to know about thanks for joining us for today's interview with melissa benson about cannabis clinical

EH6BLKyQVqc,The Differences in Regulation &amp; Quality Between Local and Imported Cannabis Products in Australia,2020-08-19T22:59:16Z,hey everyone tom brown here for episode 2 of this month in cannabis and this month in cannabis we're going to talk about medical cannabis regulations and the differences between local and imported products to do that i'm here with steven notaro the head of legal and regulatory affairs at kang group limited australia thanks for joining us today steve it's a pleasure a lot i'm very well thank you and i really appreciate you taking the time out so before we actually get started talking about the regulatory requirements and everything can you tell us a little bit about yourself your role at ken group and and anything else you'd like to inform us um my journey with kang group started in uh late part of 2014 which was um prior to the amendments of the narcotic drugs act which um in fact legalized cultivation and medicinal cannabis in australia so things have changed quite a lot since then but um on a day-to-day basis i guess my main role is to ensure the company remains um compliant with all the laws and regulations um relevant to medicinal cannabis that's both locally and internationally and as an extension i guess the other part that's quite important is that wherever possible myself and my team and the broader group do champion for change and development in the industry wherever possible to both support patient access and the development of the medicinal cannabis industry in australia so we do that either you know representing canned group but we're also a member of the mcia as well which is a fantastic industry association which helps to move forward the causes of medicinal cannabis both for patients and industry all right steve yeah that sounds like a very broad and interesting uh role and an interesting space to be in um so to get us started can you give us an overview of where medicinal cannabis products that are currently available in australia are sourced from absolutely so in australia the regulatory framework for supply medicinal cannabis products it does for local manufacturers require a number of state and federal bodies and there are a number of requirements in satisfying each of those bodies before you can become operational so there is a time and effort in obtaining those approvals and thereafter there's also additional time and effort in actually developing your product having them tested and having them released into the market as a result we've found that um the initial products available to australian patients were those that were have been imported from overseas sources and that's primarily canada but also countries such as israel and the uk while our local industry developed and made its way through those requirements and undertook that development work now fortunately we're um we're seeing that um a growing number of australian companies can group included have successfully navigated through that system and therefore the australian market and australian patients are on a are starting to become supplied more and more by australian manufactured products great great absolutely and i think we're all looking forward to having more australian manufactured products in the local market so can you tell us a little bit about uh what the process to become a licensed cultivator and manufacturer of cannabis products in australia is so in australia we need to have a well we have a licence and permit system that focuses on two main aspects one is the suitability of those who operate the business there is very stringent uh fin and proper person requirements to make sure that the director's offices those conducting the business those who are controlling the business are doing so for the appropriate reasons and thereafter there's also a second set of um requirements that go more towards the operational suitability of the business does it have the right facility does it have the right standard operating procedures the right security measures in place to ensure that it will conduct the business in an appropriate manner and separately this is treated as a therapeutic good in australia for the traditional requirements of manufacturing under good manufacturing practices having a license and certificate associated with it also apply so we also have the um the licences issued through the tga as well that have to operate together to get from from a plant that's cultivated through to the manufacturing process and then supply onto the patient and it is very patient focus in australia we um in comparison to other countries cannot cultivate speculatively so we all always have to have a very defined line of sight between a request of the federal government to allow us to cultivate a certain number of plans or strains to having a connection through to a manufacturer who wants to accept them to manufacture products to having actual market at the other end that's um expected to be available to supply into so the concept of stockpiling and establishing the market doesn't exist in australia it is very much cultivation for the purpose of manufacturing into products for patient supply can you maybe explain some of the specific quality and assurance guidelines for cultivating and manufacturing cannabis products in australia yeah sure um so i might do so i might do so even by comparison between australia and overseas markets as well i think it's a useful way to to view the um absolutely the quality of our products so when we're going through the quality assurance guide guidances and requirements uh i think we have to start with the understanding that we are uh purely a medicinal market only and as such um the focus needs to be on patient access and um and and patient treatment and and you know our laws and regulations are based on that premise so to achieve this we have to consider a number of sometimes competing elements but against that primary consideration of patient quality and safety we do have the cost of patients to consider we do have the fact that we have a a new industry to support so you know balancing up those considerations um the fact that we're signatory to international convention um and the fact that it is an illicit drug that um has some value in the in a know illicit markets as well so matters of um of uh diversion into those illicit markets has to be balanced up against those other considerations so on the first point the um product quality uh the tga has issued a number of therapeutic goods orders to guide and regulate the product quality uh the the primary order is um therapeutic goods order number 93 it's called it's a standard for medicinal uh cannabis now importantly this is one that is an order that applies both the locally manufactured products and imported products equally it looks at the um the quality of the um even the starting material that the cannabis plant that went into the manufacture of the end product uh the ingredients that went into the product and then the um steps and the procedures in the manufacturing and the resultant uh quality of the the product that's going to be supplied into the market so uh i think it's it's critical to understand that that is the case that it's it's an order that applies for all medicinal cannabis products supplied in the australian market irrespective of whether they're manufactured here or not okay great well so so if tga 93 applies equally across the board local and imported what are the actual differences between local and imported products then yeah i think uh in one word oversight this this is um an order that um is required but addressed by way of declaration by the manufacturer there you know there's a particular form to sign before you release a product called a therapeutic goods order declaration and and that's signed by the manufacturer stating that they do meet the requirements of the therapeutic goods order uh that they do have the certificates of analysis in place that they do have the stability data in the background to support the the claim of the shelf life on the product however and very similar to taxation it's some self-declaration so it does require the tga to actually check that um that the claims made by the manufacturer are in fact true now as i'm sure you can appreciate that's uh far easier to manage um in australia with australian manufacturers and what it might be for an unknown manufacturer overseas so i'm not an investigator at the tga but um i could tell you that um in australia our local manufacturers are inspected directly by the tga they're audited from time to time they are that likewise the office of drug control that deals with the other side of the federal legislation ensures that the uh the appropriate people are operating the business in accordance with um the rules that have been established by that particular federal government department making sure that the um the strengths being cultivated are legitimate strains that it is only those strains at that facility they're going into the manufacture of the of the drug not additional biomass coming in from other sites which we know anecdotally and otherwise and even report it has happened overseas the grey market introduction of um new material into manufactured sites so there is some two government bodies that are very very tightly monitoring and regulating the cultivation and manufacture of medicinal cannabis because of its nature as a narcotic plant as well as the fact that it is a therapeutic drug and they're doing that at the same very high standards that we've come to expect of any therapeutic good manufactured in australia gotcha and can you just clarify so when a product is imported from overseas whether that be flower or other is there any requirement for it to be tested here in australia before it goes out to patients there's a requirement the manufacturer has to test the product themselves okay two the standard set out in the therapeutic goods order now the therapeutic goods administration has the ability to request a sample of the imported product to test themselves to see whether it meets the claims made in that therapeutic goods order my understanding is to date that the only aspect they test is the potency and the other aspects of product quality are currently being tested so there is a very real gap as i mentioned there is um there's ample opportunity for uh for deviations from an acceptable you know product pathway to occur before the manufacturing side as well knowing where the source material has come from so on and so forth and ensuring that you know the same checks and balances that we have in australia are met in overseas manufactured products is difficult now so you know up to this point we've talked about a lot of differences in importation versus locally grown and the requirements the q a why do these differences exist so the reality is that the the differences shouldn't exist they're merely allowed to exist for the reasons mentioned before the um the difference in the oversight that can occur in australia compared to for imported products um it is unfortunate it is a it is something that can group along with a number of other licence holders um have identified as being a an issue and an issue that affects australian patients um as a result there was the establishment of our industry association um known as the mcia they have released a code of conduct which addresses this very issue and um and it is a voluntary code where where can and others who are part of the mcia have committed to ensuring full compliance with um the very high quality standards that are expected of um of the australian producers and that we expect of ourselves as well we hope that that flows through to having confidence in australian-made products both the patients and medical practitioners who are treating patients with medicinal cannabis products that they they know that if um if the product is australian produced if it is specifically from an mcia member um that those very high quality standards can be guaranteed earlier you talked about the balancing of patient access and and balance between the the different organizations tga and the office of narcotics drugs and narcotics um do you feel that those regulations and the is actually correct at the moment it's an interesting probably a critical question and it's one that was um addressed quite recently with a review that was mandated by the narcotic drugs act to occur two years after its implementation that there need to be a review of the um of the operation of the narcotic drugs act so what what came out of that was that there is there is a burden on the industry uh yeah that i think it was quite clear from that review that um the current laws were over overly regulated uh my personal view is that that over regulation comes mostly from the over sensitivity to the mitigation of um of risk of diversion that the regulators are taking too strong of you on on the security measures and the checks and balances need to be put in place for the cultivation side noting that there are a number of other checks along the way such as the the gmp requirements and they supply pathways into that are already established through the sas system and so on so forth so my strong view is that um that the balance is too far towards mitigating a um unrealised risk of diversion of cannabis and as a result it doesn't support the streamline cultivation and manufacture of a product in a way that can get those products into the hands and patients in a more timely manner and in a more cost-effective manner um as a result of that review the office of drug control is going to be implementing a a new licensing system which replaces the current three license system with a single license model so it's our hope that under that new license model some of that regulatory burden is reduced and we do see improved patient access to australian manufactured drugs do you see that these um requirements at some point will become the same or at least uh watched in the same way and tested and made sure that products will actually all meet the same requirements that are that are being delivered to patients i think it's going to be difficult for for our local regulators to ever regulate imported products in the same regulars what they can regulate australian-made products likewise we we are a company that um is intending to export products and in the reverse i think that's going to be true of the countries that we import into all right steve well this has been really insightful i really appreciate your time i don't have any other questions for you so before you go would you like to tell people how they can connect with you or follow you sure um thanks for your time as well tom and if you want to connect

hs2cc_UZww4,Australian medicinal cannabis industry on cusp of major expansion | ABC News,2021-12-19T06:35:33Z,this is what legal cannabis looks like on an industrial scale with 40 staff and plans to hire 60 more this is big business this is a cannabis plant and it's one of 3 000 in this greenhouse overall we have another 10 000 plants growing outdoors as well so 13 000 at the moment today is harvest day in a greenhouse designed to grow the best cannabis flowers possible so every one of these plants is a clone and that is how we're controlling the consistency of the output for ceo dan howard the pungent smell and the sight of so much cannabis is normal has recently moved from canada where cannabis is legal so from the medical market evolved the adult use market and that has now proliferated across the country with thousands and thousands of stores and hundreds of producers producing government controlled taxed and high-quality cannabis across the country do you see what happened in canada also occurring here in australia i believe australia's on a similar path confidence in the future of the market has companies spending big millions of dollars in development means this company is about to upgrade from this greenhouse to this one to date most medicinal cannabis consumed in australia has been imported from overseas but industry says this is changing as patient access to product is streamlined and new regulation levels the playing field for domestic producers josie hamlet who manages compliance says these changes are a good start but the rules are complex and inconsistent there's been a lot of permit and license reforms which has definitely made our life easier here instead of having like three licenses and six permits with the they've all been rolled into one ultimately this complexity impacts people like peter fielding who was diagnosed with esophagus cancer two years ago he's been using medicinal cannabis and says the drug works wonders it doesn't save your life but it certainly helps to extend it i was given four months i'm now up to 23 months and about five days not that i'm counting mr fielding says getting it remains difficult and expensive even though it's legal now try finding somebody who can prescribe it legally try finding one it's still a problem a growing industry for a growing need david barnett clement abc news you

k6T4LpsWI6Y,Travelling With Medical Cannabis in Australia (Locally) Explained by Lawyer Andrew Dowling,2021-05-10T04:05:34Z,hey everyone andrew dowling here i'm a practicing lawyer and the co-founder of ultmed and cbd pharmaceuticals today i'm with honolee and i'm talking about traveling within australia with medical cannabis i hope you find this video useful enjoy yeah they can so all states in australia um have now to varying degrees um got access to medicinal cannabis so because medicinal cannabis is a prescription only medicine at this point in time it's really advised that you know the patients do carry some level of paperwork with them to support that as long as they've got a prescription for it that extends also to um to flower as well um you know you might find yourself at an airport if you if you are carrying flower attracting the attention of you know of snipper dogs and the like but you know the whole way that our legal framework is is structured is that you in having a permit and having a doctor that's given that medical opinion that you need that product um and has provided you with a prescription you are permitted to have that product look it shouldn't uh i i'm you know i'm not i had to look around to try to do some research on this point um there's no guidelines that i was able to discern that are available on this but um i don't know if one method is is necessarily better or worse than than the other but the point is that you know whether you're based in in perth or wherever you are in australia and you're traveling somewhere else you are permitted to carry that because all state jurisdictions in australia have now been harmonized with the federal or the commonwealth narcotics act um so we we have a fully legal medicinal cannabis scheme in australia is the point and if you are obtaining it legally and have obtained it from a doctor through buyer a prescription then you are permitted to travel with it yeah so um when you know when patients obtain a product legally you know it has to come via the various pathways which are administered by the tga so that's the special access scheme or the authorized prescriber scheme but the end result of that from the patient side is that a prescription is sent to a pharmacy and you know that patient is effectively approved to have that medicine dispensed to them on advice from their doctor and i mentioned that the prescription label i think is really important i don't know why anyone would necessarily do this but if you were to say get the product and tear off that prescription label that's that actually lists your name and the dosage and all of that really key information i guess it's probably a bit difficult for um you know authorities to really see whether or not that's a black market product so i would i would highly recommend keeping that prescription i imagine that in some cases um authorities may wish to actually you know check that the person named on that prescription product is actually the person carrying it and seeking to travel with it so they might you know conduct further id checks um in terms of having a letter from a doctor i certainly couldn't find anything that was authoritative to suggest that that's a legal requirement in any sense but i think it's a good idea if um you know you know people often go to their doctor to get a sick certificate and they don't realize that you know doctors are there to help with a broad range of of patient inquiries so if you say to your doctor hey i'm actually due to travel to um you know to darwin for you know a couple of weeks on these dates and i'd like to travel with um with the medicinal cannabis that you provided me um so that i you know have documentation to show any authorities that that you know are interested in in seeing that um could you please provide me with a letter and i think you'd be hard-pressed to have your trading gp who's prescribed that product knock you back for that request well i suppose the yeah the scope of what they're allowed to carry is really the scope of what's in the prescriptions so whatever the doctor has prescribed is really what they're permitted to carry so i guess to the extent that if the device that's used to consume the product is authorized by the doctor yes and maybe that forms something of a gray area that might actually just be included in the doctor's letter you know the doctor might say i've prescribed him this flower product um i understand that they are using uh you know a vape to consume that flower i'm really not not entirely sure but i just know that from from a purely legal perspective the framework has been set up but you know they're all prescription medicines at this point in time we do facilitate um access to them and they are permitted for you know being taken between state and territory jurisdictions in australia um but the yeah the vaping question i think is probably best dealt with if it's if it doesn't form part of that what's within the scope of what's permitted by the doctor and prescribed by the doctor it's probably best dealt with in the accompanying or supporting letter that a doctor might write to it to assist a patient that is a really yeah that's a really interesting question um i look i mean if you have documents and and you this is a legal product i i mean you're that's the same as somebody taking a couple of neurofins outside the airport right like i mean obviously different in the sense that it's prescription but you know we don't necessarily um police that kind of activity however um you know i suppose to the extent that your smoking is harming other people if it's in the vicinity of other people i think it's really um you know that that could perhaps draw a bit of ire from from security staff at an airport or something like that i think i think your safest bet is to you know to travel with it but to consume it as privately and and you know discreetly um as you can purely so that you're not actually um having any other person ingest the the vapor or anything like that i mean you know when people do take other schedule 8 products or you know prescription products it's not as though you're you know having any of what they're having so i think it's um that's probably the best advice i can give but in terms of whether or not there are any hard and fast laws or rules on that um no nothing that i've come across today um i mean the packaging and the storage that the the medicines come in um you know the they're generally compliant um with you know australian packaging standards although they're not legally necessarily required to be if they're an unapproved therapeutic good but i won't take you down that rabbit hole but um needless to say they're usually um protected in a you know a sort of a you know an opaque um plastic bottle or it could be a glass bottle for a tincture um look it's not like uh we have laws with respect to firearms for example and it must be stowed you must you know stow your firearm if you have a gun license in in a specific cabinet and you know as far as i am aware i've never heard of travelers needing to take any specific storage facility that they they carry it in and the packaging um should suffice but um of course you know um this is really a you know very much a non-legal observation but i don't know if anyone's ever you know traveled with say a bottle of wine and didn't seal it properly and you know they they got to their destination with uh shiraz all over their shirts or something like that you know you don't want to be in a situation like that so i guess the best advice i can give to people traveling with a tincture bottle is just make sure it's you know bubble wrapped or something like that but no no no legal requirements for storage yeah um so i guess you know if you're first of all the product needs to be legal and in order for it to be a legal product it you know it will have to be supported with a prescription um and ideally you know i guess there's no such thing really as too much preparation um in this context especially given that you know we're still dealing in the um i guess the the night we're in the nascent stages of you know cannabis in australia so there will actually be people in law enforcement who are unfamiliar with the legal status of you know some some people might not even be aware that we have a framework that permits access to legal medicinal cannabis and so i think it's really important that you not only have a label a prescription medicine that's properly labeled that has your name you know what you've been prescribed as a dosage but also that you know where possible have have a letter from a doctor because that um also you know just provides further support and and you know that might that letter might and it's not it's certainly not a requirement but you know it might simply just be the doctor saying yeah i um prescribed um tom this product to treat insert name of condition um you know the dosage is x and and they just give that sort of that background information and um you know i monitor i'm you know seeing him that that sort of information like i don't know um it's not necessarily a case of less is more the more information i just feel like that that would help someone who is um you know going to be uh subject to stigma and all that sort of thing that we've seen in the industry in the last few years since it started you

down in price with more cannabis clinics entering the market application fees have also seen a reduction a quick google search reveals charts such as this one by honahlee, providing an easy price comparison option  although we have seen a reduction in costs the average spend for a patient is still unattainable for those who need it most   in our previous video we documented the struggle 
you may face when speaking with old-fashioned gp's   a lot of cannabis clinics are now offering 
internal referral options to avoid this added stress  so today we'll be reviewing aussie grown 
rocky which is a 30 thc less than one percent cbd indica flower  antg rocky is a fairly new product

the tilray thc cbd oral oil it was $280   for 40 mls? 40 mls. so with direction here it says to use 0.1 grams 
three times a day as directed by your doctor  this is for the antg rocky indica flower for
the oil it's suggested to use   0.25mls twice a day as directed by 
your doctor and that's for the thc and cbd oil so it's came with a seal for protection 
and i'm just going to open it this way yeah   a lot of dust on the top that smells really lemony all right we'll pull out some buds so we can 
pull them apart have a look on the inside so you can see all the trichomes 
in there it's a lot more than on the outside you can see the trichomes 
as well flying everywhere it's very dry so it's a bit hard to break apart a little bit but it's got a lot of trichomes 
on the inside of each bud so for first impression it smells   quite lemony.. you can see the trichomes on the 
actual flower buds themselves  and there's not  as many hairs as normal which is normally a 
good sign as well for my understanding anyway so it seems to me a lot of small buds rather 
than a lot of bigger buds   there's not a lot of stems from what i can see here  and there is a lot of trichomes on these flowers so you can it from quite a distance so you can see the trichomes 
falling off as i'm breaking it apart   and along with it being all on 
my gloves as i'm playing with it but there is a lot of trichomes on 
the inside as well.. it is frosty as   so looking at the bud you can see that there 
is..  it's still got quite a bit of sugar leaves   on it which is just these things here that 
could be trimmed a little bit better but,   it's packed full of trichomes so even with the 
sugar leaves it's covered in trichomes it's fine as you can see all the tricom's there 
along with it on my gloves and falling off this is very good quality but there is a lot 
more little buds than there are larger buds so   the two buds that i've pulled apart are the 
only two buds that are quite big in there but yeah lots of tricones a lot more 
trichomes obviously on the inside you can see the trichomes falling off it or 
something like it's very  it's quite powdery for it being so solid this is chronic as F"
T5CdKpRuvAQ,Fired For Using Medicinal Cannabis: Australia’s First Federal Case,2021-12-22T01:20:18Z,hey everyone tom brown here co-founder of honolee and today we're going to talk about employee rights and medicinal cannabis in a moment you'll meet mitchell rice a medicinal cannabis patient who was employed by queensland rail as a rail worker after doing the right thing and speaking with his employer about his medicinal cannabis consumption mitch was initially stood down and terminated a few months later now mitch is taking on queensland rail in an unlawful termination case alleging discrimination as a medicinal cannabis patient this case could play a big role in improving employ employee rights for medicinal cannabis patients australia-wide mitch's first hearing was on the 14th of december and today we're going to get an update from mitch and his lawyer jeremy kennedy thanks for joining me today guys good morning thomas how's it going thomas great thanks for being here um so let's just jump straight into it so mitch can you give us a bit of background on your reasons for using medicinal cannabis uh yeah i started using medicinal cannabis late last year as an alternate measure to previous sleeping pills i'd been prescribed so i mean i'd pretty much take these sleeping pills the night before and i'd wake up with some negative side effects i was looking for an alternate medicine um something that made me feel a bit better in the morning and i came across medical cannabis so i've pretty much been using that since late last year um largely through a vaporizer so you just pretty much inhale it through a vaporizer before bed that just aids and assists my sleep okay thanks for that mitch so can you talk us through uh the process that you went through with queensland rail for your drug testing oh yes so essentially it's just um random drug testing and um in my case with the drug and alcohol policy i had an oral swab test so just uh just swabbing your gums and around your mouth and all that and yeah the the limits for thc are 25 micrograms so yeah essentially had an oral swab test and it came up not negative so okay that makes sense and and and jeremy it sounds like they're just testing for presence rather than anything else how does that um sit in terms of you know other medications and how that should work in the workplace well thomas the the key legal question is around whether or not mitchell would be impaired in the workplace from a work health and safety point of view and whether that impairment would put himself at risk or others at risk in the workplace that's the key legal question about mitchell's situation whether he would have been impaired not whether or not he had a registered thc level and that's the problem with the policy that queensland rail have implemented uh it doesn't deal with the issue of impairment uh and it's it's uh it's not how it should be there's certainly many other prescription medications that staff are required to declare which they do but the question then is are they impaired not whether or not they have that drug in their system and this is this is a very similar issue to what we have with the the kind of medicinal cannabis and drug driving laws so it you know this is i think something that a lot of people can relate to um jeremy can you talk a little bit about why chamberlain's took on this case and why you feel that mitch does have a strong case so yeah tommy simon i'm a workplace lawyer and we see this as a very significant issue it's a approved prescription drug in many states in australia and we feel that there is a real stigma attached to the use of that prescription medication and society needs to change their attitudes and employers need to change their attitudes to be reflective of where of the status of this drug now in the community absolutely and and so um you know i think this uh this situation happens a lot more than people often think mitch can you tell us what made you decide to take it further um i essentially like broken my heart getting into this sort of situation where i've lost my job so yeah my job meant so much to me and i didn't really want anyone else to be in this sort of situation um i largely felt like i was left in the dark this whole kind of process so there was a lot of uncertainties with it all and yeah i just want to make some change with the whole uh cannabis prescriptions and drug testing laws and all that sort of stuff so um and i think what you know personally i really appreciate what you're doing i think it's important that it gets resolved for you but also like you've said it's really important that these things get resolved for others in the future now jeremy you had your first court date recently how do you how did it go and can you give people a bit of an update on what's happening certainly so uh thomas we've commenced proceedings in the federal circuit and family court of australia and the basis of the proceedings are an app is an application under the fair work act or what's called a general protections claim where a employer has treated an employee unfairly due to a discriminatory ground so what we've said in the case is that mitchell suffers from a medical condition and the medication that he's been prescribed for that condition being medicinal cannabis and as a result of that his employer terminated him so he has been discriminated against in the workplace because of that the matter was before the judge on tuesday for initial determination the matter has been adjourned until the middle of next year and the court has ordered us to participate in alternative dispute resolution with queensland rail in the interim period we have as i've said taking this case on a pro bono basis which means that we're not charging mitchell for the case that's how strongly we feel about the issue and want to help him and help others in a similar circumstance by getting a court ruling on this issue however mitchell has to we have to on his behalf brief uh barrister or barristers and with brief senior council in relation to the matter so the equivalent of a qc or an sc who are very expensive and we also need to retain the services of expert medical witnesses to support our allegations in relation to the issue of impairment and all those things cost a lot of money so we have assisted mitchell in setting up a gofundme page to assist him in trying to get some funds to support the case not our fees but for the fees of the barrister and the expert witnesses that will be required in the case okay great that makes sense and before i before i met you talk a little bit about that jeremy can you just tell me what do you think are some of the implications for australian medicinal cannabis patients and employers if this case does go mitch's way i think rather than you the utilization of uh thc testing as an indicator it should be more of a objective assessment around impairment and whether a person would be impaired and of course that will come down to the accepted medical evidence around how long a person may be impaired after using that drug certainly the medical evidence that we have in mitchell's case is that if he took the the drug uh up to 10 hours before he started work he would definitely not be impaired by the presence of any thc levels in his system and i think there's some studies recently by sydney university where they've actually said that it could be as low as two hours um for any impairment to dissipate uh certainly the study that i've read indicates that thc levels are not an appropriate uh measure of impairment and the same thing applies to the drink driving and drug and alcohol uh laws that are currently in place in terms of random drug testing by police um there is a real issue about whether or not there's any impairment alcohol is a completely different story because impairment can be measured uh via blood alcohol levels but it's a different situation i think with medicinal cannabis and cannabis use so the implications for in employees and workers in australia generally if we get a positive outcome will mean that they can feel safe about using this drug uh and not putting their employment at risk like any other prescription medication that they may be prescribed by their doctors absolutely and and and you're 100 right a lot of the research is showing that a test for presence has no correlation to impairment so i think this is a a really important case now um mitch can you just give us a little bit of an overview on the gofundme campaign i know that there's you know if you raise enough money there's also a cause that it's going to go to tell us a little bit about about what you've set up and why it's important for you yes i've currently got a gofundme campaign up online um this is i'm looking to cover costs for a barrister and also a expert witness in court um unfortunately this uh this process costs a lot of money so i'm trying to raise some funds uh for that and um any excess proceeds would go to the cancer foundation so this isn't a get-rich-quick scheme or anything like that absolutely absolutely and can you tell us just a little bit about why the cancer foundation is important to you um i decided the cancer foundation because i uh recently um my mother passed away um from cancer and yeah so i was uh earlier in the year so i thought what more fitting of a organization than the cancer foundation because yeah all right thank you and i'm sorry to hear about your mother um i think you know to both of you before we wrap up i want to say thank you um you you guys are you know jeremy you and chamberlain's doing a lot for mitch and mitch thank you for sharing your story and and actually taking this to the next level because i think a lot of people uh will be empowered by this and will get a lot of i think it's good to know that they're not alone and you're not alone this happens frequently um before we wrap up is there anything either of you would like to to say to people watching or listening about anything really um just thanks for listening i guess thanks for uh listening to my story great and jeremy look thomas thank you for taking the time and the and assisting us in supporting mitchell uh i i just like to say that uh we really hope that we get a positive outcome in this case not just for mitchell's sake uh but for a general community in australia who are using this this drug this is going to affect a lot of people all those people have jobs or majority would have jobs and they don't want to have that concern that it could put their job at risk by taking the medicine absolutely so so just to clarify they're about a hundred thousand patients and and probably uh more than that in terms of number of approvals um but you're 100 right there there are so many people out there that are struggling with this with this issue in particular and we see that you know every week so um i do hope to have you guys back maybe we can keep people updated on how this case is going um and you know thank you again for sharing your story thank you again jeremy and chamberlains for helping mitch and everyone please do look out for the gofundme campaign we will have a link uh right now you'll see it on the screen and also we'll have one in the article so thanks again guys really appreciate you you being here and and all the best with the case thanks thomas it's been a pleasure thank you thomas

ERl9V7Y7Jxg,Changes to sponsor requirements for supplying unapproved medicinal cannabis products in Australia,2021-12-02T06:06:32Z,so i'd like to start by acknowledging the um traditional owners of the lands on which we're meeting today so here in canberra um that's the new normal people but i'd like to acknowledge that we're meeting across a large number of lands today and i'd like to acknowledge um elders um sorry pay my respects to elders past present and emerging across all of those lands and i'd like to extend that acknowledgement and respect to any aboriginal or terrorist straight island peoples that we have here today i'll start by introducing myself my name is petra bismayer i'm the director of the experimental products section here at the tga so we look after access to unapproved therapeutic goods so that includes medicines biologicals and medical devices and that's namely via the special access scheme and the authorized prescriber scheme so in today's session i'll be um talking um through your obligations as a sponsor um and help to help you understand the change the changes in sponsor requirements when supplying an unapproved medicinal cannabis product under the unapproved patient access schemes in australia so we'll be covering the removal of the tj93 declaration form uh the introduction of a new sponsor six monthly reporting form which is uh which streamlines the existing reporting obligations and how the move to sas and ap applications by active ingredient will affect you as a sponsor so i'll move through the presentation and then i'll allow some time at the end of today's presentation for questions there's some pre-submitted questions and uh that we'll we'll address and then we'll move on to the live questions so i'll start with the removal of the tj93 declaration form so as of today we've removed the requirement for sponsors to submit a declaration of conformity um with the tgo 93 for every product it's important to note that you're still required by law to ensure that your products comply with the tgo 93 however the declaration form is no longer required but as you're aware unapproved medicinal cannabis products imported into or supplied or manufactured in australia must conform with therapeutic goods um standard for medicinal cannabis that brought a number 93 which we refer to as the tj93 so this order specifies the minimum quality requirements for medicinal cannabis products and we've removed the form the requirement for the declaration form following an internal review designed to reduce regulatory burden for industry and administrative burden for prescribers and to allow tj approvals by active ingredient so it's important to note that your responsibilities to comply with tj93 haven't changed sorry i'll move the slides along might help you um so it's important to note that your responsibilities haven't changed and you remain legally responsible for your products conforming with the tj9 number 93 as well as other applicable orders including tgo 100 which is the microbiological standard for medicines and as you're aware it's an offence under the act to import export or supply therapeutic goods that do not conform with an applicable standard and breaches are subject to a range of compliance actions including civil and criminal penalties under the act under the therapeutic goods act up here i've got some guidance documents that are included on the tga website they'll provide you with additional guidance for complying with therapeutic good orders such as tj 93 and tj 100 oh i've heard notification that i can't be heard is it that i can't be heard clearly or or it can't be heard at all okay this is rachel here i've just sent out the link for those of you who may be experiencing audio issues you can um dial through if that's an alternative um you may be experiencing bandwidth issues maybe so give that a go as an alternative so you can actually see and hear through the telephone as an option thank you thanks for the feedback sounds like most most people are able to hear clearly so that's good to know um so i'll move on to ongoing targeted testing so as you're aware um um as you're aware rather than collecting tg093 forms we'll instead be diverting resources to expand our teacher 93 compliance programs so we'll be continuing our audits which include laboratory testing and this includes but it isn't limited to consistency with claims of the stated content of active ingredients as well as analysis of toxins and impurities in these medicines and we'll be doing these testing this testing on a random basis as well as targeted testing you're also reminded that your goods must comply with a therapeutic goods advertising code so that all material with information about the goods so that includes the label must be truthful balanced and not misleading and otherwise promote safe and proper use so i'll move on now to [Music] sponsor reporting obligations under regulation 47b of the therapeutic goods regulations and so we've developed a new six monthly reporting form to streamline this uh this requirement but it's important to know that this is an existing requirement so we've we've introduced a new form that will help make this reporting easier for you um so under this form um sponsors must detail the product supplied including the trade name and the quantity supplied in australia by the sponsor under each access pathway during the period to which the report relates so i've included the form itself and you can see here um that you must record the active ingredients the tray name of the product in the case of medicinal cannabis products unapproved sponsors of medicinal cannabis products must record the category of cannabinoid content and we'll cover that that next but there is a footnote here a key with um with with details of those categories the quantity that you supplied in the six month period and under which pathway you supplied that good now the reporting periods are from from january to june and from july to december inclusive and reports must be submitted within one month of the end of the reporting period and it's important to know that this isn't a new requirement um so this is an existing requirement so for um the current six-month period that we're in will end in december and you'll be required to submit reports of your usage um by the end of january these six monthly reporting forms um will be used to inform um the product um the names of products on the teacher website that i'll be taking you through later so it's important these reports are submitted in a timely fashion in order that product names can be included on the tga website so we'll as i mentioned we'll be submitting will be publishing on the tga website medicinal cannabis product details by active ingredient products uh but sorry about active ingredient categories um and the pub the idea of the publishing of this information is to support healthcare professionals in prescribing and supplying medicinal cannabis products i'll go through that in a moment but firstly i just wanted to touch on the reporting of side effects so the tga has an important role in monitoring the safety of unapproved medicines we investigate significant safety concerns as a part of ensuring product safety in the australian community and there's multiple ways in which you can in which you can report adverse events and defects and further information is available on the tta website but our preferred reporting route is via the online portal and the the link is just included here so adverse events or defects associated with the use of a medicine must be reported to the tga within 15 calendar days so i'll move on to our decision to move sas and authorized prescribed applications um away from trade name and to applications by active ingredient so these changes have been made to reduce the administrative burden for prescribers as we were finding prescribers had to reapply for new product specific tj approvals very frequently due to stock shortages and discontinuations as well as name changes as you're aware a change to the name of a product renders that product separate and distinct under the act and a new approval would be needed so the move to active prescribing by active ingredient provides prescribers with greater flexibility in what they choose to to write on their prescriptions so this will reduce administrative burden for prescribers as they'll no longer require a separate approval for their for their patient for a specific branded product if that becomes um if that's suddenly discontinued or is in shortage um so application approvals will no longer be granted for a specific product or brand however we recognize the complexity of the cannabinoid content of medicinal cannabis products and so we've decided to allow submissions on the basis of broad category of cannabinoid content and we've developed five broad categories that i'll be going through so this change essentially means that prescribers would obtain approval for a category and then issue prescriptions for any product that they like that falls within that category and that just means that they don't need to reapply to the tta for approval every time importantly the approvals will remain specific to dosage form and indication and ultimately these changes are expected to improve patient access for appropriate patients so next i'll take you through [Music] the five active ingredient categories that have been developed um and hopefully you can see that um clearly on your screen uh here but we have um we have five um medicinal cannabis categories sorry and we've framed these categories around the content of cannabidiol in the product and you can see that in the in the column there on your right so category one products um these products meet the different the the schedule for prescription only um definition as laid out in the poison standard or the susmp and for these products cannabidiol comprises 98 or more of the total cannabinoid content of the medicine and the remaining two percent um can be made up of other cannabinoids and that may include thc and importantly the uh the medicine must contain no other active ingredients um for category two medicinal cannabis products we're calling cbd dominant medicinal cannabis products and you can see here that um category 2 products are made up of between 60 and 98 cannabidiol with the remainder being made up of um of other other cannabinoids so it's important to note that we've framed the categories around the content of cannabidiol because that's the lower risk cannabinoid um so this means that um there's flexibility for um for products which are higher in which for products um which which are dominant in cannabinoid other than thc or cbd so with these next products although we've sort of named them according to thc content because we acknowledge that these that thc is likely to be the more the most dominant um second the most dominant um cannabinoid other than a kind of a dial um it does allow flexibility for products which are dominant in other cannabinoids to be captured under these categories um so category three is what we're calling balanced medicinal cannabis products and essentially they contain around 50 50 cbd and and thc in general but it could be um other cannabinoids as well um so as you can see from the definition here these products um are comprised of between 40 and 60 cannabidiol with the remaining cannabinoid content being made up of other other products which may include thc category 4 products we're calling the thc dominant medicinal cannabis products but again they could be made up of they could be dominant in other cannabinoids the key thing here is that cannabidiol makes up between 2 and 40 of the cannabinoid content and the remainder can be made up of other cannabinoids and category 5 products which we're naming thc medicinal cannabis products are made up of between two percent and zero percent um cbd um and we acknowledge that some of those may be maybe up maybe pure thc um so i hope that that clarifies the the categories i thought i'd provide an example of what a tga approval letter would look like under these changes that are effective from today so an authorized prescriber letter for example um we'll just have the category um here category 1 cbd medicinal cannabis product and for the indication refractory anxiety in adult patients assess assass product um again we'll just include the category and so doctors so doctors will become we'll gain tj approval for these um for this category but doctors can include more detail in the prescription so for example they may wish so they will need to include um details of the active ingredient um dosage form we're clinically appropriate they may wish to include the brand name but these changes simply mean that a new tj approval letter is not needed every time and this is in line with all other approved medicines for which we don't have a brand name [Music] so as i mentioned we'll also be publishing a list of medicinal cannabis products by category on the tj website and that's in recognition of the complexity of the cannabinoid content and the difficulty that prescribers and pharmacists may run into so um we'll be publishing a list of active of medicinal cannabis products by trade name according to the active ingredient categories um on the tj website um the list will is likely to go up this afternoon or tomorrow um it's currently under review to ensure um the product names are compliant with um a compliant with legislation um so there's been a delay on the uploading of those of those particular product names and we'll also be making sponsor details available to facilitate patient access okay so in terms of further support um we've updated all of our web pages um on the medicinal cannabis hub so if you're familiar with the tj webpage you'll be able to go to the medicinal cannabis hub or otherwise you can just search medicinal cannabis in in the tji website in our webpage find the medicinal cannabis hub and there's a special page for sponsors and manufacturers we've also created a number of support tools so that's the description of active ingredients the links are included here a list of medicinal cannabis products by category of active ingredient and also the authorized prescriber scheme list of medicines with an established history of use so um it may not be particularly relevant to sponsors but in the healthcare professional webinars that i've been delivering i've been going into i've been explaining the addition of category one two and three medicinal cannabis products um for specific indications um in the authorized prescriber list of medicines with an established history of use and these these particular products can be applied prescribers medical practitioners only can apply to become authorized prescribers of these particular products by category dosage form and by indication where it's included on that list without the need to obtain ethics committee approval prior to applying to the tga we've also updated our guidance documents um so that's the authorized prescriber guidance document the sas online system guidance document and the authorized prescriber online system document and we'll be making the slides from this webinar available after after the presentation finishes um so i'll move on now um there's been some some some questions um pre-submitted um prior to the webinar that i can um that we can answer um and then and and then once we're finished with those we'll be moving into um into the live questions okay so as i mentioned there was a few um there was an opportunity to submit questions um prior to the webinar um so we'll start with answering a few of those and then we'll move into the live questions okay thanks petra so we've got a question here about wholesaling has there been any changes to wholesaling of medicinal cannabis products thanks okay so no wholesaling of unapproved finished medicinal cannabis products is remains prohibited however there is scope within the regulatory framework for sponsors to enter into distribution arrangements with third parties to assist them with supplying finish finished medicinal cannabis products this means that if you're a sponsor and you import or manufacture finished products that are not entered in aitg you can only supply those products if they are held under your direct control until they're supplied under an approved pathway to an authorized prescriber or under the special access scheme approval holder sorry to the approval holder you also have to comply with certain conditions that are specified in the regulations so it's important to note that we've published updated guidance about what the direct control requirement means in practice and the reason that requirement is imposed on legislation is to make sure that the sponsor remains responsible for product control and supply decisions throughout the supply chain and this is necessary because we're dealing with unapproved therapeutic goods and the role of the tgas to manage the risks of unlawful supply uh to ensure to ensure necessary public health alerts and recalls are managed appropriately great thanks petra we've got a question about clinical trials so as a clinical trial sponsor using tj93 compliant products in our ctn what change is going what are the changes going forward when an imp so that's um [Music] investigational medicinal uh medicinal product is declared as tgo93 compliant and how do we know this great thanks akane so we're amending the ctn portal so that it no longer requests clinical trial sponsors to submit a tj93 declaration form and instead an alert will be shown requesting acknowledgement of a sponsor's legal responsibilities in ensuring that the product complies with the tj93 and all other relevant orders when an imp or an investigational medicinal product changes updating submission of the tj93 declaration associated with the ctn won't be required however sponsors are required to update the online ctn form with the new imp and to ensure that the new inp complies with tgn93 as well as all other relevant orders thanks patreon we've got a question about testing so will the tj look towards testing all australian cannabis products great thanks okay so a larger number of medicinal cannabis products will be selected for tests for laboratory for targeted laboratory testing as well as random testing and other compliance assessment activities will be undertaken as part of our teacher 93 audits so as i mentioned in the presentation this includes testing for consistency with claims of the stated content of active cannabinoid content as well as for the presence of toxins and impurities great thanks petra there's a few questions in regards to approvals prior to the current changes so will approvals granted under the current scheme prior to november 22 allow medicine substitution or will a new script or approval be required great thank you so much cannabis sas and ap approvals that were granted prior to today um will still remain valid for the duration of the um of the approval period that's specified on the approval letter but they'll be relevant only to that particular brand as has been the case until until today if the prescriber wants to to get an approval letter under the sas or ap for generic prescribing under the categories then they'll need to apply um to the tga for that approval thanks petra next question how are quality standards going to be enforced under the new requirements the sponsors of medicinal cannabis products as we've outlined in the presentation continue to be legally responsible for ensuring that their products comply with the teacher 93 and other relevant orders you're just no longer required to submit the declaration of compliance so we'll continue as i mentioned many times we'll be continuing our program of targeted laboratory testing and other compliance assessment and we'll be diverting resources from the receipt receipt and entering of the tj93 declaration forms um to the laboratories to expand our testing programs great i can see a few questions coming through about gmp so we've got a question here about what about ensuring products are manufactured under gmp and that stability studies are done to confirm shelf life great thank you so gnp requirements at present for medicinal cannabis products uh remain the same but as you be aware we held a public consultation in january of this year regarding this issue um and changes will be brought into place and they're expected to be effective from from approximately march um next year that will level the playing field um to require gmp for imported products there's also going to be another public consultation later this year to um to to outline further detail thanks petra so i've just gone to the live chat we've got a question here about tgo93 if tg093 isn't required how do we get new products not on the new cat system so doctors can apply for ap or suspi so i'm guessing this is in regards to the published list okay so in regards to the authorized prescriber established history of use list this is a list that of particular products that have been um deemed to be have established history of use in australia and haven't had any major safety concerns in the last three years and this is an internal review and sponsors can't apply to have their to have particular products um included on the on the on this list um this is purely an internal review and it's done on the basis um largely of quantity in order to reduce the burden um of sas b applications so we do routine reviews every sort of uh approximately 12 months um and we update um many products we include many products on this established history of use list and in this round of updates we've included categories one two one and two for oral oral liquids and capsules for the indications chronic pain and anxiety and category 3 products have been included for oral liquids and capsules for the indication of chronic pain and there's further information on this pathway available for prescribers on our website it's petrol i'm gonna i should hear about release of products from the sponsor how does a sponsor release product to a pharmacy without a product specific sas sorry so the question is is how does it yeah it's i guess it's in terms of how does the sponsor verify which product they're releasing and this depends i guess on the prescription that's right so the doctor will outline further detail um about what product they wish to prescribe on a prescription the changes that we're we're introducing from today simply cut regular cut administrative burden for prescribers it means that they don't have to come back to the tga every time i'm gonna tell us what brand they wish to use instead they can put that information on the prescription um including for example they may wish to prescribe um you know a cannabidiol 10 milligram per ml and thc 10 milligram per meal product and that that particular doctor may or may not wish to if they believe it's clinically suitable include details such as the the what particular brand they wish to prescribe and and a pharmacist can choose to um to you know substitute different brands provided that that's done in accordance with normal practice and where necessary with consultation with the prescriber so for example a pharmacist may wish to consult with a prescriber if a prescription is not clear um and then they they may request a new prescription but the key thing is that they won't then need to go back to the tga to issue a new approval so we've got a question here about if a doctor is an authorized prescriber under tj do they need to get new south wales authority to prescribe for a compounded product thanks um so um medicinal cannabis products may in some states and territories require additional authorization or approval as you're aware um but it's the we believe it's that you know the um the requirement to understand the the legislation in the state that they're operating up in is up to that prescriber and the tga can't comment on the particular jurisdictional requirements across the different states and territories so the prescriber is encouraged to if they have any questions um about their their legal requirements um within this their state of territory or practice to contact their relevant state or territory health department and we've got we've included contact details for those states and territories on our website when it comes to extemporaneous compounding again there's no changes at this stage but this was a question that was raised during the public consultation earlier this year and we are looking um to introduce a requirement for products which are extemporaneously compounded to require approval and a sas or ap and again these changes are likely to come in next next year great thanks petra i've got a question here about the published list on the website of medicinal cannabis products is it mandatory to complete the form for publication of product details on the tj website for unapproved medicinal cannabis products um so the form that was sent around to all sponsors is not mandatory however future updates will be done on the basis of sponsor six monthly reporting forms um and those are the report forms that are required under regulation 47b of um of our regulations and that is a mandatory requirement so sponsors must submit to us every six months the names and quantities of um products supplied and under and under which pathway um so we'll be receiving those forms and we'll be using data from um from those forms um to keep the list of products up to date we were hoping to have that list available on the on the website already but that's going to be going up later today or tomorrow we just need to review the product names to ensure that they're compliant with legislation great thanks um petra we've got a great question here about the changes and how they refl how they'll be reflected on the tga portal so will the tga portal be updated to reflect changes in relation to these new to these products uh yes so we have updated um the available options that um that prescribers can choose from in the in the sas and authorized prescriber online system so the um product specific or brand specific um trade name trade names have been removed and instead approvals um will be granted by by category um and so sub prescribers will choose um from from one of the five categories when of medicinal cannabis when they're processing their um their applications so we've got a question regarding documentation um do you does a sponsor have to have a copy of the sas b or ap approval um prior to supply yes so under uh under schedule five of our act of our regulations um sponsors must not release unapproved goods um from their direct control until those goods are subject to assass authorization or sas or ap um approval or authorization so um unapproved there's no changes to um to to these arrangements so sponsors must hold unapproved goods under their direct control until um you're satisfied that you've seen evidence of approval of the sas or authorized prescriber to release those goods thanks petra so we've got a question here about sas b and ap approval durations how long does a tga sas b approval last for for a patient under the new changes so there's no changes to the approval duration for sas fee applications and those are typically approved for 24 months however as always the the delegate has discretion to to to amend that but um typically uh 24 months um approval uh four authorized prescriber applications um under the streamlined pathway so that's um categories one two and three um for chronic pain um and for anxiety for categories one and two um no ethics committee approval is required and typically approvals will be granted for five years again there's uh that's open to delegate discretion um but typically every five years however um authorized prescribers are instead required to submit to us um their patient usage um every six months and the periods the reporting periods are the same it's for the regulation 47b um sponsor reporting um so those periods are january uh till june and july to december and uh forms must be submitted within one month of the reporting period finishing thanks patrick we've got a question here about code so do the categories have specific codes and if so what are these yes they do so the categories um and codes are included um both on the authorized prescriber application form and on the list the authorized prescriber established history of useless and this information has been made available on the tj website in all our guidance documents um and i've been outlining it for prescribers um in in our webinars um but as a as a sponsor when it comes to recording which pathway you've supplied your goods under for your six monthly reporting forms it doesn't matter whether the product has come in under the standard ap pathway authorized prescriber pathway which requires ethics committee approval or whether that um application so that that um prescription has come in under the the new the streamlined pathway um so but you will be required to differentiate whether you've supplied uh products under the authorized prescriber pathway or the sas pathway and um sponsors can can know which pathway those came under obviously on the basis of the approval letters also still getting um quite a few questions coming through regarding pharmacist substitution um generic prescribing so um so essentially um a pharmacist would um and would be empowered to do generic substitution in a as per normal um dispensing practice so the tga um and prescribing or prescriptions are come under the remit of states and territories so the tga will provide approval under category under a category of cannabinoid content and then the doctor is required to provide as much detail as they think the pharmacist needs in order to issue a prescription so for example they might they may prescribe a product which is um you know 10 milligrams per ml of thc and 12 milligrams per meal of cbd as long as that prescriber also holds an approve an approval for a category three balanced product um the tga doesn't get involved then in what particular product would be dispensed that's a matter for the pharmacist and the doctor to describe and that's no different from any other from from normal practice so if the pharmacist felt that there wasn't enough information on the script um then they would contact the doctor to ask for further information um if they if they if a particular brand was out of stock they may call they may call the prescriber and they may wish to ask for a new prescription if that was uh necessary or they may be able to they may they may um interchange that product um if it's appropriate so um when it comes to prescript uh prescribing and prescriptions um these fall into the agreement of state and territory um legislation and um pharmacists and medical practitioners requirements under their relevant boards of practice um so these are simply prescription medicines uh and they should be treated differently to other prescription medicines with the exception of the requirement for um unapproved medicines to to have a sass or ap approval in place so the question here uh another question has come through how does the sponsor know if the pharmacist switches brand well you'll know if your product has left your warehouse and you you should know under which scheme that has left the warehouse so then you'll know you'll be able to provide that information on your sponsor report um on side effects reporting both there's a question here on side effects reporting so both sponsors and prescribers have responsibilities to report side effects and so our preferred reporting route for that is via the online portal and thanks everyone for attending this afternoon if you do have any further questions if we haven't answered any questions that you had today please do email us on medicinal.cannabis at health.gov.eu and and we'll um address those questions as best we can thanks again for joining us this afternoon

lceL_cB1szQ,How Australia&#39;s most radical cannabis laws are coping two years later | ABC In-Depth,2021-12-06T09:56:46Z,growing smoking and owning small amounts of cannabis is now legal in the act but it has to be done naturally hydroponic setups can't be used the fact that we can't cultivate under lights by law is really it's quite ridiculous those handcuffs have been released and as such now i can put them up in the air as an advocate and say hey look at all the positive things about this plan hi nice to meet you this is mary's medicine a spread of handmade cannabis products she says provide life-changing treatment for her chronic depression and arthritis so we decided when the laws changed that it was time to take our power back and grow for ourselves and and produce our own medicine at a lower cost in a healthier way cannabis is decriminalized in the a.c.t but mary that's not her real name is risking a two-year jail sentence by using artificial lights to grow the drug she relies on she says it's the only way she can ensure a steady supply because it's just too hard to grow cannabis in canberra during the cooler months canberra climate is really not conducive to growing cannabis we didn't realize to begin with how difficult this climate really is that led us to actually making the decision to growing indoors under lights in a tent which is against the law and it's really tough um emotionally to know that we're breaking the law to supply our own medicine using a variety of oils creams and edibles she makes from her harvests mary says her depression is in remission and her arthritis is under control so that one's used making an extraction so it's called rso or rick simpson oil and then i've mixed that into a natural arthritis cream base for nearly two years cannabis use possession and growing has been decriminalized in the act under strict limitations territory residents can possess up to 50 grams of dried cannabis and grow two plants per person with a maximum of four per household on paper the laws clash with commonwealth ones but they haven't yet been formally tested in a court and it's still possible act police could defer to federal laws at their discretion and for some act residents like mary who the new cannabis laws don't protect anyway the rewards outweigh the risks talking about the laws in the act as well what is your assessment of where the the cannabis laws stand right now the fact that we can't cultivate under lights by law is really it's quite ridiculous i can understand that they're trying to avoid commercial productions being more easily disguised as private use yeah i think the police have enough initiative to say that's a personal use set up or that's a commercial setup why are they saying that you can only grow outdoors if it's for personal use it's it's just it seems ridiculous could you go back to treating your medical conditions without cannabis do you think to go back to those things it makes me cringe the toxicity of using those medicines is just incredible compared to using something that really has such little side effects if i had to go back to the mainstream medicines i would i would not like to think what it would do to my body long term this man who we'll call john smokes cannabis he grows under natural light to help relieve symptoms of post-traumatic stress could you talk me through how often you use cannabis and and what effect it has for you so i use cannabis daily and it has a calming calming effect for me it also helps with trauma and me dealing with past trauma i use it most mostly in that regard my mother unfortunately suffered from bipolar and she committed suicide when i was about seven or eight oh i moved around quite a lot uh my father was incarcerated uh when my mother committed suicide so unfortunately the house that i went to just after that i was sexually assaulted by family members and uh been sexually assaulted since as a grand man about six years ago [Music] he says the new cannabis laws have had a positive impact on his day-to-day life i've definitely felt like uh uplift like less of a burden on my shoulders as far as i'm a criminal and because this one plant does something good for me and those handcuffs have been released and as such now i can put them up in the air as an advocate and say hey look at all the positive things about this plan it's had a really positive impact on my life [Music] labour backbencher michael pedersen first introduced the new cannabis laws back in 2018 although the laws protect recreational users he says medicinal users should look to the commonwealth which manages the medicinal cannabis scheme for reform it is helpful on one hand that these recreational laws are assisting these people but ultimately the solution is for that commonwealth scheme to be improved so people that are taking medicinal marijuana can access it in a consistent way for some canberrans growing their own plants is maybe a pleasant recreational activity but for many people they're not gardeners and so the supply system that is set up within this regime doesn't work for them i understand those frustrations however our hands are somewhat tied here in the legislative assembly due to commonwealth legislation about supply and trafficking do you have intentions of adding the use of artificial cultivation to these laws in the future i've got no plans at this time if i do you'll be the first to know there is a review of these laws that will take place in the next couple of years i would encourage any canberran that does have a view about how these laws could be changed to get involved with that process when it takes place mr pedersen is more recently tabled a new bill calling for the decriminalization of small amounts of illicit drugs like ice and heroin which a special inquiry recently recommended should be passed into act law he says it would be a vital step away from criminal prosecution and towards harm minimisation when dealing with drug use right around the world jurisdictions both the sub-national and national level are having this debate so i think australia is very much at the start of this journey and i think it's about time we have an evidence-informed discussion about these substances so we can go about reducing the harm these substances of course [Music] are you afraid of what position your actions are taking or you know the means you're having to go to are you afraid that the position that's putting you in oh absolutely they say cannabis causes paranoia but these laws cause paranoia for me because i'm just doing my thing privately in my home treating my medic medical conditions and i'm breaking the law because of it and it it weighs really heavily on my mind [Music] you
CWIqBb24py8,Medicinal Cannabis in Australia | Azure Medical Complete Health Series,2021-11-16T23:52:28Z,good evening welcome to my first live posting i'm aparna hegde i work at azure medical as a general practitioner i'm a uwa graduate from long time i won't say how long and i've been interested and prescribing medicinal cannabis for the past five years i'd love to tell you all about you as a western australian how to access it if it's right for you and basically a little bit about the background as well and why it is so much of a topical subject these days so medicinal cannabis is only new in australia but it has been around for 50 or so years elsewhere and it has been used in a research as well as therapeutic fashion for that time the issues in the western world and particularly in australia is there's a lot of stigma associated with cannabis and in particular the word marijuana was brought in in the 50s during prohibition times to stigmatize it make it sound more mexican and therefore foreign so i like to use the word medicinal cannabis because it is essentially descriptive of what it is so the government in australia regulates two different components to the actual medicinal cannabis however being a plant-based product there's actually over 400 different compounds that include terpenes flavonoids cbg cbd and the thc which is the psychoactive or the component in cannabis that gives you the high so the government's only interested in regulating the two components which is cbd cannabidiol and tetrahydrocannabinol which is the thc the medicinal cannabis seen in australia has exploded but as yet there's only two registered products on the market uh one is a gmo produced cbd and the other is a navigable which is a thc so all the other products are not registered on the australian market and therefore there's a lot of paperwork involved to try and bring them to the patient and how that goes is cbd being a non-psychoactive part of medicinal cannabis is a schedule for medication which means that there's less paperwork to do essentially and thc being a psychoactive part has more paperwork involved and is a schedule eight substance it just means the legislation that applies to them is different so if a substance is set schedule 8 and contains thc there's an issue with taking it and driving but there'd be an issue with taking any type of psychoactive medication and driving so we wouldn't want you to for example take panadeine fort which is the codeine based medication and drive because it has problems um with making you sleepy and making you more sedated same deal with the thc part so now that i've gone through the the regulations and the paperwork what is it used for essentially cannabidiol which is cbd non-psychoactive but has a lot of therapeutic properties so it doesn't give you a high but it's used for pain relief and particularly in inflammatory conditions such as fibromyalgia osteoarthritis any type of chronic pain migraine headaches that are chronic and being non-psychoactive you can take it and drive it doesn't come up on drug testing i've had several fifo patients that take it and they've been tested while they've been on site it doesn't come up as positive at all the way the cbd works is it binds to the endocannabinoid receptors in the cells in university i was never actually taught about the endocannabinoid system but it's actually a receptor that's found in every single cell in the body and it gives you the high that you get when you exercise for example we make our own cannabinoids in the body and with that if you're depleted in some way it can lead to anxiety or low mood so cbd is quite often used to address those issues as well it's been used a lot for the behavioral issues such as attention deficit disorder and autism spectrum disorder mainly because it does alleviate a lot of that anxiety and the hyper vigilance that happens in their brains what else is it used for it's been used for reproductive disorders very strong premenstrual dysphoric symptoms pain during menstrual cycle menopause symptoms because it does have an overarching holistic wellness to it so as far as the cbd is concerned very very safe to take the only real side effects you get is if it's in an oil you can get a bit of loose bowel movements because it is an oil that the carrier is placed in might have difficulty digesting it the way the oil is taken is it's taken under the tongue and held for 30 to 60 seconds before swallowing on an empty stomach that mitigates the effect of having the loose bowel movements so the other side effect that it can have is that because it's metabolized by the liver you may get a hold up or a problem with metabolizing other medications that are metabolized through the liver so it's always worthwhile making sure that the liver functions are monitored when any type of medicinal cannabis is being used therapeutically so in terms of the cbd another use for it is the movement disorders so in children high doses have been used for seizures and to decrease the incidence of seizures in seizure disorders it's also been used in adults for degenerative conditions such as parkinson's that cause a lot of tremor or rigidity multiple sclerosis for the pain and the fatigue as well as the movement the spasticity that can be involved there as well so lots of different applications and the beauty of cbd as i said before is it's a non-psychoactive component to the medicinal cannabis very safe to take it's even been used in very high doses in children so let's talk about the more exciting and psychoactive component of medicinal cannabis which is more regulated and schedule eight the thc part the products that are available these days are range in different concentrations of thc and cbd anything that contains a more than a one percent in total component of thc is considered to be a thc medication so how does the thc work it's primarily distributed the receptors in the brain and there are receptors all through the body as well but it works in a different fashion to the cbd it still works on pain relief still works on decreasing anxiety still works on helping promote wellness however it can as i said have cognitive impact it can be sedating some sometimes we want that you know side effects because it's used for insomnia what is it primarily used for therapeutically it's primarily used for anxiety and panic attack migraines and acute onset pain chronic pain because it's a great pain medication the beauty of thc is that you don't need as the body goes and gets used to it more and more of this drug to achieve the same result which is called tachyphylaxis as you get with the opiate medications that are commonly alternatives for pain pain relief and pain medications that are more commonly used so i i really really dislike opiates and most people do in my own pain relief because i feel like it makes me sleepy but doesn't actually give me good pain relief whereas with things like the thc based medication there's a fine line obviously between getting cognitive effects and being impaired or being high and the pain relief so a dose titration is used for that but in terms of anxiety there's also an effect on decreasing anxiety and primarily that's why we use it um at night time for people who have anxiety that impairs their ability to sleep so as far as the process is concerned to get access to medicinal cannabis it's more and more open these days your gp can actually go through the system and prescribe the medication to you some are not comfortable because as with anything new you have to be familiar and gain experience with the whole process and quite frankly it is still a lot of paperwork and hassle so the access has improved there are clinics these days that are based solely on dispensing and prescribing medicinal cannabis there are gps that only do this particular field as well and the legislation in wa is such that you don't have to have anything other than the accreditation in order to prescribe it so there is a difference between an authorized prescriber as far as doctors are concerned and a non-authorised prescriber so any gp is a non-authorised prescriber and the ones that are authorized have to go through a process of being able to get the approval through the therapeutic goods administration this is tga as well as the department of health in in wa to prescribe the medications these days it's a lot easier to become an authorized prescriber so i have a question about how much the process costs the costs have actually come down a lot since the very beginning when i started prescribing about five years ago it was a lot more expensive and because there's less of a monopoly and more and more medications that are available the process has become far more simple as well as less expensive so it depends on the product in terms of the cost in general there are different ways of accessing it what what we do in azure is charge the standard console price in terms of coming in the best thing is obviously for the patient to bring all their specialist letters so that it makes the time in terms of the initial consult and follow-up far less involved and the the cost is time-based we're not about billing clinic so it's dependent on whether it's a less than 20 minutes or more than 20 minute consult the product the pharmacy will charge for a 50 ml bottle of oil about 300 and the 50 ml would probably last you for 50 days so that's pretty much how it ranges but there are now wafers oils there's even the flour that can be vaporized so the cost varies dependent on the products so in terms of the legalities behind medicinal cannabis and working on a job that does drug testing so as i mentioned before the cbd product which doesn't contain the thc is actually um safe to use and there's actually there's no psychoactive in it so it doesn't come up as positive with the drug testing for thc as far as the thc is concerned it depends on the individual and the organization that they work for if they're in a safety critical role in general the thc use would not be allowed and you know if they were in a non-safety critical role the organization would need a letter and indication for what the drug was being taken usually the occupational physician that's in charge of the organization reviews that letter asks some questions as to you know how long the person's been on it what the prognosis is how long would the person want to be taking it and what would be the downtime so with thc how long it lasts in the body and how how long it affects the body in terms of the possible cognitive effects is about six to eight hours so it works well if the person is taking it to go to sleep so the following day it's really not impairing the person it may however show up on drug testing well after the person has taken it mainly because with regular use it can go into the fat and it can come out in urine drug testing even though it may not be causing an impact on the pharmacology of the person so in terms of how you can go about getting more information so there's a number of different websites these days and i tend to basically use little green pharma which has a great range of literature and case studies as well as testimonials to direct patients to go and gain more information i also tend to use another organization that has a good website called green lab and it's a more independent not based on one particular company website and obviously when you look at worldwide literature and research canada and israel probably are the countries that have the most experience in therapeutic use of the medication and therefore have the most evidence based in australia there's a lot of studies being done ongoing a little green farmer company i've previously mentioned uh has a study that's ongoing at the moment that's collaborating with university of sydney and is subsidizing the cost of the some of their products for people that want to trial it it's a quality of life study so it's a subjective rather than an objective study and with that study the aim is to recruit 50 000 people and follow them up for at least two years and see what impact the use of medicinal cannabis has on different quality of life parameters so how can we help in terms of making it less of an issue for access in australia we can lobby our government both federal as well as local especially on the rules for driving and the use of medicinal cannabis in tasmania it's now legal to use the thc medication provided the person's been assessed and been shown not to have an impairment on their driving i had a question about the study taking on people now yes it's australia-wide and the study is still recruiting people the intent is to go to 50 000 people and they've got to around halfway so if you do want to enroll all you have to do is actually google quest and it will come up with an online questionnaire of whether you would be suitable to enroll in the quest and it will also come up with a link for different gps or practitioners that are actually involved with the quest trial and you could also go ahead and book into someone that's closest to you so in going forward as i said i would like to see all of us open our mind and use medicinal cannabis without the stigma that's associated with marijuana or an illegal substance it is perfectly legal when it's prescribed it also needs other people to come on board and destigmatize the whole issue we're not in the 1950s anymore we're far ahead of that and i believe it's not for everybody but for those that it does work for it is life changing and we need to keep an open mind we need to also encourage people to try something especially when it's something like cbd which has absolutely no cognitive effects whatsoever but a lot of potential benefits with very little side effects and risks being a plant-based product it is also something that has fewer effects and as most people say they do want to try more natural things this is definitely one of those and in destigmatizing opening it up it's treated just like another medication and if it's suitable then it's prescribed there's none of this sort of worry and weight and paperwork involved so i'd like to see a time where more people bring it on and are open to using it and it's just like another blood pressure medication if it suits you then you can go on it so i believe that's um probably where i will leave it we will hopefully get live again if there's any follow-on questions and i will answer those in the future so thanks everyone and i will finish off now

Q49AHrSpzNQ,"Sydney Addiction Seminars: Medicinal cannabis in 2021 – When, Why and How?",2021-07-30T07:06:11Z,welcome everyone to uh sydney addiction seminar for july uh 2021 um we've got a fantastic presentation lined up we have a fantastic audience um we had the most register that we've ever had tonight we have we're talking about medicinal cannabis in 2021 when why and how we have two speakers mark hardy and nickland serris two speakers to do when why and how mark is going to do when and a little bit of y and nickel and saris is going to do a little bit of why and a lot of how so mark hardy is an addiction medicine specialist and works in private practice as well and he has experience with this area and he's a member of the advisory board of ca clinics um and has a lot of hands-on experience with medicinal cannabis so i welcome mark to uh get get us going thanks very much um thank you so much for that introduction paul it's a pleasure to be here so look i've actually prepared um essentially um a large talk in the small talk but the last talks broken into two and they've all got about 14 or 15 slides in them each and i so that allows us essentially a couple of breaks through the tour for nick to to give some um perspectives on things and and then it also gives us time where if we're getting to the point where the the it's a talk soup and we want to just have an open discussion we can we can lop off you know the last third of the talk and you won't walk away without having sufficient information to to to work with so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go to my first screen and see if i can find something to to show you and then and we'll talk a little bit about about uh cannabis there um i do love technology it's so much fun isn't it does everyone like technology we're probably all in the same boat so that's me uh obviously um and that's some of my um previous uh uh occupations and preoccupations um obviously um i've been funded to do all sorts of different things um probably the biggest funder of all would have been new south wales health like it is for most of us um but along the way i've been funded to do research education and advocacy for a variety of other companies um there has been some tied research in there none of which um will affect or alter the information or the opinions that i'm going to give today um um so this one is just a a mini talk so we're talking you don't need to write all this down you don't need to write anything down but this is just sort of like a glazed over summary of some of the stuff that i want to talk about initially because i think it's most directly relatable to addiction medicine specialists and it's also something upon which i based a talk that i gave at the australian new zealand conference in addiction over the internet um by via tele tele-visual techniques about two months ago so i mean look the basic tenet of this slide is that we've had cannabis since the stone age um and it's been found you know 10 000 years ago um and some of the names that we've got for cannabis today such as ganja are actually from very old words in in ancient languages and there's a nice picture of something very very old for you to look at that's telerad in the kingdom of judea or what's left of it and it's been written about as well and it's been used basically either as an incense type of product or even as an inhaled or edible product um in in the iron age and and later on in ancient greece um as well it was depicted in that picture down below in botanical art in the byzantine era and um hashish was described in islam cultures in the middle ages um it's interesting um um the hashitians were actually the basis upon which the word assassin came about because um people would would uh trade in hashish and um if you you wanted to not i've tried everything yeah yeah thanks if you wanted to knock someone off you just um get a couple of ounces of the of the of hashish and um and away you'd go you know someone would sneak up behind the the intended target and knock them on the head for you now it's also been interesting to look at sort of modern history um we go through cannabis being used by napoleon's troops when they invaded egypt where they couldn't get alcohol even though um even though they wanted it because the egyptians didn't drink um if we look at some of the psychological effects of of cannabis they were described in the 1830s and 1840s by doctors and in fact it's also found its way into various wonderful um pieces of literature if we go to um the the first legislation around prohibition uh we we're looking at the early 20th century uh with the international convention on opium in the hague and then finally the marijuana tax in the usa which eventually led to its um its prohibition now interesting as that all is um it's it's it's it's relevant to think for a moment what were the sorts of things people use cannabis for apart from getting stoned um all of that time and there has been lots of interesting data and lots of interesting research done in this um people do hold phds on on you know the history and philosophy of various aspects of medicine and and cannabis is no different and what they've come up with over time is is things like inflammatory diseases depression amenorrhea arthritis loss of appetite and asthma and at least three of those uh the sorts of things that we're looking at when we when we look at medicinal cannabis today if we if we look at sort of modern self medication i mean um i wrote this before i even knew nick was going to be one of our commentators tonight um and so um hats off to nick he um he did some really interesting work with his colleagues um in the camp study um and he did he did a couple of them and i think there's one more coming which i'm sure nick will want to talk about um uh when when he gets gets a chance to talk um it's interesting what's what's come out of this is people will spend about 68 a week on on on cannabis at that time and about six sevenths of it i suppose was inhaled and the main reasons not that dissimilar to some of the things that we saw you know in ancient times anxiety chronic pain depression sleep problems now in the camp study there was a high level of of side effects which i've listed there um and there were a couple of issues that really came out of this and the first is that about a sixth of people at the time at dsm criteria for moderate to severe cannabis use disorder uh that that needs to be pointed out that people when they when they self reported using cannabis as in a medicinal context they they uh they certainly didn't just go and do it by halves they said they got stuck into it and about about 17 and a half percent of them reported um sufficient use of sufficient criteria to meet a use disorder and of course there was there was the other concerns that came out this is the really good stuff about the qualitative nature of this research is that it also pointed out that you know people felt that they that it should be more mainstream that the illicit sourcing was problematic um and that was obviously going to just criminalize their medicalized problems um and that there was an issue with consistency and quality which we find is something that certainly is different about medicinal cannabis when it's provided by cannabis uh growers and pharmaceutical companies that um deal in the business of manufacturing and selling prop medicinal cannabis products of course i got interested in this because of this slide and that that was a bit of work that came out of the late 2000s before 2010 and it's referenced from the mja and it was about the same time that this work was being done that i was fortunate enough to be working um at langton center with um james bell and and then subsequently nick and we were looking at educational materials for addiction medicine specialists and we embarked on on a fairly ambitious project to do one on pharmaceutical opioid misuse and one of the nice things about the roxbury paper is that what it showed is the start of 99 2000 is somewhere around about three quarters of hospital separations from opioid poisoning were due to heroin and only about a quarter were due or sorry one fifth sorry were due to to to uh pharmaceuticals but by the end of the decade the the polls are almost completely flipped on that and about three quarters of of opioid poisonings were due to pharmaceuticals and only about a quarter of them were due to elicit opioids and where did this all come from well it came from prescription pads and it came from pharmacy comforts and it came from you know people giving their kids um opioids uh for their pain and and and sometimes people selling their opioids to other people um to earn a living and and and this is a big problem because we have an aging population and so this is just one of the issues around opioid prescribing that's being currently mopped up by the various different things that have been happening um over the last three or four years in in medicine in australia we're seeing pbsd funding of opioids we're seeing tga change guidelines for the use of opioids chronic non-cancer pain we've seen a virtual shift of the poles of of pain specialists from 20 years ago where opioids were promoted to get ahead of the pain to now where people have been described opioids um and essentially being taken off them but what this leaves of course is a large gap of people in the middle who are either now sourcing opioids through various uh ways they might never have thought they'd do previously sometimes illicitly or having to put up with pain and finding that they don't have any ready remedy for this and further to what i just said it's not like the opioid deaths have backed off as a consequence of um of defunding this was just as the defunding was happening but certainly long after deep describing of opioids had already um undertaken and opioids were still of the of the of the main this is of all illicit drugs and how people died 37 of them were due to opioids um of course you know people didn't just have an opioid in their system when they died and they will most likely have been more likely to die if they had multiple depressant substances in their body at the same time so this of course is in some ways a bit of a mashup of a slide but this has come from the australian institute of health and welfare and this is how they've broken it down and of course one of the most worrying trends about it was the synthetic opioids things like tramadol fentanyl were tending to increase it's interesting um people don't tend to feel the same drug liking i suppose for drugs like tramadol and pentadol they might do for drugs like like oxycodone morphine or heroin however it must be said that they that they all have a tendency to cause dependence and just because to pentadol um has a reported 129th the uh opioid equivalence according to um official papers of of morphine doesn't mean that you can't get hooked on it um i've seen people turn up on you know a thousand fifteen hundred milligrams of dependable um and they they struggle to get off it now i know this is not directly relatable yet to medicinal cannabis but it does come bring us back to what happens as an addiction medicine specialist when you see someone on opioids or you see someone in pain quite often they're forgotten that that they may be shooting for something that's impossible most of the patients that i see who've come in with very unrealistic goals about pain will come out with unrealistic answers unfortunately so we aim for about a 30 or better improvement in pain with improved functional capacity there's no point in taking pain away if you're stiff as a board lying on the couch with the remote control just watching netflix all day but if you can actually contribute some meaningful way to a lifestyle or have a have a quality of life then the pain reduction is worth worth having a go for we obviously want to minimize adverse effects some cannabinoids do that others others obviously have as we heard in the cam study can have some side effects some considerable side effects in fact um we want to control aberrant behaviors and we still want to do that whether we're going to use opioids or we're going to use cannabinoids and one of the things about chronic pain treatment which was poorly understood probably 30 years ago but is all too well understood now is is hyperalgesia opioids cause hyperalgesia so people tend to escalate the doses and then find themselves in more pain and then they run the risk of overdose and one of the nice things about using a medicinal cannabinoid is is that it's extremely difficult to overdose on on a on a cannabinoid product and there are lots of um i guess uh physical and psychological um uh warning shots fired in the air that will give you plenty of time to to back off on using a cannabinoid or to use a different type of cannabinoid for that matter now of course medicinal cannabis has thrown up questions that we might not have thought of um you know 10 years ago 20 years ago and the who stepladder is an absolute classic because if we look at it anything above step one really involves opioids and yet if we if we're going to live in a society that's going to defund um describe and and deter doctors from prescribing or using opioids then then the who step ladders out the window or at least parts of it that contain opioids are and it leads us to think well where do we fit something like a cannabinoid in um should it be at step three or step four or could we even think about putting it in at step two in fact if we look at canada they've introduced guidelines recently that suggested as a second line treatment um we're not there yet um and and nor are our guidelines um nor am i challenging our guidelines by bringing that up and simply raising a question for us to consider that potentially we're using cannabinoids as a last resort treatment and if we see less than perfect results in patients who are using cannabinoids for chronic pain is because most of the time by by the time they get to a prescriber um they've had multiple interventions which may include things like very young spinal injections or epidural injections spinal cord stimulators they've tried half a dozen opioids they've tried anti-neuropathic drugs most of the patients who i see with chronic pain who want medicinal cannabis i'm not 25 year olds trying to legitimize cannabis use disorder although i do see them too um but the average age is about 55 sort of late gen x coming into baby boomers who want to maintain a quality of life so the question is where should they sit in terms of of the who step ladder and the answer is it's extremely difficult to to reconcile the the ladder with treatment today with things like cannabinoids or tms or or deep brain stimulation um so if we look at just briefly the sorts of there are two main products in a cannabis plant that are currently utilized and i'm going to talk about phytocannabinoids primarily i think nick can talk a lot about some of the interesting synthetic stuff which i think um you know we haven't really got too much in australia yet but there's been a lot of research overseas on synthetic cannabinoids um but the the phytocannabinoids um there's really two active ingredients that are used um the first one is cannabidiol which is abbreviated to cbd um it's it's fairly low impact to be honest it's not addictive it's not psychoactive a recent study demonstrating not no significant impact on driving it tends to work more through pathways of inflammation it does have some gaba effects um it's anti-inflammatory and analgesic certainly i see improved pain coping and anxiety and it's usually helpful with sleep doses i've written doses there 25 to 100 milligram bd they're probably really starting doses i've seen people who need considerably higher doses to get anywhere and one thing about cbd is that if you use the sorts of doses that are being tossed around now as the s3 indication of 150 milligrams per day um you're going to have a lot of i guess people who are going to slip through the cracks who can actually try this and think well medicinal cannabis is useless because 150 milligrams a day isn't a lot for pain and inflammation people may need 300 400 500 milligrams a day at the moment in australia that is a very expensive enterprise if you're using 300 milligrams a day traditionally most tga applications for cbd are around about 300 milligrams per day you have to then go back to the tga and get an approval to go higher in doses but it's not uncommon to to to have to go back if you want to just use cbd um to to find yourself asking the tga for five or six hundred milligrams of cbd per day now i'm i've left out some of the indications here about about epilepsy and we can come back around to them a little bit later um but it's it's interesting the doses for epilepsy uh sky high if you if you've got a treatment resistant epileptic the doses that you would need to use are almost financially untenable and even the calculations in america when using cbd of about 32 000 a day and not unrealistic and if we were to treat epileptics in australia it would be very easy to rack up almost the same bill uh if you were just going to use cbd for for treatment resistant epilepsy so that's the cbd stuff and quite often it's a starting point for people with chronic pain um but it's it's not it's not where all of my patients will end up and usually when i talk to patients if i was having a consultation over the internet now with someone in the audience i'd be saying we'll start with cbd if you want to preserve your driving um it has some anti-inflammatory properties it has some analgesic properties it'll probably help pain coping and sleep a bit it may help you feel less anxious about your pain about two-thirds of my patients might feel better on cbd but a third of my patients will either want an increase in dose or they'll want something stronger and that's where delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol comes in so thc of course is the psychoactive component of of medicinal cannabis and it is the the thing that gets people stoned we tend to use very very low doses in in medicinal contexts probably about 120 of that which you'd smoke in it in a joint um there is some synergy between cbd and thc and people write you know legions of research papers on what they call the entourage effect which is the combination of different cannabinoids together that they that they actually equal more than the sum of their parts so the doses we would use with tetrahydrocannabinol usually around five to twenty milligrams two to three times a day and it's quite common to use um combination products in fact um more and more the longer i work in the cannabis field the less i i if i can if i have someone with significant pain which is sleep interfering and this pain scores quite high and they've got um they've got that history of trialling things like interventional pain techniques and high doses of opioids it would be unusual that i wouldn't want to try them on a combination product first but and whilst that needs to be leveraged against the the likelihood of impacting on driving um and we can come back to in the q a about how long people have to be off of cannabis before they can drive um whilst whilst i'll have to have that conversation with people about driving that they can't drive while they're actively using a thc product because it's still illegal even though it's medicinal that if they wash it out they can go back to driving and sometimes people will say well i'll have a combination product or i'll have a thc product um and then if i'm going to drive i'll i'll wash out the thc and i'll try and use some cbd or i'll go back on my traditional meds then the other thing is that the cbd is quite expensive so cbd for a 30 ml bottle of 100 milligram per ml so that's 3 000 milligrams of cbd um in a bottle will cost around about 200 plus postage or 200 plus dispense fees and that would be probably one of the cheaper manufactured ones there are compounders out there who are doing it cheaper and there are some illicit cannabinoid um purveyors um in you know northern new south wales who can do it cheaper the purity of that is probably questionable but it is an expensive enterprise to use cbd thc of course is in abundance in cannabis plants and quite often when people are trying to purify cbd they're having to pay for assays having to pay for purity tests having to make sure that it is something people could drive on um but the goal posts are incredibly generous when it comes to thc so as people transition from cbd to thc products the price has dropped considerably the price of a thc containing product of say a 20 milligram per mil product 100 mils of thc with um with maybe one or less milligram of cbd and it is only about 250 dollars and so there we've got about 100 hundreds of 10 000 milligrams of thc for 250 dollars whereas on the other side of the coin you had 3 000 milligrams of cbd pure for about 200 220 dollars and so there is a you know a cost or a health economics argument to be had with patients if you're going to be using thc or cbd products or some combination of the two and certainly it is as cheap as chips to use thc and it is highly effective against pain um so long as one's mindful of the potential psychoactive effects and once taken a pretty good drug and alcohol history and done a risk assessment and a mental health history of course you'd be worried about using anything with thc with anyone who had unstable mental health issues uh you'd uh you would meet considerable resistance from anyone including myself if they were if they had a history of psychosis particularly psychosis on a cannabis plant um you just can't go down that road with thc with people with the past history of psychosis but it's interesting how many people i see who who've had significant diagnosis made by psychiatrists over the years some war veterans for instance who have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and in fact they're smoking three grams a day and their mood never changes from conversational conversation so again you've got to be thinking about the diagnosis that's been made in some cases by some people there is potential actually that that not everyone who's had a history of psychosis has actually had a psychosis so you need to go back and do your homework about that if someone's asking for a thc product with that sort of history you probably need to do a little bit of research get some collateral history and work out where they've come from uh before striking it out completely but certainly wouldn't dive in you know where angels fear to tread and look this is going to be the the last side of i think our the first little bit and then we can stop for some conversation from nick but i just wanted to really go through the the processes um so there's a portal on the tgi i was going to get a video of this but um um having looked at what we have in terms of technology tonight and and the fact that it could just take up a lot of time there are lots of videos on the internet and and the tgi i've got videos on this you just get a portal you go on the tgi there's a portal there that you get all sas speeds through i mean if we look at long acting injectable um buprenorphine and the story there they had the portal was available for that you look at other drugs if you need to use the sass speed portal oncologists are very familiar with using sass b portals for their drugs you set it up with the username which is usually your email address you get a password and then it'll take you through a series of about five or six pages where you can use your clinical justification for using medicinal cannabis uh you could you can check box and new south wales health authority or state authorities usually say state authority but in new south wales of course we would use new south wales health so you can get an au number if someone's got a past history of addiction or past history of cannabis use disorder um remember it doesn't necessarily mean that they can't have it it just means that you need to think about they're going to be tolerant and they're probably not going to want to start on 10 milligrams of cbd a day and that's probably not going to be very helpful and it may actually disengage them from treatment um so you you might be thinking we'd need to use a thc containing product because it's an s8 then you'll need to check box to state approval um it can take up to a week to get that but usually we get turnarounds on the on on the tga same day but i usually tell people it'll be two to seven days um we we do the scripts in real time for our patients and i think that's been my practice it's not everyone's practice some people wait till they get it back but i've because i've got a team behind me that do a lot of the work for me i'll write the script and we'll write on the tga approval number on the top of the script once we get it back within you know 24 48 hours up to seven days when when they're working overtime from there we we see the monthly for the first three months and then after that you know we will see them about every three months unless there's a change in the product that they want to use now it's important to think about the costs of of cannabis and this is part of the informed consent um uh argument that you have to have in in in any um treatment paradigm that this is going to cost money and it's not going to be rebateable and i don't think if we look at um governments and policies they've sort of sidestepped the entire pbs argument for medicinal cannabis they've gone for one product for childhood epilepsy there's one product which is a combination oral mucosal spray i'm doing my best not to mention brands but we all know what they are the average cost for using some of the ssb approval type drugs averaged out to be between 200 to 400 a month so if you're on a thc style of product you might be able to get away with spending 200 to 250 dollars a month if you're using a predominantly cbd based product i'd be thinking more 400 to 500 a month the sorts of side effects of cbd i'd be looking at things like drowsiness dry mouth a little bit of dizziness orthostatic hypotension they tend to be transient um and people get used to it so they may feel a bit drowsy in the daytime if they're taking it in a bd or tds strategy but they still get good benefits from sleep at night and they're not sort of falling asleep at the wheel during the day after a few days um clearly the side effect profile with thc goes up um and you know they can include the side effects of hallucinations and intoxication they can paranoia or level of consciousness um and of course dependence um now it's quite common for patients to come and see me after they've spoken to a pain specialist and and they they've been told they can't use it outside of a clinical trial or that they can't use it because it's illegal or they can't use it because they're gonna get hooked on it it's a difficult conversation to have because particularly coming from certain craft groups where where opioids have been such a mainstay of treatment and in fact i can't think of a gaba drug that probably doesn't cause a dependent syndrome either when i first started going to international conferences as a staff specialist one of the first posters i stopped at this in 2012 was on the abuse potential of um gabapentin and um and analogues such as pregabalin that was that was nine years ago um and and so these are drugs that we commonly use and commonly prescribed and i don't see that the the dependence of those drugs is any any less worrisome than the dependents for thc a recent study in canada looking at only six months and i think that's a weakness of the study showed that although people generally derive increasing benefits over the six-month period of time on a thc product that was as a 25 milligram based product of thc the doses didn't change appreciably over that time so we didn't see this sort of accumulation of doses or this this um this uh notion of hyperalgesia coming in so the people were sort of caught in the crossfire of tolerance and and higher algesia and not knowing which way to go with the dose we need to always when we we're doing when we're talking to patients we need to remind them that it's illegal to drive with thc in your system um that it can show up in in urine drug screens long after it it shows up in the saliva test so the saliva tests um it'll be out of your saliva somewhere between 6 and 60 hours um there's some good literature on that um generally speaking if people are taking cbd dominant with a small amount of thc products i i've started asking them to go and think about buying you know street drug test kits from the local chemist and testing themselves after 12 hours 24 hours 36 hours the official line for most cannabis prescribers is somewhere between three and five days before you can drive it it is a long time um 72 hours is three days even the most seasoned cannabis user will probably have it out of their system by 70 hours the question of course arises if you have an accident and you get sent off to hospital after you've hurt someone and it shows up in your urine this is still largely untested legal ground in terms of whether or not people will face um you know criminal or civil penalties if they've got cannabis in their urine but they actually stopped using their medicinal cannabis product three weeks ago um it's always going to be a hard one that one but the owners will be on the on on the prosecution not on the defense in that situation to demonstrate um that uh that they the cannabis had affected capacity so generally speaking of course we want to try and manage a sort of a balance if you like between benefits and side effects and costs involved i think that's nearly the the end of the first part but i'll just i'll just go on to this slide and and just talk briefly about some of the challenges that we're we're looking at in the future obviously depending on dose control we want to make sure we engage patients so the start load go slow process is really good and it's quite important particularly with thc um but if we're using the wrong product for the wrong treatment if we're just giving people low dose cbd for profound problems with their with chronic pain we may find that we don't engage patients at all we do want to reduce pain but we also want to manage expectations we want to make sure that people feel like their their treatment is helping them but we also need to show them that there are limits to treatment and if they're going to stay on low-dose cbd because it's too expensive then they may be actually you know better spending their time and money doing something else and we also need to understand that there's going to be some variations between patients so i've got big hulking former rugby league players who are six foot four and 115 kilos who are on 20 milligrams of cbd twice a day i think it's wonderful and i've had 94 year old bed-bound people with severe arthritis up and down their spine every every weight-bearing joint in their body who find 300 milligrams of cbd useless and need a thc cbd combination um with someone of that age of course you've got a balance falls risk you've got to balance renal function you've got to think about just how much treatment is too much treatment but if they're in care and if they're supervised then obviously thc can be very helpful for them the other challenges around research evidence there have been a lot of rcts and systematic reviews written overseas when we talk about the evidence of acceptability of of cannabis treatments for chronic pain um it hits the moderate level there's really only four levels you know there's good uh moderate um you know sub-optimal and terrible and and moderate is actually the second best tier um so that's often forgotten uh in arguments for and against the use of medicinal cannabis um and of course one of the issues that i strike and i'm you know partly responsible for is being involved in studies that are largely you know observational you know they're not really the best quality studies for us to be able to tell whether or not we're really making a difference or whether we we just think we are of course we've got every time i see an insurance case there's refuting position statements by pain specialists in the rac gp and even the racp and patients then don't get access to medicinal cannabis treatments for workers compensation cases they have to pay for this themselves and i'd like to see some sort of you know common thread or common thought across the medical specialties to see if we could do research together uh to to to come to a common ground about this whether or not we find the evidence is successful or not because if it isn't successful then we all need to know that we all need to stop doing it you know it's that's the scientist in us we can't just say oh i think it's good so let's all get together and make it good no we need to know if it's good but we need everyone basically trying to work in the same direction to see whether or not there is sufficient evidence to fund treatment both with with workers compensation or with third party or you know various other state insurance bodies as well as potentially the pbs all right so that was the end of the first part of the talk i'm going to stop sharing the screen now and just hand it back to paul if or hand it through to nick but i'll mute now and see if someone else wants to to dive in nick did you want to make any comments now i think you have to unmute yourself i'm muting um yes probably worthwhile maybe if i can perhaps provide a little bit of context because when we're talking about the role of medicinal cannabis in the treatment of substance use disorders um and i think uh much of what what mark has presented is sort of is related to some of the more common conditions in which we think about using medicinal cannabis such as pain and we know there's so much overlap in our patient populations that there's so much comorbidity i think many of our patients be they prescribed opioids or whether or not they're using cannabis products or other substance use alcohol chronic pain is actually quite prevalent in that in in many of the people that present for iod treatment so i think one of the things we need to ask ourselves is there are old medicinal cannabis in the treatment of comorbidities such as pain and there we can draw upon existing evidence and experience and sort of make an assessment there whether or not you know can we use medicinal cannabis for treat to treat ptsd or chronic pain or the mood of you know move other conditions that people are promoting cannabis products for but i think if we also then from for sort of an iod population community one of the questions we have to ask ourselves where do we see the role of medicinal cannabis um in in our patient populations and i think it's probably worthwhile sort of identifying that i think there's sort of three areas that we need to be alert to the first area is that i think that there are many patients who are going to be prescribed medicinal cannabis and in particular a thc based product who do not necessarily have an aod background or a substance use disorder history and that we have to appreciate that a proportion of patients prescribed thc long term will develop a cannabis use disorder our estimates and some of the work that we've been doing puts that at around 10 to 20 percent of patients prescribed a thc product long term will develop features of a cannabis use disorder that's not dissimilar to the proportion of patients prescribed opiates that develop an opiate use disorder it's the comparable proportion of patients like benzodiazepines about 10 to 20 percent develop a benzodiazepine disorder so i think that's one of the things as a an addiction sort of community we need to be prepared that there will be patients that medicinal cannabis itself is associated with a cannabis use disorder so that's one thing for us to sort of think about in the same way we're often asked to pick up the pieces when we have chronic pain patients with opiates that become dependent and then they end up in our treatment system for their dependence so i think we need to be prepared as a sector increasingly as we see more medicinal cannabis being prescribed that there will be a population of patients who develop some form of cancer's use disorder so that's one group mark touched upon the issue of opioids and the potential opioid sparing effects of cannabis and this is one of the rationales that many people have been promoting medicinal cannabis that opioids are so harmful so widely used associated with so many horrible harms such as you know addiction and overdose and all those issues and that many advocates have been arguing well cannabis is produces good effects good outcomes patient outcomes and it's not associated with the risks associated with opioids the evidence for that is still very much yet to be determined there are lots of survey studies and we've done some of those ourselves where you ask patients since using your medicinal cannabis what's happened to your opiate dose and quite high proportions of patients say i've reduced my opiate dose because of my medicinal cannabis the research studies though the evidence for this in terms of clinical trials and even animal studies actually is still somewhat somewhat unclear so a systematic review that uh susie nielsen was the lead author a number of of us were co-authors on uh looked at this issue in some details published i think in 2019 and basically at this point in time um it's still premature for us to say with confidence that cannabinoids are associated with opioid sparing the area the the strongest evidence is actually epidemiological and in particular you look at the jurisdictions in the u.s where there is widespread availability of medicinal cannabis compare it to the states where there isn't similar availability of medicinal cannabis and they've gone and looked at a whole range of population opioid harms such as overdose rates and so forth and they've generally been able to demonstrate lower population harms where medicinal cannabis is more widely available but as we all know epidemiological data is potentially you know it's affected by lots of uh other confounders that we can't always control for or in our statistical methods so there may well be a role for opioid sparing with the with cannabinoids but at this point in time nick the evidence is not strong nick would you mind if i cut in and ask you a question as a specialist in addiction medicine seasoned researcher etc etc what sort of conditions would you think you might be interested in prescribing a medicinal cannabinoid to treat so i'm an addiction medicine specialist so i won't treat chronic pain i won't treat ptsd i don't treat epilepsy because they're not my fields of expertise i feel confident treating substance use disorder in patients so in particular then and this is the third big area which i think is an important one for us to understand is also what is the role of medicinal cannabinoids in treating substance use disorders and very quickly with alcohol there's a lot of interest and a lot of promise around the role of cbd cannabidiol and paul and i have been trying to get a study up now for three years three years and so there's a lot of interest about cbd for alcohol withdrawal management but also as a relapse prevention medication but to date all we've got is some animal data we don't have good human data yet the other area is can we treat opioid use disorder with cannabinoids so there's some good animal data um about cannabinoids can ameliorate opiate withdrawal and there's even some emerging human studies where cannabinoids can dampen the severity of opiate withdrawal but we have no studies looking at longer term um you know cannabinoids as a relapse prevention you know for long-term abstinence from from opioids so at this point in time there may be a role for thc based medicines to assist with opiate withdrawal and if we talk to our patients many patients describe you know how in train spotting you know the it's get some cans of chicken soup and lock yourself up um you know in a room and with some with some fluids so often we talk to patients we can often actually learn a lot from our patients what do you find useful and many patients for many years have been saying well cannabis helps with me coming off methadone or in my opi withdrawal so there may well be a role but we still don't have good studies there's a lot of interest and excitement around the role of cbd for stimulant use some really good animal data was coming through cocaine in particular and for methamphetamines less so but starting to happen we've just had a big cbd randomized control trial has just been published looking at cbd versus placebo for cocaine treatment cocaine dependence and they found that cbd was not effective at all compared to placebo in either reducing cocaine use nor introducing cravings for cocaine so i think we'd have to put the stimulant use on hold until we get some better evidence and then the big obvious area is cannabis use disorder so can we use cannabinoids to treat cannabis dependence um and today the evidence most of the evidence is in the role of nabiximols so that's the thccbd combination um we've done most of that research here in new south wales um both looking at the big smiles for cannabis withdrawal effective compared to the sipo and then the big randomized control trial that we published two years ago now was looking at sativex or nabix miles versus placebo in combination with uh counselling cbt over 12-week period we found that the big smiles aren't used used less illicit cannabis during the course of treatment but most importantly after 12 weeks of treatment within the big smiles and counselling we then stopped the um nabiximol so we discontinued it after 12 weeks we followed people like 12 weeks later and we actually found that that um that the rates of of cannabis so that the reduced cannabis use persisted three months later so these patients did not all relapse back to cannabis use once we stop the nabixomoles now that's what we see with nrt you know nrt for 12 weeks stop it and then most people don't relapse but with methadone you use methadone for 12 weeks stop it and everyone relapses so it's made us think that the biximals may be more an nrt model than uh than a methadone model and then the other exciting area is cbd but all we've got is one pilot study positive and we're trying to get a randomised controlled trial up through an hmrc at the moment so nick you're in active clinical practice and whilst you're a very keen and effective researcher you are obviously seeing patients day by day that are not not eligible for clinical trials so what do you think the uh the reasonable addiction specialist in the street inverted commerce should be doing you know tomorrow morning with your next patient uh with a cannabis use disorder so i think we're in this challenging situation um in australia where most of the cannabinoid products we can prescribe they're not licensed tga products so they're they're so they're available through special access schemes and marks describe the process and that now is a much smoother process than it used to be so you can access those products through special access scheme now if you work in a local health district such as i do in order to prescribe a medication you have to have it on your formulary to get onto your formulary it's almost impossible to get one of these medicinal cannabis products not licensed products onto a hospital formulary we've tried without success so in my public sector role i actually can't prescribe any medicinal cannabinoids um outside of a clinical trial because my lhd won't let me the big smiles is a licensed pharmaceutical product that is actually is is as mark pointed out quite expensive to use it um to treat cannabis use disorder we figured out it works out at around it works at around two to three hundred dollars a week if you're paying over the counter prices from the big smalls and that is actually many of my patients say that's more expensive than what i spend on cannabis you know if you're going through you know half an ounce a week that's 150 to 200 and then the big smile is going to cost you more so there's challenges in the public system if you work in the private system though you can do obviously the world is your oyster and in the private system yes i think it is possible and uh can i do a plug now i started doing private practice and uh medicinal cannabis is one of the areas that i'm most interested in again you know and been you know talking to mark a lot and getting mark's experience in this about how to be prescribing medicinal cannabis i think there's the role both for thc based products and cbd products in the treatment of cannabis use disorder i think there's uh you know i think what you do is you need to go heavy with the thc early on um as you know because otherwise patients will get their their thc withdrawal their cannabis withdrawal and that will lead to relapse so i think early on you hit them hard with the thc and then know the time the thc can wane off and that's when you increase your cbd proportions nick thank you very much and can i remind the audience to please use the type in the chat or or use the reactions button to put your hand up but with 108 people logged in i can't necessarily see all the hands because i've got seven screens worth of people so please it's probably best if you use the chat to ask your to type in your questions so nick and i are just one other really important point the one population that we see a lot of um in working in aod are people in opioid treatment methadone buprenorphine programs anyone who's worked in that in that setting will be familiar with the the just how widespread cannabis use is in is in our otp clients um all the estimates suggested somewhere around 40 of of otp patients use cannabis fairly regularly now historically we've always dismissed those patients as are they're just addicted they're just drug users that's just what they do however when we started looking at why does the general population in australia use you know medical cannabis and the common reasons are things such as ptsd pain sleep problems and effective problems mood disorders anxiety and depression so that's what the main population is saying that's why they use medical cannabis and then we look at otp populations i mean look at what are the common comorbidities pain depression anxiety ptsd sleep problems so that's actually got some of us thinking well to what extent are these people just addicted to cannabis and that's why they use drugs because they're just you know dependent or is this actually a self-medication so these patients effectively self-medicating their pain their anxiety and sleep uh by using cannabis because you know if they use benzos they lose their take away so they use opioids they lose their takeaway so cannabis actually may well be an effective and sort of you know more acceptable medication so we've actually got a phd student who's exploring these issues and looking at you know why do our methadone patients use so much cannabis because that's the other thing when you look at all the outcome studies with methanol and buprenorphine all substance use reduces over time alcohol amphetamines cocaine heroin everything reduces the longer patients stay in treatment with one exception and that is cannabis and cannabis use stays static over time so i think we need to sort of look at this issue of cannabis use in our otp populations and just just sort of think about what's going on there a little bit more i think that there is going to be a significant role for us thinking about medicinal cannabis in otp populations certainly really awesome so you go paul yeah oh no in fact i was going to ask mark if you had any comments or if you had wanted to go to part two of your presentation look we could almost go to questions but i'll probably put a little bit more up on processes um the the the thing that nick was saying is certainly exactly what i've seen too in all the otp prescribing years that i've had it's incredibly common to see cannabis come up in people's urines if you're testing for it um and and it's usually because people find that it helps them sleep and it regulates their mood and that's the most common reason why my patients would consider using a cannabinoid while they're on an otp program and i think the other point that nick made about about people not wanting to stop um we haven't quite got to the stage yet with my private patients um with the ones that i work at through through the clinic that i that i operate out of um we do a lot of research there by the way and we we publish research and we're looking to publish outcomes in in all different directions and one of the ones that i'd like to look at is well how many of my patients identified as as substance abuse disorder or cannabis use disorder from the get-go and and my my guesstimate so far is that it's around about the same figures that we saw in the cam study that it's around about 15 to 20 percent of patients have us have have a cannabis use disorder from the get-go and and a lot of them don't want to come off medicinal cannabis you know as nick was saying that they wanted that those numbers stay static if they come on and they've got an anxiety disorder or a sleep disorder one of these comorbidities that um facilitates a sass b application um then um and we put them on a medicinal cannabinoid and they come off as they usually do they're illicit cannabinoid then what we find is that they want to just stay on cannabis as as nick said those numbers do tend to remain fairly static a few people will come off but most of them will stay on now look i have got some more slides but i'll i'm trying to temper the slides versus time we've got a little bit of time left i might just see if i can jump to um [Music] another one if i've got it seems to have fallen off my page which is a really good thing i know sorry guys it didn't fall off the page i found it um i'll um see if i can go back up to the top so it's interesting we talk about addiction actually um it's not a bad slide to start on um but i'll i'll see if i can get to that really quickly and i'll start at slide one and then we'll get down to there if i can um start from the beginning there we go sorry pressing the same button over and over again and getting the same result um the thing is we don't have to go through some of these slides already so we started out with about five or six indications um and they were in the original guidelines and everyone who's here tonight probably understands them really well um um but they that this is probably worth pointing out that the tga actually has no indications there are no indications so there's only an indication an indication happens when a drug company registers a drug for a reason and none of these unlicensed products have been registered for any indication so there are a number of areas that that that the tga have reviewed the evidence for but the tga also really clear they will consider an application for anything um you know if you want to prescribe thc to qr writer's block you can do that i mean they won't accept it but it's not as though there's only three or four five indications that they're the only things we can use it for no that's true um there are guides around those five or six things that i've talked about but um since then i've seen all manner of different indications come up um one of the things we haven't really discussed tonight is the approved prescriber route we talked about the sas fee in this bunch of slides i think i've got a quick slide on how to do this if you weren't going through a sass b through the tga but this again i mean you could literally write 20 or 30 for each letter of the alphabet um when i did this slide and the slide is getting old now there are through 2 000 tj approvals and i think that numbers morphed considerably 70 of our patients were were due to pain still the minority i think of cannabis sourced for medicinal purposes was uh was uh was legal legalized or tga approved of assessment approved and approved prescriber prescriptions most of it was still illicit so um of that you know we've seen an increasing prevalence of of mental health coming through um i'm seeing more interesting and more novel requests for cannabis use particularly with things like autism and people who've clearly also got an addiction but have a mental health comorbidity i remember from my training that about 30 to 50 percent of people with an addiction have a mental health comorbidity and 30 to 50 percent of people depending on the study with um with a mental health problem have an addiction co-morbidity and so it stands to reason that that we're often treating two things at once um some of the really interesting things that are coming out now is that we are seeing cost per milligram of drugs decreasing over time and we are seeing a proliferation of product staying ahead of the number of products is actually one of the hardest parts about doing this i work in an organization where we we we have on on-site pharmacy pharmacists i say we don't actually have a dispensing pharmacy and we're able to produce for ourselves large spreadsheets and keep an eye on costs but there are some websites um bhc can view or just can view c-a-n-v-i-e-w dot com that iu can view is a good site as a doctor you can register there's another one canada reviews with two ends canadareviews.com and anyone can register for that site you can get it and you can see all the products and all the prices and there's an absolute plethora of oils different types of lozenges capsules and inhalables available um very few um of the the sort of some of the novel stuff that you see in holland with it we don't have edibles yet but i think it's probably only a matter of time so when we look at pathways i talked to you before that there was about this authorized prescriber pathway it's a two-step process you have to get an ethical ethics approval from your um educational college whether it be the racp or the rac gp or the college of psychiatrists and then you go to the tga and they and they produce for you a list of product numbers that you can you can use and they actually sometimes do put down reasons that you can use for it such as um and this depends on the product company or or how they're pitched to the tga and the there's a limit to the dose particularly with thc if you go down the approved prescriber route for instance with thc products uh the limit is 30 milligrams per day if you've got someone who's got a comorbid addiction you still should run them through the sas b process um so they're and obviously they're under the age of of 18 you should run them through the sass speed process as well tend not to prescribe thc to children uh we tend to use cbd at times and i'll explain some of the interesting areas where this this is um this is coming to the fore in in a sec or two i'm going to skip through this slide just to say that there are cannabis receptors everywhere we know what some of them do we know what others do some things be just a complete mystery about the cannabinoid system but it's been an active area of research for 40 or 50 years the cb1 receptors and thc uh probably the the best researched cbd is probably more of a negater than than than anything it's a partial agonist with mainly antagonistic effects so it seems to work external to the brain even though it it is lipid soluble in terms of safety again this is away from the addiction side of things and more just in the sort of lethal dose sort of things it's interesting to think that psychedelics and cannabinoids are pretty low in terms of of of toxicity when compared to things like ghb heroin and even alcohol all right we've talked about that one before why would you use a medicinal rather than a street cannabinoid um well the reason why people use street cannabinoids is because they're cheap or because they're growing them themselves or they live in a jurisdiction where it's legal to have them but the reasons why one might want to use a medicinal would be around the quality issues around being able to control the ratios it's amazing when you work with former military personnel who have micromanaged you know dropping out of an airplane from 10 000 feet they like to micromanage their percentage of thc and cbd down to almost the milligram and so for some people it really matters how much they're having for others of course they're just looking at the big picture thankfully which is that they want to get well or they want to have a better quality of life now in some instances price is close to parity particularly with some of the we talked about in the bix moles is a very expensive product it's about 750 dollars a bottle um and that's a 50 50 blend of thc and cbd but you can get 50 50 blends up to about 90 milliliters of of um of a sass b type of product um and that will cost you around about 250 dollars and that will last you a month um or last most people a month so we're seeing that becomes very very reasonable it becomes achievable if you like for people who want to use a medicinal cannabinoid rather than the street cannabinoid um and and it can be really important for some people because um they may be in areas where there's high levels of policing or where they've been busted two or three times for possession um doesn't mean they can't have a medicinal cannabinoid it's always good to write down their forensic history by the way um i think everything that you that you write from the get-go is very protective of your decision-making around using medicinal cannabinoids um and can also inform you about you know where to step off with people as nick was saying if someone's highly tolerant to thc and you start them on a low-dose cbd product you're not going to get anywhere with them there there are lots of different delivery methods these are probably the main four that we see prescribed oils are probably the most common delivery form the the cannabinoids that we use are oil soluble and so they don't do well um as a dried tablet um capsules or are usually filled with oil with or or filled with micelles or tiny little capsulettes inside the capsule which are oil plus the cannabinoid there's a whole new technology coming around rapidly dissolving sublingual wafers they're literally like puffballs going off under your tongue and that's very very interesting and this lends us to the arguments around you know how can we improve bioavailability of course we already know a terrific way to improve bioavailability and that's to inhale the staff and people inhale you know thc they also inhale 50 50 blends of thc and cbd and there's even some cbd dominant flowers produced and these are clones that have been engineered to be high producing cbd flowers um i'm gonna skip some of that because i think we've covered it it's interesting if you look at the mental health side of things um that um that as as dick was saying anxiety ptsd mood disorder sleep disorders are very common amongst our otp population very common amongst our alcohol use disorder population and benzoys disorder population as well and cannabinoids show great promise there i'll come back to childhood indications if i get a chance shortly so we've talked already a little bit about this we go to a medical assessment and then um and then from there we think about what sort of treatment we're going to do there's an example of a sass b application approval and the idea with dosing in step four there is to look at um trying to get a dose which produces a clinical effect without having too many side effects um now it's not always possible but it's interesting by titrating doses up from from a low dose particularly thc as and just stepping through doses people often tell you when they start to feel the thc types of effects and whether those effects you know are clinically bothersome enough for them to back off on their dose um that was going to be a quick second stop but i'm going to just race through here the justification as nick pointed out isn't a sim simple indication has to be a chronic condition it has to have a medical name it can't just be writer's block as as as as nick said there has to be some sort of previous treatment and it doesn't necessarily have to all be opioids it doesn't have to be a medication it could be a physical treatment like physical therapy or psychotherapy um and and it doesn't all have to be surgical treatments either um so we talked about addiction i think i'm probably going over old ground here but you know there are things where we could look at at cannabis straight up things like cannabis dependence tobacco food alcohol cbd might be more useful with food than thct is probably not going to be helpful for food addictions because it's going to give you the munchies but cbd might in fact decrease uh your appetite slightly and there are some addictions as as as nick pointed out for which this is still a little bit uncertain um and and the way these sorts of things work of course and this has been demonstrated by studies that as nick himself has done is is is that there is some significant reductions within the bix moles and as you said the the sud abatement remains evident well beyond the treatment phase and as he said you know that's probably due largely to it having a more nrt type of effect than an otp type of effect but if we move beyond it i'm just going to quickly finish off the slide deck with a couple of um other interesting areas of study and then i'm probably going to leave about 20 slides at the end that i'm just not going to talk about at all there's been some interesting encouraging evidence in in autism for cbd and again this steps outside of the addiction medicine specialist pure realm but a lot of addiction medicine specialists are specialists in other areas and i've come from a general practice background so i see kids with autism i haven't seen too many kids lately with fragile x but i used to see them and i know that there's been some studies with fragile x using a transdermal form of cbd now normally cbd is incredibly poorly absorbed transdermally because of the the pharmacokinetics but there are some interesting matrix matrices being produced which allow improved transdermal uptake up to about 18 to 20 percent so this is actually a really significant outcome because it allows you to treat kids that can't swallow or who refuse to take medication and certainly across the board with these three groups that's something that we will see from time to time um there are areas for instance within within the fragile x group which is you know it's still too early to say whether this is going to be helpful but because there's such a helpless group of people that it's actually a really important study you know we talk about doing studies on things where there's a million other treatments you know nick and i were talking last night you know we can talk on and on about you know using cbd for anxiety but there's a hundred treatments for anxiety but how many treatments are there really for kids with autism or fragile x and the answer is good treatments are far few and far between and so you know this is an area of really interesting prop uh promise um seeing improvements in things like deliberate self-harm improvements in sleep and anxiety amongst the autism group but there's unfortunately still insufficient power to to point uh in one direction definitely with autism with adhd the systematic reviews are still insufficient evidence but there is some pointing towards a direction in hyperactivity and impulsivity we move on to dementia the canadians have probably led the world in studies with dementia and they've used mainly synthetic cannabinoids to do the studies of course if we look at systematic literature reviews the first thing they say is they need more rcts um but there is statistically significant improvement in mental state examination um and the the synthetic cannabinoid used in this study was incredibly well tolerated with only mild adverse effects improvements included things like appetite sleep decreased pain and decreased neuro psychiatric symptoms we look to the future we we're obviously you know we've only got two cannabinoids that we're currently playing with in the australian market but there's got to be more out there um and there certainly is uh in the next slide i can go through some of them um there are some costs and shortcomings with fido cannabinoids and they are expensive to produce they are getting cheaper to produce but i guess as time goes by we're going to explore new and novel agents i'm going to get nick to talk a little bit about this because i think he's probably got some um some comment on this um but one of the most important things that we need to be mindful of is if we transition away from these two cannabinoids we need to to ensure that there's good quality control moving forward there's a slide on some of them please don't don't don't write them all down if people want copies of some of this stuff later they can we need to look at ways to improve bioavailability um we're we're we're only getting a little bit along in this direction we need to go a lot further with this the oral bioavailability is quite low it's quite interesting people experiencing um you know miracle cures this sort of flight to health on you know 0.1 or 0.2 of a mill of cbd um it may not be anything more than a placebo effect given the oral bioavailability um looking at ways to bypass first past metabolism such as transdermal preparations is really um really helpful obviously um the smokers have already worked it out if you vaporize or inhale a cannabinoid you've got far superior bioavailability to anything else yeah we've got since i wrote this slide i think i'm now getting tga application 42 000 and something or other we've got now two registered products when i wrote the slide there was one um there's this huge plethora of products out in the market we don't know which one to prescribe and whether or not prescribing something with you know 12 milligram per ml of thc versus 10 when married with 10 milligrams of cbd really matters um it can be very very difficult we've gone through the first half of this year getting a lot of our inhalational products from the usa and from from canada and a lot of these things don't come in boats they come on the back of commercial jetliners and commercial travel in australia or into australia has dropped by 90 percent and so there's been huge product shortages with inhalation products making it very difficult to keep up because every time you have to do uh a change of product you have to go back through the tga and get approval for it and there are very few inhalational products that you can get an approved prescriber for um in fact there's only one or two most of them you have to get a sass feed and that can take time and then you have to write the scripts it's even worse if they're um if you have to do this for a veteran because then you have to get dva approval if you want dba funding for it dva does fund it with um with the approval from a treating specialist in the in the field of expertise usually a pain specialist or a rehab specialist now i've said along the way that's pain specialist in general sit with this position statement of opposing medicinal cannabinoids but it's quite interesting when you engage pain specialists one-on-one that a lot of them are prescribing cannabinoids and if you can pick out the ones that do prescribe them and you get an approval letter from them for your cannabinoid um prescribing for a military veteran then you will get dva approval for those patients as well okay um look over to nick i think we pretty much covered the sorts of things that i was going to talk about in this little slide section so i'll stop sharing and um hand over thank you very much mark um we uh we do have a few minutes for further discussion or questions there are a couple of things in the chat but nick did was i interrupting you did you have some did you want to make a comment no i've been answering chat questions some really great um questions coming through for those of you who have been looking at it some issues around cbd and safety and driving and work and the issues there there's no concerns around cbd will not test positive thc in a urine or saliva sample so there's no concerns there the cost keeps coming up just to be really clear a drug can only be on the pbs if it is a registered medicine and most of the medicinal cannabis products are not registered medicines so it's not as though there's a conspiracy out there it's just that there's a process and the medical cannabis companies really need to you know they want their drugs subsidized they need to get their medicines registered there was a question about why that hasn't happened um of course it's not for you or me or anyone to to um to decide why private companies do or don't take certain actions but what's what's your opinion about why they yeah one of the things is patent control here and really um you can't really patent thc or cbd for anything just about any condition you might think that it's worth using someone's already documented that so you can't there's no ip there's no sort of patent so so all a company can do is patent a formulation so they can patent you know a topical product or pac with you know little bells and and and whistles attached to it but the thc the very next company can come along and basically say yeah well yeah we'll do that too and basically what we're seeing is we we don't really have a pharmaceutical industry here what we have is a medicinal cannabis company set up um and we've seen this in north america as well um these companies are actually their target and their focus is to sell lots of medicinal cannabis not necessarily to do the traditional pharmaceutical route which is do the research which takes you around 10 years and around 20 million dollars of clinical trials to establish evidence of safety and efficacy and then get your your product licensed now if one of our australian medical cannabis companies went down that journey um well i don't necessarily give him an edge over all the elements kind of we've ended up in this funny space in australia and even worse in north america where um there's there's some research going in from the medicinal cannabis companies to look at specific indications and to get the evidence up but that's a really small element of most of the medicinal cannabis companies they're not putting a lot of money into r d or clinical indications um and i can't see that changing in a hurry um the there's only one pharmaceutical company that has that you know has done the work and they're the makers of you know the cbd for childhood in australia i want to mention companies or brand names so there's only one company that's really done any of this work in getting thc or cbd licensed in its own right i think the other thing is that the ubiquity of of illicit cannabis the fact that i mean if you came out with a um an antihypertensive that was novel or some drug for congestive cardiac failure it's not like you can grow it on a tree um you know chop it up put it in a vaporizer and smoke it and or you'll get it from behind the pub um and that's one of the other differences is that you if you enter into a market with a novel agent that that uh can't be accessed by the public then it's incredibly easy to it's much easier i think to do the research it is no cheaper it's still as nick said 10 years and about 20 million bucks um to do it um but you're competing against a product where we already know a huge slice of the australian population are using cannabis from illicit means and most of our medicinal cannabis patients are probably a drop in the ocean compared to the medicinal cannabis patients we never see which are those that are currently buying it from illicit sources and so to be able to do that research is hard although when we've actually done sort of surveys of um consumers there is a very strong preference for oral sort of pharmaceutical style products rather than people you know um punching punching um cones um you know you know like not a lot of people really you know unless you come from an illicit cannabis background where you've been you know using bonds and joints all your life most people are not interested in that like they're really not um and and so i think there is a market for a proper product um yep as as to follow up what nick is saying when we did our um well it's not finished but our ongoing trial in chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting um the older people are incredibly not interested in the psychoactive effects of of cannabis they want to be relieved of their nausea and vomiting quite obviously they don't want to be high and so that's actually been a study that's hard to recruit to because a lot of people don't want that but nick or and or mark there's an interesting question in the chat from john saunders about the down scheduling of cbd uh as i was about to type a response to that one so first of all firstly it was scheduled to schedule four a few years ago when there was no product on the market and then it was down scheduled to uh schedule three um so yeah so the scheduling schedule three means an over-the-counter product but a schedule three still requires a pharmaceutical company to register that product with the tga yeah so we still don't have any company that's gone and registered a cbd product with the with the tga but the other sort of sort of trick to what the tga did is they said we will register up to a 50 milligram per day dose but a company still needs to go and demonstrate evidence of safety and efficacy of a cbd dose of 50 milligrams or less there are no conditions that you treat with 50 milligrams of cbd or less so it was sort of one of those sort of looked good on paper i can't see it ever happening i don't see in australia that you will be able to buy cbd over the counter at a pharmacy simply because it's sort of like a trick question like go and show that cbd at 50 milligrams or less works for something doesn't uh well no one knows what it would work at those doses yet other than a placebo well-being effect um and it still requires a company to go through a tga licensing process okay guys i think it's it's just after 8 30 i'm going to ask our two speakers to answer what i hope the audience will think is a useful practical question if you're considering prescribing a medicinal cannabis to a patient with one of the conditions being discussed this evening what practical steps would you recommend that doctor does because i'm thinking of throwing my hands in the air after this discussion so um and i would ask for both nick and mark to prepare a couple of comments about what practical things would you like our clinicians to be doing can i go first and let mark finish because i think mark's got much more experience than me first and foremost you can't do it in the public system particularly effectively unless you serve clinical trials so get like you've got to work in private so that's the first step secondly all that regulatory stuff that mark was referring to sounds a little bit complicated but it is an sasb application most of us are familiar with that and once you've done it once or twice it's not that hard and the pga don't even really review it they just want to make sure that works in base so it is possible it looks complicated and tricky but it's not really and overall guys if we can prescribe drugs like methadone or some of the antiretrovirals or you know if we can prescribe those drugs uh thc and cbd are kind of like you know remarkably safe and not that complicated most of the principles of thc prescribing mimic opiates you know very similar concepts start low go slow build up look at tolerance forget your side effects titrate dose to clinical effect if you work in in addiction medicine most of these concepts would be straightforward so it seems as though it's complicated but it's really i mean there's a bit of sort of fiddling around with paperwork but once you have done that once or twice it all falls into place and there's certainly nothing complicated in the in the pharmacology or the you know the prescribing issues understanding the understanding the quagmire of products available as mark was highlighting that can do your heading but you know because it's not like we have a registered you know you just get your mims out and you prescribe the thing in mins so i would i would advise get familiar with one or two companies with two or three products that they have and you just stick to those thank you mark so i think i think i'd want to mirror some of those comments i think but also what i say is i think you don't need a lot of education to start prescribing medicinal cannabis but you probably should um consider enrolling in a course and these are subsidised by different royal colleges to the rsc gpp do a course over over about a day um and you can do some online courses it doesn't take a lot of reading to get around it it's a bit like if you did a methadone prescribing course in the in the in the 80s early 90s a lot of it was more around the legislative requirements um and about the paperwork and making sure that you you know you understood about takeaways starting doses registering patients how to exit patients how to write a script um how often you should monitor a patient what sort of things you should look out for rather than whether or not you need to get your head across 150 different products and i think that's that's the first thing do do some sort of educational um pursuit it doesn't need to be exhaustive you don't need to spend a long time if four hours of cannabis cb uh you know continuing professional development will get you a long way along the track i think the second thing is that you you need to just use common sense when it comes to taking a history and when it comes to prescribing when it comes to follow-up so as nick said i'd probably try and familiarize myself with a pure cbd product that i felt confident in i'd use a product that was a cbd dominant product maybe have somewhere between one and three milligrams of thc and 100 milligrams of cbd and familiarize myself with that product and i familiarize myself with a balanced product this is all these are all oils by the way um and maybe a thc dominant product as i said so maybe three or four oils and a couple of flowers that i was comfortable with a balanced flour which has some cbd and thc in it and maybe a thc dominant flower it's rare i think you'd need to go much beyond 20 but i have seen flowers at 30 and i've seen these new sort of bubble burst type of t-55 products coming out on the market which are very high strengths tic i don't think that's really necessary um i think you probably need to make sure you take a decent history of your patients and you need to document what you've written down very very carefully what you've taken very carefully around addiction don't be shy to prescribe to people with previous addiction histories just note it and make sure that you check box to state approval and you get the state approval number and you put that on the script when you're writing it's like writing any other s4 or s8 script and treat it as if you were writing a script for for one of those products so that you use numbers and words and that if you've got repeat intervals you make sure that you you you're clear on that sort of thing check when your sas b is going to expire make sure that you just renew it each year if it needs to be renewed um the the the devil's in the detail really it's around follow-up so you just with anything you could prescribe people um anything from from from methadone to antibiotics to medicinal cannabis but if you don't follow up your patients i guess that's really where things fall down and i think you you want to see an outcome whatever the outcome is if it's about a bad outcome you want to know about it as soon as possible if you don't follow up your patients and you're not even hearing about the bad outcomes and i think you're sort of missing a really important part of of the process so those are probably the main cause just a little bit of education but don't overburden yourself with a 400-page tone on the stuff um regular top-ups of education familiarize yourself with products with a few products that you can manage and and and finally um finally just make sure that you you take a good history and and you document it properly and you follow up properly that's about all i'd say on that thanks mark um someone's actually asked do you have any good suggestions for cpd cpd program for people to do the college yeah well i think the rscgp runs some some um courses on it um i'm not sure that the racp is doing that yet um a lot of the product companies they never will unfortunately a lot of the product companies are doing uh have training um there's a whole once you get into the cannabis side of things again i don't want to go through and name names of of of pharmaceutical companies or or or online uh webinars that you can you can do it but if you typed in um cannabis webinar into a google search you'll get 30 responses literally hitting you in and that's enough i think yeah mark thank you very much i think we do want to wrap it up um last comment uh richard has asked me to check with our two speakers to see if they could address any unanswered questions um in writing which we can circulate to all prescribers um whose emails we we've got a list of all the people that have logged on um look i think it's it's now time for me to close the session i really want to thank our two speakers for a very very interesting lockdown knock them down soccer too and presentation on uh medicinal cannabinoids and something that is an evolving and and uh challenging area we had over a hundred people register which is a world record for us i think and a very very interesting evening so thank you all

oEJz2jySdeU,Medicinal Cannabis for Endometriosis | Ask The Experts with Sarah Maree Cameron,2021-03-12T23:00:15Z,[Music] welcome to another edition of ask the experts my name's sarah marie cameron i'm a host on the triple m network and also an ambassador with endometriosis australia and part of the one in nine endo warriors that we have here in australia now marching to endo or our endo awareness month is a little bit different this year given all the restrictions that are happening in different places throughout australia so we thought why not bring the experts to you and thankfully we've had so many people send through their questions along the way if you ever need any details or you want to reach out for some help or more importantly donate because every single dollar is well spent in research and and helping to look after all of the endo warriors throughout australia you can go to endometriosis australia.org now today's ask the experts is an incredible one and i'd say the one that we got a plethora of questions sent through for i'd like to welcome to our ask the expert session today dr mike aymour a senior research fellow at nickim health research institute at western sydney university and phd student and also a research uh researcher along with dr mike aymour justin sinclair thank you so much for joining me today now the topic that we're going to be covering today is that of uh medicinal marijuana or medical cannabis whatever you want to file it under it's one that plenty of people have lots of questions about and how effective it is for helping those people manage their symptoms and flare-ups with endometriosis so either one of you can take it away do you want to talk about the difference i think the key one here between cbd and thc yeah so look i think we'll let justin take that um justin's phd just to give him a little bit of context is actually on specifically on medicinal cannabis for endometriosis so he is very much the expert in this i'll let him take the lead and if there's anything i can add i'll jump in thanks mike so yeah the it is an interesting questions one that comes up quite a bit so one thing to make clear is that cbd or cadaver dial and thc or delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol are just two of over 144 cannabinoids that have been identified in cannabis now cbd oil of course has gotten a fair bit of media attention recently and one thing i want to make really clear though is that there seems to be a myth going out there that cbd is perhaps the medicinal aspect of cannabis and that thc is really unused illicitly and that nothing could be further from the truth so thc even though it is the uh active constituent within cannabis that is um around not only its analgesic effect or its pain relieving effect but also that kind of intoxicating effect that it is um it's it's uh also very useful for things like chronic pain so the idea that you use thc and that you would always get intoxicated or high really boils down to dose cbd on the other hand is a non-intoxicating uh cannabinoid uh very very interesting research coming out about it uh you know for uh its anti-inflammatory effect and obviously it also has an analgesic activity and what you generally find in australia uh is that you can have cbd rich products that are very high in cbd and low in thc you can get the opposite of that which is products that are predominantly thc and low cbd but the ones that are prescribed mostly particularly for chronic pain not necessarily endometriosis but chronic pain in general are what they call balance products and that's where you have generally equal amounts of both thc and cbd so i think when it comes down to it is that it's going to be very uh it's going to be individual for the patient um depending on the symptoms that they're presenting with and how severe the pain and other associated symptoms are of their endometriosis and also the the way that their endocannabinoid system which is a entire neuromodulatory system that we have in our body which we'd know nothing about if it wasn't for research into cannabis and how that actually works so we're all slightly different um and so you'll find what might work for some women for their endometriosis might not work for others i think that would be the case for a lot of the treatments that would be prescribed to not just endometriosis sufferers but anybody you know everybody's got the secret diet and the best workout tip so as always it's horses for courses now when we're talking specifically with endometriosis here what data do we have to work with not much is the answer um really uh so some of the work that justin and i have done is mostly been looking at what women in the community already tell us they're doing um and so we've got data from australia and from new zealand and most of the women or most we we assume almost all of the women in australia and definitely all of the women in new zealand we're using illicit cannabis so illicit unless uh you know they haven't been getting it through medical channels um and so they self-report that this really does help their pain um and it also helps other symptoms like gastrointestinal issues you know obviously we don't say it in our academic manuscripts but you know endo belly i guess digestive problems nausea uh bloating uh sleep issues you know whether that's associated with pain or something else and also mood you know um you know women with endometriosis often have you know some mood disorders you know like many women or many people with chronic pain so we've got this self-reported data the problem we don't know and this comes back to what justin was saying before is we don't really know what they're taking you know if you go and buy you know basically a bag of weed you don't generally know how much thc is in it how much cbd is in it um and i think justin will correct me if i'm wrong but most of the obviously historically when you've been wanting to buy cannabis you've been wanting mostly to use it to get high so a lot of the strains have a high thc count high percentage which might be great for pain but obviously um one of the issues that is coming up as we talk about this more is impairment you know so um this is something that we see in in the community is definitely women are saying yes it's great it helps my pain it helps my symptoms it helps my sleep but one of the things we don't really know is are they over medicating in a sense you know are we do we not need that much thc to get the great pain relief um and so then you can still drive you can still go to work you can still not you know if you've got child caring responsibilities all these things that we know people have told us that they're worried about um and i'd say you know one of the potential issues especially for something like cbd uptake is much greater than the research that we have to support its use no so it's kind of it's very popular but actually when you try and dig into it as a researcher um there's not as much there for to support the claims in humans especially and i don't know justin is that fair like it's a it's a yeah that's a very fair statement i think the um yeah just getting back to what you were talking about particularly when it comes to thc is is the is the driving um because that is something as you said that a lot of women that we've spoken to through focus groups and otherwise are concerned about because it's very odd is that australia actually yesterday was the five-year anniversary of medicinal cannabis being legal in australia and and the driving laws have not changed so there is still the potential that you could be legally medically prescribed medicinal cannabis uh by your doctor and that if you were had your tongue swabbed at a mobile drug test that you would potentially be charged um so there really does need to be a push uh you know federally and and by the states as well to look at the uh these laws because the problem is is it's it's detecting presence of thc at a very very low amount and it's not actually detecting impairment at all it's nothing like a blood alcohol um reader where you know 0.05 we know that that's uh you're going to be impaired over that all this test does is test for presence and so there really does need to be some uh more robust research and hopefully some legislative change around that to protect women for what is now a um you know or anyone using uh cannabis for chronic pain or anything else um for what is now a medically prescribed medicine absolutely that is a deterrent for you know endo warriors and then other people who might be prescribed it as well and also those people who have to give urine samples for work and that they need to be clear as well as you say they are being prescribed and it is all above board and all legal but the laws haven't changed so definitely a deterrent there so there's clearly a lot of work that needs to be done now for somebody who is actually considering having this conversation with their general practitioner and i know that this would vary from state to state with the laws that are available but how does one go through their gp and start that process to see if they qualify can they get it what states can and can't get medicinal marijuana or cannabis yeah look that is a very great question that's one that we get all the time and i think the important thing to state from the get-go is that any medical practitioner in australia can prescribe medicinal cannabis so it's not like they have to be a specialist or anything like that a gp you know specialist doctors they can all prescribe the way that they prescribe is through what's called the two main ways the special access scheme category b and or they're a authorized prescriber now essentially all that means is it's not as simple as going to your doctor and they write a script and you go to the chemist so what really happens is that they need to make sure that medicinal cannabis might be right for you that you've maybe had um you know poor outcomes with some of the other types of more orthodox medicines that have been tried and then they can submit a form and that form uh is all done electronically it goes down to the tga um down in canberra and they approve it um if if the form has been filled out correctly and then from there it goes to state approval and then literally you get told where which uh pharmacy to go and pick up your prescription from so it's certainly not uh it's something that can take sometimes a couple of days to maybe a week um to actually occur uh and i guess one of the challenges that we have also at the moment with the medicinal cannabis products in australia is their cost um is that the the cost for these products because they are quality assured they are standardized and that's just a fancy word to make sure that every single time a batch is made you've got a standardized level of thc or cbd every single time and it's also quality assured for you know things that are harmful so it's checked for things like okra toxin aflatoxins heavy metals pesticide residues all those kinds of things there's actually a specific um therapeutic goods order just for medicinal cannabis products so you can rest assured at least that it's a very safe product and it is quality assured um and i think that uh you know at the end of the day most people would like to know that what they're taking is is uh safe you know i know many women that have now gone down that path of legal prescription the other on the other hand there is the recent news about uh which many people have probably seen in the media about cbd oil being available at your pharmacy and that's uh there's so can you just go down to your pharmacy and get this now for something like endometriosis and the answer is no and the reason there's a couple of reasons behind that number one is that they're still you know trying to work out what kind of conditions can a pharmacist prescribe for and i think it's fair to say that something like endometriosis which is a chronic health condition is maybe not best managed by a pharmacist that's probably best managed by your um you know your specialist doctors and so i i don't think that that's probably the the best way that things will go forward we might see the legislation change over time but at the moment the best recommendation would be to make sure that you're seeing your doctor because there are particularly with cbd oil there are some interactions that can happen with other medicines and so that's important for your doctor to be aware of yeah for sure as with any medication that is prescribed to you without a doubt just to double check that it's not going to interfere with anything else now we did touch on very briefly before about you know getting a roadside test and the thc coming up and that effect of having you know this is legally prescribed to you a lot of people question how does it feel in comparison to another strong pain relief because a lot of endo warriors get prescribed some very strong medication and that medication you know can definitely relieve pain but you know you read the backs of them and it'll say do not operate heavy machinery or you are not driving and i myself know that some of the medications that i've been prescribed i was not doing anything i was just on the couch because i was not fit to go anywhere let alone work or drive so what is the comparison with uh having cbd or thc so that's a that's a great question and is it a matter of fact it is one that we're about to start a research project on um justin and i have a student who's about to start working on a project which encompasses this because you're exactly right um i you know i've been i had my gallbladder removed a few years ago they gave me indones for the post-operative pain and i definitely was not going to be driving i was i mean that's really what it was i was but you know one of the things that justin and i have talked about is it's bizarre so i can take that and i can drive and it's legal um you know even if i'm impaired it's legal medicinal cannabis is treated separately differently despite the fact that it is also as justin mentioned if you buy medicinal cannabis it's quality controlled the amount of thc and cbd is controlled this is the same kind of process that goes into making endo you know you have the certain amount you take it um but it's being treated differently and that's probably due to the long-standing stigma of cannabis as you know a recreational drug rather than a medical one so hopefully that will change but one of the things that we agree with and and we really you know something we really want to look at is we expect that things like endone like valium other benzodiazepines all these medications that we know women with endometriosis are being prescribed um they do impair you know um and so one of the things that that we are also interested in we haven't touched on it yet is this idea of the substitution effect which is something which is really interesting and that's just a fancy academic way of basically saying when people use cannabis they tend to use less opioids or other medications um so we found that you know when women reported using cannabis for the endometriosis they use less opioids they use less benzodiazepines they use less other drugs and so considering the addictive potential um of some of these especially something like benzo long-term benzodiazepine usage you know that's something which is not just the impairment that they caused but you know we're hoping that you know this would allow women to reduce those other medications and in theory that really should be healthier now there's been a couple of anonymous questions that were sent through asking about the use for oil such as this for a long-term usage versus those short-term endo flare-ups bursts whatever you want to call it how effective can these oils be at treating those two types of pains which you know those suffering with endo are constantly trying to combat because we do have one thing that we use for long term and the thing that we go to when we're having a really bad day or week yeah look that's a it is a uh important point one thing i guess to raise just from the get-go is that there's multiple ways that you can take cannabis um so for the majority of the the survey work that mike and i have done previously looking at a list of cannabis use predominantly most of the the people were inhaling it um so you know smoking it or vaporizing it and the interesting thing about the cannabinoids and terpenes in cannabis terpenes are just a fancy name for essential oils they're what gives cannabis that smell but they are therapeutic um and they have a very far they have a much faster onset of action when it's inhaled so you inhale it usually within five minutes it starts to have an effect um and it in in some ways would allow uh people to adjust their dose so that they're like okay i can feel the pain subsiding i don't need any more whereas the oils on the other hand because you're ingesting them they have to go through a little bit of a process uh you know with absorption and the liver and all those types of things and they take a little bit longer so that can take anywhere between 30 minutes to sometimes two hours before it comes into effect but the difference between the two which is a really good point is that inhaled forms generally will only last for about two to three hours for their therapeutic efficacy whereas the oils when you ingest them they can last anywhere between six to eight hours and so there's this obviously if you can keep the oil uh levels at a at a level so that they don't dip too badly so that you can experience the pain again you should be able to get doses that that you know coverage if you will um throughout the day and particularly for sleep it could be quite important because if the pain is waking you up you could take an oil at night and that should be able to cover you through that that pain management but yeah it's it's an important thing when it comes to the the dose the dose is so important the dose when it's titrated properly for the patient you should have some pain relief and you you shouldn't necessarily feel high or intoxicated so i've spoken with many chronic pain patients over the years and once they get that dialed in that's exactly what they report they report that they experience that pain relief um but they don't necessarily feel high so yeah that's a good point to make i guess that's the same as if you're being prescribed in done or valium or something else you're finding the dose that works for you and that's going to take its time especially if you're new to it now one of the other questions that we got sent through from jade was asking do we have any studies or evidence about any effects that this may have on the brain after long-term use so on medicinal cannabis that i'm aware of um yeah so when we look at medicinal cannabis because it's you know the research for it has largely been been um stifled for the past 90 years but it's picking it up picking up at a pretty serious pace now there are obviously a lot of studies from illicit cannabis that are suggesting that you know long-term use could cause problems for a developing brain particularly so in the very young usually they a lot of doctors uh would advise you know no cannabis use before mid-20s uh simply because of brain development and things like that but the one thing that a lot of those studies don't take into account is that they they were looking at this data retrospectively and not actually looking at the products that was prescribed so were there any contaminants in there were there any adulterants could that change the outcome and the answer is probably yes so we do need to look at um longer term studies when it comes to uh safety for standardized quality assured medicinal cannabis products but specifically also in the endometriosis population there there's been no clinical studies uh to this date that i'm aware of so really it's such early days that it's hard to tell and we don't have enough studies with this so it is kind of a wait and see but for now still very safe for people to have prescribed i think that's fair to say as long as they're under the care of um you know a medical practitioner and um there are obviously some things that probably you need to be a little um well cautious over so if you had a history of schizophrenia or you know mental health conditions in your family or you already have that kind of presenting then there has been some studies that suggest that cannabis could potentially unmask some of that um but again if you're if you're with a um you know a doctor that's taking care of you that's going to be all part of the the questions that they're going to ask and it's certainly part of the questions that we have to ask when we look at recruiting for clinical trials here's a question and perhaps this might help some of our endo community put the hard work on some members of parliament what do we need from the australian government be it at a federal or state level so that we can get more of these studies money we need no i mean i know it sounds very good but we need uh we need funding you know um obviously the the federal government has released some money for endometriosis which is fantastic but if you look at how much money dementia gets for example you know diabetes heart disease they have similar cost of illness burdens to endometriosis you know our research found it was nine billion dollars were actually 9.7 billion australian dollars a year um there's a similar burdens to other really serious diseases and endometriosis gets a fraction of the funding and you know it's it's hard you know it's hard for us to build big trials it's hard for us to recruit it's hard for us to do a lot of the work we need to because there's only so much we you know like if you don't have money you know you're really limited to what you can do um and it just we we just need more we need more targeted support you know dementia my my friend who is a dementia researcher has many many chances each year to go for dementia funding there's all these different dementia grants nhmrc dementia fellowships you know we need something like that for endometriosis and pelvic pain we need the support we need more funding we need more career opportunities to bring on young researchers you know and mentor them we just need it to be taken seriously i think that's the main thing you know is that you know we can do these reports we can write about how much it impacts women but to make a difference we need to run clinical trials on things like medicinal cannabis and that costs money and we need salaries and to be able to pay for our research assistance and all of that um you know so we just need the support and we've got studies showing that australia is unfortunately ahead of the rest of the world where a lot of countries have one in ten people suffering from endometriosis we have one in nine so we've got even more sufferers here in australia and yet we don't have anywhere near as much funding as what this deserves for how common because it is it's common yeah it's not only is it common but it's just you know the impact as you know like you know i can only speak from the outside but you know when we when we do this research and i write these papers it's it's awful it's awful yeah you know um and there's literally not an area that i can think of that is not negatively impacted in women's lives and so you know not only is it common it's just you know we've got to if we had great treatments already and you know this was something that could be managed really well you know it's common but you can take a pill and it's you know that would be very different um but we're not we're not currently able to manage it that well for many women so you know that's that's where we really need to be looking how do we shorten that time to diagnosis how do we reduce the impact how do we you know um you know stop it happening uh before we wrap this up uh can either of you recommend perhaps a websites that people could go and have a look at because i know that many people would be interested in doing some more reading perhaps some studies or countries that we can look at while we wait for australia to catch up yeah there's actually a um for those that are interested in medicinal cannabis in general there's a website uh for a charity registered charity called united in compassion so united in compassion was founded by lucy haslam who was the mother of dan haslam who was the one that really started lobbying for medicinal cannabis in australia so on the united and compassion website if you sign up and you can access i think it's over 50 different uh videos from world leading experts talking about everything from you know cannabis use in cancer or all the way through to the endocannabinoid system and i don't think i think there's a video of me on there talking about endometriosis but there's apart from that not much on endo unfortunately but uh yeah particularly for those that are just interested in learning more about cannabis and the endocannabinoid system and how it works in the body that's a free resource that they could access well mike justin it has been an absolute pleasure to speak with you this is a topic that so many people are going to continue to have many questions on for a long time to come but i think you've sparked enough interest right now and i hope that plenty of people go and you know do some online searches and hit up their local members of parliament and keep campaigning and spreading that awareness thank you both so much for everything that you do in this field as an indo-warrior myself i'm very thankful thanks sarah thanks sarah and if you would like any more information or you would like to donate endo

Gvn9xqTmKww,Introduction to Medical Cannabis by Dr. Stacy D&#39;Andre,2021-11-17T22:15:35Z,all right good morning my name is megan ressler i work in the cancer education center in rochester minnesota at mayo clinic we're joined this morning by my colleague janine cockle and angie mourad and janine will do an introduction of dr d'andre in just a moment so we're happy you're here to learn more about medical cannabis just so people know we're recording this session for viewing we are appearing on screen but you are not but we want this to be available to people that aren't able to join us for the live um you can view it again later or share it with other people that you think might find the information interesting that we're sharing today we'll have our presentation and then allow some time for questions and answers at the end there's a q a chat function on your screen so if you have any questions for us we encourage you to type those into the chat and we'll see which ones we can get to before our time ends we would also encourage you to like and follow the cancer education blog on mayo clinic connect to learn more about upcoming webinars that we have topics that we're having coming up soon are tai chi understanding your blood counts and acupuncture there's also lots of educational resources and a social component to mayo clinic connect so if any of that interests you i encourage you to check that out and then we want people to know that today's session is informational not intended for medical advice and that cannabis laws whether they're dispensed for medical use or not varies state by state so you may need to do some homework based on where you live to find out more in that regard so janine i'll go ahead and turn it over to you thank you it's my pleasure today to introduce our speaker dr stacy deandre trained in medical oncology excuse me in hematology here at mayo clinic in rochester minnesota about 20 years ago she's practiced in oncology medicine in california for many years and just recently returned here again to mayo clinic in rochester to start the integrative oncology program she's also an oncologist working with the brain tumor team as well so with that i'm going to turn it over to dr d'andre welcome thank you thanks so much for inviting me today to to do this lecture so today's topic will be an introduction to medical cannabis and again just a quick disclaimer again we're not intending any medical advice here this is really just educational uh again cannabis is still considered a schedule one drug and legality does vary state to state and if you're interested in medical cannabis again check with your local process and work with a knowledgeable provider in your state so cannabis has been around for a long time the plant actually predates humans uh and we've evolved along with the plant um it used to be used for clothing and for rope and food uh especially the hemp type of plants that uh really yield quite a bit of product early use in chinese medicine was used uh many many centuries ago and hemp was extensively used in the 1600s in the new world but it wasn't until the 1800s that dr o'shaughnessy reintroduced cannabis back into the medical community and at that time it was used for epilepsy and rheumatism different pains and aches and at that time people were using it as a tea or tincture form it really wasn't used in inhalation form uh bayer and other companies as marketed in this uh old timey uh bran cough syrup uh one night and if you look at the ingredients that that must have been one night a very uh interesting concoction but it was uh it was used in formulations for many uh indications in about one-third of marketed drugs but this essentially went away in 1937. uh there was a tax act it was called the marijuana tax act and it essentially made cannabis illegal so all of these uh concoctions basically stopped at that time so in the 70s cannabis was put on schedule 1 status and what that means is that the drug really has no medicinal value it is ranked up there with heroin and lsd and which is kind of confusing because we're using it medicinally and it's legal medicinally in many states so the legality of cannabis is extremely confusing and changing so so keep an eye out for what's happening in your local region but also also federally so in the 1990s this was a major discovery they discovered brain receptors for endocannabinoids and we learned that there's this whole system in our body called the endocannabinoid system and so i'll touch on that a little bit coming up now in 2012 oregon washington uh legalized recreational use with other states to follow so in california shortly after that we did have a recreational use and it was uh extremely um well utilized in california um and then today there's still limited research despite all of this progress in terms of legalization we still have a very difficult time conducting research and that is because of schedule one status in order to conduct research in this country uh if you want to do a clinical trial you have to have a special license you have to get product from the government it has to come from certified uh nida growers and it's it's very very cumbersome so most of the human data and trials actually are coming out of europe and israel and we'll touch on a little bit of that coming up a little bit about the biology of the plant so cannabis is extremely complicated has many many components to it there are over 100 phytocannabinoids present in the plant about 40 of which is cannabidiol or commonly known as cbd thc is another endocannabinoid and thc acts on specific receptors in your body these receptors are found all throughout the body in it in fact in all mammals so this has been around you know this system has been around for a long time so the two main receptors are called cb1 and cb2 cb1 receptors are found in the nervous system especially in the brain areas of memory pain emotion and movement interestingly they're not found in the area that controls breathing and well that we'll talk about why that's important now it's also interesting that cb1 receptors are 10 times more prevalent than opioid receptors in your body so fascinating system cb2 receptors are found in the mostly in the immune system cells of the body widespread so what is this endocannabinoid system and what does it do so this system is composed of the endocannabinoids so some chemicals which i'll go over and also the receptors now these chemicals that we have in our body they're very similar to cbd and thc especially thc and they play a role in appetite blood pressure bone growth immune system inflammation pain memory reproduction and muscle tone so this is a widespread ancient system in our body and we're you know this is a recent discovery or you know in the 1990s so it's it's really amazing that this has just been discovered and we're just scratching the surface in terms of what does the system do and why is it important so here are the two main main endocannabinoids there are others and again they're learning more about this all the time but two of them include two arachidonyl glycerol which is the most abundant uh endocannabinoid it binds to those cb receptors in your body and again it plays a role in the immune system pain and appetite anandamide is very similar in structure to thc so this is floating around in your body and it's responsible for the bliss or runner's high that people feel it's also found in chocolate which is maybe why we like chocolate so much uh it also plays a role in pain appetite memory reproduction and sleep so there is a theory that in certain disease states we have dysregulation of our endocannabinoid system so either there's something wrong with the levels of endocannabinoids in our body or there's something wrong with the receptors or our body is not clearing or maybe clearing too much of these endocannabinoids so this dysfunction may be associated with these disease states especially neurologic issues such as parkinson's huntington's glaucoma but even in common things such as metabolic syndrome diabetes hypertension anxiety depression ptsd schizophrenia fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome migraines fertility problems neuropathic and other pain syndromes so we're learning more about this and how can we improve our endocannabinoid system in terms of treating disease there are things that we do know that modify our endocannabinoid system so things like nsaids like ibuprofen acetaminophen they can block the breakdown of endocannabinoids so by raising the levels of your endocannabinoids you get pain relief which is which is a underappreciated a mechanism that these can work exercise we all know you know people feel better when they exercise well it increases the expression of your cb1 receptors social play inner increases our endocannabinoids in the brain alcohol does the opposite so alcohol actually dampens down our endocannabinoid system and two common things in our diet turmeric and black pepper they also augment our endocannabinoid system so let's move on to talk about some of these cannabinoids so cbd and thc are the most common cannabinoids that you hear about in the plant itself now cbd is just everywhere on the market now and usually that's coming from hemp so we'll talk about that separately but this is from the whole plant you're getting these cannabinoids plus other cannabinoids as well so what does cbd do so cbd by itself may have a role in anti-anxiety anti-seizure it's neuro-protective and has anti-inflammatory properties it can penetrate through your central nervous system but it really doesn't bind to those cb receptors that thc does in fact cbd has over 65 molecular targets that are listed below and it's an incredibly complicated system cbd may calm down the effect of thc thc is what most people are familiar with and it's responsible for the psychoactivity of cannabis the euphoria or high that people feel however it has many other functions and effects on the body it does function as a muscle relaxant in animal models it is has anti-cancer properties it has anti-seizure properties plays a role in nausea or anti-nausea it lowers blood pressure it can be bronchodilator so opening up the bronchioles pain modulator anti-inflammatory and others as listed now not only in the plant is there thc and cbd there are other minor cannabinoids and it seems like they're discovering new ones every day uh and they all are a little bit different so the plant again is is so fascinating it has so many parts to it that we're just really starting to learn about so a couple of these minor cannabinoids include cbn this is a stored a degraded product so as the product becomes old uh it's cannabinoids can kind of degenerate into cbn and this can be really a sedate sedating type of cannabinoid so you'll see that marketed in some of the sleep remedies and and type of things some of the other cannabinoids minor ones include cbc and cbg um and these may play a role in pain and anti-itch and anti-inflammatory now it's important to remember that in the synthesized version so the type of cannabis that you get from a prescription you're not getting these minor cannabinoids you're just getting an isolate or a synthesized version of a cannabinoid so many people who are advocates of plant-based medicine feel that you get more out of the actual whole plant extracts cannabis seems to work very well it's called the entourage effect where you have all of these things present in their natural form they work together and so that is and that's been actually studied in animal models and it seems to be the case um and again as i pointed out other things can interact uh natural things that we utilize so chocolate capsaicin turmeric those also can interact with our endocannabinoid system so there is a raw form of cannabis that most people don't aren't really aware of and so before you heat the plant there are these raw cannabinoids and they are an acidic form when you take the plant and you heat it it changes it so for example cbda is the acid form of cbd and this raw form has different properties so many people will use the roth plant they'll actually juice it or just have it in the raw form as an anti-inflammatory cbda may have a role in anticipatory nausea and vomiting which is something in our in the world of cancer we is a problem there aren't really good medications for that um but that's only been studied so far in rats so we don't have a great human data yet in terms of if it works in people and again in animal models and cell culture models there is some anti-cancer effect from these type of cannabinoids terpenes are another component of the plant so terpenes are a class of compounds that are produced by plants and the reason they do this is to protect themselves so these cannabinoids or these terpenes give the plant its characteristics aroma or flavor and they detract herbivores and parasites basically now terpenes can either be activating or sedating depending on the type of terpene in the product and some products are marketed for this reason so things that are more sedating may have more mercene or lavender type of product and here are just some of the examples of some of those terpenes so mercine is a very earthy flavor and aroma it's very relaxing linalool is from like lavender it also is very sedating and anti-anxiety limonene is from like a lemony citrusy type of terpene and that's actually more mood elevating so a little more activating pinenes are terpenes that smell like pine or some spices like rosemary and those are quite activating and then transcaryophyllene is a terpene that is kind of peppery and that may play a role in pain and anti-inflammation so the terpenes are another whole component of the whole of the plant that go into how it may work in the body so again increasing the complexity of this plant so what is the difference between hemp and cannabis so this is a super common question so basically they're both cannabis they're both part of the same family they're just different types of plants the hemp plant is very tall it has a very long stock and it doesn't have as many flowers so you see more stock and less of the flowering product um now hemp is used as a scavenger plant so they use it to help clean up um toxic sites you know it really it sucks up a lot from the ground and for that reason it can have more contaminants in it and you need to use a lot of hemp in order to extract the cbd so what you're getting from hemp is mainly cbd now the problem with hemp products that are marketed online is they're often mislabeled and one study showed up to 70 of products that were obtained online were mislabeled meaning they either didn't have what they were supposed to or they actually had more thc in them than they were supposed to and that can be a problem if you do drug testing for work and you think you're taking something that doesn't have thc and whoops it actually does so again hemp products are legal online you can kind of get them everywhere state regulations are still pretty fuzzy um you know especially in states where nothing is legal so again uh need to really check with your state and see what's going on with regards to that now cannabis uh the traditional plant that you see is very has a lot of flowers um it has more cannabinoids in it so you're you're getting thc cbd and a lot more of those minor cannabinoids it's more potent you get more of that entourage effect where all of the plant is working together there's less contamination uh because you don't need to use as much product and again you know it's still schedule one so we have to get our products through dispensaries however when you do that you know you're getting a clean product because they have to test these products for purity for the you know you know exactly what is in them they test them for um contamination and lead and heavy metals so that is why many of these products that the dispensaries are so expensive because there is a lot of quality control but again you're getting a high quality project product so a little bit about how cannabis is taken so there's many ways to take cannabis and these all can be useful depending on what the indication is so inhalation is um you know kind of the more more known route mainly just because of recreational use it is the fastest onset people either vape or smoke the flower juicing is when you're actually taking the leaves from the plant and literally just grinding them up and juicing them and that's where some people get that raw or acid form of the cannabinoid oils are called full extract cannabis oils they are pulling out basically mostly these are high thc products and some people may have heard of rick simpson oil's extremely potent really thick tarry stuff is very hard to titrate and sometimes they'll tell people oh well you know you take a grain of rice size so what does that really mean it's it's very hard to titrate so i'm i haven't been a super fan of that because it's it's difficult to measure especially for people who are new to cannabis medicine i actually prefer tinctures um these are more diluted they come in a with a dropper with a with a measuring uh dropper on it so you know exactly what you're getting and you can it's easier to titrate these tinctures they go under your tongue you leave it under your tongue it's called sublingual administration um they can have an onset of you know 15 minutes 30 minutes but a lot of people don't really hold it under the tongue and they swallow it so then it really is takes a it's more like an oral onset which takes longer to absorb into your body um but but they don't work right away so that's an important thing to remember now edibles are you know things that come in a pill or a chocolate or a gummy bear or some some form of an edible that you're actually eating and that can absorb over one to two hours so very slow onset but the effect can last for many many hours so some people really enjoy using edibles at night time for some of the benefits for sleep and pain because they last for a very long time some people will use suppositories it's really really controversial um they may not be really well absorbed and it's not a form that's commonly recommended there are topical cannabis products so you may have seen cbd creams or cbd thc creams and some people use those for arthritic pains uh kind of aches and pains that type of thing and then there are transdermal patches and those are quite expensive but in just another alternative method to getting this these products into your bloodstream so a few more words about the way that you take cannabis so again oral absorption is highly variable and what's interesting is that how you feel after you take an oil product is different than how you may feel if you inhale the product the metabolites how your body processes the cannabis when you do an oral product they can be highly psychoactive so some people don't like that and they prefer inhalation um so it's it's highly variable how your particular body metabolizes the these products and what effect you feel from them again oral absorption can take many hours to reach peak levels it can affect the enzyme system and we'll talk about how that interacts with some may interact with some drugs and these uh cannabinoids are stored in the fat and they're released at very low levels so they can stick around for quite a while um tinctures again they're diluted often from an alcohol extraction they are faster onset but again many people are just swallowing them inhalation again takes only a few minutes for peak levels but then they decline more rapidly so they're good for things that you need a very quick onset but it doesn't last very long so many people might use an inhalation route for nausea because it'll work quickly here are some drug interactions so you know cannabis effects can affect the liver enzyme system which is responsible for our metabolism of other drugs so there can be drug drug interactions coumadin or warfarin some specific seizure medications not super common but they can be affected by cannabis and then statins at higher doses some uh antibiotics and antifungals and blood pressure medications can be uh their levels can be changed by patients who use cannabis so it's always important to check with your pharmacist and your doctor to make sure there are no interactions and if there are you need to really work with a knowledgeable provider to make sure that you're you know safe if you're using cannabis medicine some other interactions to be aware of so an interesting interaction is i think a good one um patients who are using opioids oftentimes if they are using cannabis they're able to reduce their opioid usage and in some studies they actually can stop their opioids so this is under intense study because of the opioid crisis and you know a lot of people think that cannabin cannabis medicine may be a way to help people uh get off of of opioids um now we talked about how there are no uh cb receptors in the brain stem which is a good thing so the the risk of overdosing from many drugs you know when you're taking opioids and other benzodiazepines and other things they decrease your breathing and that's why people overdose is because they stop breathing so cannabis doesn't affect that center in the brain so it's safe and with regards to that um now there can be excess sedation however so if you're using alcohol or any kind of adivan benzodiazepine like valium there can be a lot more sedation if you're using them together also anticholinergic drugs so i listed them below but common things like benadryl wellbutrin atrovent those are called anticholinergic drugs and they can increase the psychoactivity of cannabis and stimulants those may also increase paranoia and psychiatric side effects when using cannabis so just a few things to keep in mind with other drugs that may interact with cannabis so why are we using cannabis so the national academy of sciences report in 2017 found conclusive and substantial evidence for cannabis use to treat chronic pain in adults as an adjunct for nausea for patients on chemotherapy and for multiple sclerosis spasticity there are prescription cannabinoids available and these have been around actually for a long time marinol is a synthetic thc it's been around for many many years and we have used it for nausea and for appetite stimulation in cancer patients nabilone also a synthetic thc sativex is a product not available in this country but in europe and in canada it is a plant extract it's a one-to-one ratio that is used for many indications including cancer pain syndros is a liquid uh synthetic again used for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting and for anorexia now these synthetics are not widely used um because a lot of people don't like the side effects because it's just thc and so it's really not like what is in nature so they're not really widely used now epidialex is um the first fda approved drug that contains a it's plant-based it's a plant a plant-derived cbd very high-dose oral solution that's used for children with these rare forms of epilepsy this is just a study moving on to some of the indications for uh use of cannabis this is a typical study done in the cancer arena uh this was many a large study almost 3000 patients were followed 80 percent had severe pain and insomnia these patients were given product either thc or thc with cbd and they found that many patients at one month 66 reported an improvement in their symptoms and at six months the majority were still using cannabis and were still reporting improvement in their symptoms their quality of life improved their pain improved and they also reported improvements in sleep fatigue nausea anxiety and depression and in this particular study 36 percent of the patients actually stopped using their opioids again there were some side effects these are common uh manageable a few patients do stop using it because they don't like the psychoactive effect but you can see the percentages are pretty low and we'll talk about side effects in a few minutes now this was a this is kind of a typical study where patients are given cannabis and then you kind of see what happens however randomized trials in cancer pain they really are have been poor quality they have the there was a meta-analysis done where they basically said they're we don't we really can't make heads or tails of the data um they said that in this particular meta-analysis it is unlikely that cannabinoids or cannabis will reduce pain for everyone they may work for a small number of people under close supervision of specialists however we do need more clinical trials done um using products for the treatment of pain so what about anxiety and sleep so for anxiety cbd has been shown to be helpful in a variety of situations the dosing of cbd is highly variable much more so than thc so cbd can also reduce the side effects of thc and that's why many patients really do like a combination of cbd and thc together and for anxiety if cbd alone is not helpful sometimes a little addition of thc can be useful now sleep studies have shown an improvement in short-term sleep outcomes in individuals with sleep disturbance associated with obstructive sleep apnea fibromyalgia chronic pain and multiple sclerosis and most of the studies do use thc um again you have to be mindful of the side effects of thc especially if you're doing an edible or a tincture it can be long lasting through the night which can be beneficial but you can kind of wake up sometimes a little bit groggy i have many many patients that are taking cbd alone for sleep because it's easy to get you can just get cbd anywhere the problem is it doesn't work so cbd alone may actually impair sleep cbd alone especially at lower doses is actually activating so it but it can help if anxiety is the main reason why you're not sleeping so it's important to again why are you using cannabis and what are the what is what's the underlying problem is it anxiety or is it just insomnia um again the terpenes are important and again certain products have terpenes that are designed to help with sedation so things like lavender or a little bit of cbn or um mercine so the terpene profile and the cannabinoid profile is important with regards to nausea and appetite the studies have been pretty mixed at least in the cancer area different products have been tested different settings makes the studies really difficult to interpret many of the studies have been done with synthetics so we don't have a lot of data on just plant-based uh plant-based uh products and again the synthetic products are widely available but rarely used and most of the literature would suggest that you know it can be useful as an adjunct for nausea that is not being relieved by standard antibiotics our nausea medicines these days are really good and so many patients you know they don't need to go as far as using cannabis because it can be managed with other medications so i get this question probably on a daily basis what can i use to treat my cancer can cannabis treat my cancer and the answer to that is we don't know now if you're a rat or a mouse you're you may be in good luck because there are many animal studies and cell culture studies that do show that cannabis does have anti-cancer activity both thc cbd and the combination have shown activity however it depends on the cancer type and it even depends on the specific where that cancer came from that particular patient that it came from it can vary you can have two different patients with breast cancer and they make a cell culture from those from that cancer and it will respond differently to different products so it's extremely complicated there's very little human data so we just don't have any clinical trials really there's a tiny study done in in the uk on brain in brain tumor patients um it needs to be replicated and they're actually working on that right now getting together a larger brain tumor study using a one-to-one product but we just do not have you know good clinical trial data on whether it can treat cancer and that will probably remain that way until cannabis is deschedulized and we can make research more accessible and i think that that needs to happen in order to move forward one little point i'd like to make about immunotherapy this is a recent study out of israel and they showed that patients who are using cannabis that are on immunotherapy had worse outcomes so i do point out to my patients that are on immunotherapy until we know more i would suggest not using cannabis or at least using the lowest amount possible fortunately with immunotherapy we don't get into as many of the side effects as we see with with uh with chemotherapy but until we know have better data on the effects of cannabis on immunotherapy i do tell my patients about this study so how do we dose cannabis so the the golden rule is to start very low and go very slow thc is limiting so if patients go too fast and they take too much of a product that has thc they're going to know it and they may never want to do it again and that's you know that's not the way we want to do this we want to start with a very tiny dose and slowly titrate that up many of my patients will start with dosing them at night time and slowly increase to where they have a therapeutic effect if needed depending on what the problem is sometimes we add another dose in during the day and i have my patients journal the effects so they know kind of what's going on they can document the dose and what side effects they're feeling and stop when they achieve a therapeutic effect more is not always better and more can get you into more side effects again the dosing is so highly variable especially with oral uh edible products it's really important to work with a knowledgeable provider um inhalation can be useful for breakthrough symptoms or for something that you need a quick onset of action for like nausea so there are when you do go to a dispensary there are many many products it can be overwhelming um even in the state run centers where a product is you know still somewhat limited they still have a lot of products in there they have different ratios so a very common thing that you will see is cbd thc and it will say like one to one or it will say two to one so they're what they're talking about is one part cbd to one part thc which can be very broadly useful now for people who are sensitive to thc and don't really like the effect of it you can find a product that has a higher amount of cbd so that would be more like a five to one so five part cbd to one part thc and if you're extremely sensitive to thc you could go with an even higher cbd product now cbd again by itself may be useful for anxiety maybe pain at low doses it's been useful for just clarity and well-being all the way up to very high doses the epidialex product being useful for treating epilepsy in children again the main question that you should ask and your provider should ask is why am i using cannabis what is what are my problems that i would like to treat and then that will point you to the particular product and the way that you use cannabis so it's very very individualized and it takes some you know it takes some uh trial and error it's it's not uh it's not one size fits all for sure so here are some of the side effects of thc so you can have lowering of blood pressure you can have a fast heart rate you can feel thirsty some people feel euphoria i don't know if that's a side effect that's probably a good thing um but other psychoactive effects like paranoia and some short-term memory loss can occur spatial perception alterations and feeling disoriented feeling drowsy red eyes bronchodilation constipation um thc is a muscle relaxant so kind of like lowering of the motor tone so your muscles are more relaxed and that could be a problem potentially for older folks who are a fall risk again dizzy dizziness and even nausea can occur at high doses patients do develop tolerance to thc so you need higher doses over time sometimes and again thc can interact with your liver enzyme system now there is some dependence seen with thc however it's much less than with benzodiazepines or with opioids there also is withdrawal um now the withdrawal from cannabis is typically mild and most people liken it to caffeine withdrawal so you can have some insomnia be irritable nausea restless and it dissipates after a few days and the reason that it's not a horrible type of withdrawal is because again cannabinoids are stored in your fat and then they're released at very low levels over time so you have a gradual decline in the levels of cannabinoids in your blood and again there is an addiction potential with thc or cannabis but it is a low percentage especially in our medical patients we do uh we are careful in those with the psychiatric history or those with the history of substance abuse cbd um you know does have side effects um it's everywhere you can just buy it anywhere online but it can have side effects so at low doses actually can be activating at higher doses fatigue diarrhea weight changes it can change your liver test we have liver test abnormalities on your blood tests in the epidialec study the high dose they found that the high doses were associated with fatigue and anemia diarrhea and feeling jittery and there are about five to ten percent of people out there that are extremely sensitive to cbd so again trial and error very individualized in terms of how cbd affects people here are some precautions so we don't use cannabis and active cardiac patients because especially the thc especially inhaled thc can drop your blood pressure and re and increase your heart rate so that's not something that we want in somebody who has active coronary disease um there is a fall risk in elderly patients especially in the first few weeks so if there now they have done studies and cannabis can be useful for even very elderly patients but you need to be extremely careful because of the dizziness and sedation and it's preferably have somebody with you um if you're an older patient um we don't advise driving we don't you avoid we want don't people use to use in pregnancy um avoiding use in patients skeptic disorders or addiction disorders avoid use especially the inhaled form the actual flower in those that are severely immunocompromised because some of that can have mold contamination and we don't want mold if you have no immune system and again as i showed at this point i'm telling people who are on immunotherapy we should probably not use cannabis or at least lower that keep the dose extremely low because we want to have our immunotherapy work as as well as it possibly can again remember the drug interactions especially coumadin specific anti-seizure medications especially with higher doses of cbd again check with your pharmacist it's we do not see a lot of significant drug interaction but it's always important when you're starting new drugs um and with cannabis to make sure there are not going to be any adverse interactions so in summary most important question why are you using cannabis or why do you want to use cannabis so this will help your practitioner point you towards the right product the right ratio and the right route of administration and again remember it's a trial and error error process we always start very low and go very slow another important question is have you ever used it before how did you react to it in the past so many people have used it in their youth and they really liked it or they really hated it and that's important because if it really if you liked it in the past chances are you will like it again if you had it some people had when if they tried it when they were younger and they got kind of paranoid or you know just didn't like that feeling of thc well then that then you might want to choose a product that has more cbd in it so more you know higher ratio of cbd to thc so that's an important question i think to uh to ask always remember medication interactions be mindful of them remember the precautions that we talked about and again the golden rule start low go slow keep a journal record your side effects and um titrate to where you're feeling some benefit so i know this was a whirlwind through the cannabis uh cannabis uh journey here um and i hope that that was helpful for people at least as an introduction i've been using cannabis medicine in my practice in california for many many years i've seen the benefits i hope really hope in the future that we can get some great clinical trials going that's what i'm excited about being back at mayo clinic is to really um do some high quality research in this area so with that i thank you for your attention and i'm happy to take any questions well i'm just going to jump in and say that was excellent excellent excellent presentation thank you so much i learned so many so much from this so i really appreciate it and i know there are some questions coming in but maybe i'll start off with a couple i have real quick sure so you had mentioned something about you can build tolerance so people who are taking this for pain or whatever reason they build tolerance and then they need to increase dose is that common or frequent yeah it ha i mean it it over time that can happen so in in my experience um it's it's not that you have to go up a tremendous amount though so i've had patients on you know for example you know they were on maybe 10 milligrams for pain at night and it just wasn't quite doing it so they went up to 15 and then 20. but it wasn't you know they weren't increasing it by huge amounts but it can over a long period of time you you know you definitely do develop some tolerance okay great and then for people who want to try cbd you had mentioned um that it's hard to make sure you know that the product is safe or has what it says it's in there how any guidance on how people might go about that so if you are in a state where cannabis is legal you can buy see you can get high quality cbd products at a dispensary so that will that's going to be your best bet because it's tested you know exactly what's in it highly regulated a little you know it's expensive but it's worth it because you know you're getting what you're what you're paying for um there are companies out there online that do sell cbd products i would investigate that company i would look for you know good manufacturing process i would look for you know whatever you can find in terms of their quality control before you just buy some product on amazon or anything like that so i would i would research you know companies and make sure that they have good manufacturing product okay great i'll turn it to megan i think she's been looking at the question sure yes so here's a question if i have understood correctly thc is also beneficial for patients with epilepsy not only cbd is this right so again most of the work has been done with cbd um thc does have some anti-epileptic properties but i don't think it's as it's not as well studied as cbd so now again going back to treatment you know what is actually approved for use is is cbd and that is only for children with epilepsy so at this point there is no indication for using cannabis to treat adults for example with epilepsy okay another question in a small percentage of people i have read that cbd can increase the anxiety it is if this is one of the possible side effects could you talk about that yeah so again about five or ten percent of people are really um like hyper sensitive to cbd and so if they're using cbd for anxiety and that happens again some people will add a little bit of thc and see if that helps them and again pointing out that cannabis medicine is it is challenging because how it works for one person isn't how it works for another person and and for someone for a particular patient who has anxiety cbd can be extremely helpful and for another patient it either does nothing or they don't like it so it's this wide variety of effects that you can see and it all comes down to like how how does your body metabolize it like what's happening in your own individual body and and the effects that you see from using cannabis sure here's a question can you schedule an appointment with doctors at mayo clinic if you're interested in starting you can um so so our um you know again there are doctors at mayo that are um that will certify patients for cannabis in the state of minnesota so again this is a state-by-state deal so if you are in arizona or florida there are physicians in those states also that can certify you through the state program um for example in our practice you know many of the oncologists will certify our patients for medical cannabis um my particular practice is in brain tumors and also in the integrative medicine field so many of the integrative doctors are also involved in this so so not every doctor will is is knowledgeable not every doctor um you know anywhere really uh has gone through training so you kind of have to ask around and find physicians that can certify you in your given state there's a couple questions that are geared to a specific um symptom or disease entity so they're they're wanting your thoughts on would this work for over active bladder parkinson's and or chronic bronchitis i can try a few different questions in there so yeah again um you know there's anecdotal stories out there for all of those but nothing you know there's no great clinical trials that i'm aware of and my i have to qualify that and say you know i'm a cancer doc and so my expertise has been in the use of cannabis for cancer and cancer related problems i do know that you know a lot of pa people have been using cannabinoids for um fibromyalgia chronic fatigue and there has been some some uh research done in parkinson's that's just not really my field um but i you know you could ask a neurologist and uh do some research on that here's one in regards to clinical trials are there clinical trials somewhere that have given statistical efficacy in patients using cbd and thc is there a way to measure the effects or is it all subjective uh read the first part again are there clinical trials somewhere that have given statistical efficacy in patients using cbd and thc is there a way to measure the effects or is it all subjective so so a couple of points so if you're treating symptoms then it's going to be subjective so if you're using cannabis for let's say pain it's going to be subjective so um whereas if you're using cannabis to actually treat cancer then you may have objective evidence that it's doing something and that's where we're lacking the data but again in europe they're doing studies in brain tumor patients where they're giving cbd thc and they're looking at their scans and monitoring hey are we seeing an increase in survival time you know so though very objective data so it really depends on what you're trying to what are you studying but the majority of symptom management um that's that's very that's very subjective data any thoughts on i know this is into your field either but someone's asking in terms of you've read or learned anything if it's been utilized either cbd or thc for autism patients have not i that's yeah not a little out of my little out of my uh wheelhouse question does it work for restless leg syndrome um again i've seen i have seen some reports on that i haven't seen any great you know clinical trials i mean there's anecdotes for everything right so you can find a you can find a story you can find a case report so it's it's hard to say for sure but but i can say that you know cbd and thc both have um relaxant properties so i have had people with like fibromyalgia um restless leg um uh pain syndromes where they have that chronic like the chronic pain loop um and they've used cannabis that and it seemed to help them especially at night time kind of calm down the muscles kind of help them sleep um in my experience cannabis has not been it's it's not like a pain medicine it's more like a modulator so it changes your perception of pain and it changes your perception of things but also there are all those other secondary properties like you know like asking about um chronic bronchitis well you know thc is a bronchodilator so does that you know turn into an improvement in chronic bronchitis i don't know but there is a mechanism behind it it does have a lot of other actions and muscle relaxant is one of them here's a question will it work for peripheral neuropathy um as related to multiple myeloma or just peripheral neuropathy in general there is there is some data um and one of the uh one of the things from what the bodies that study you know and make recommendations is that it may be useful for peripheral neuropathy so that's one of the pain syndromes where cannabis may be useful um they've studied it in um in about in inhalational form that's been the most studied in terms of treating peripheral neuropathy um we're actually hopefully launching a clinical trial here soon on cannabis creams so using a topical cannabis to see if that helps with peripheral neuropathy that's been induced by chemotherapy so i think more to come on that but it i think that there is is some rationale and some evidence that that may be useful sure how does cbd and thc affect immune compromised patients so so in terms of lowering or worsening of the immune system i mean i haven't seen any data in terms of that now when i'm taught when i was mentioning immunotherapy um that's a different that's different because when you're on immunotherapy you're taking medications to ramp up your immune system right so you're kind of artificially elevating your immune system to fight cancer and cannabis may what what cannabis tends to do in the body is we want it tries to maintain what we call homeostasis or it tries to achieve a balance so if something is out of balance it's going to try to make it in balance again and so for example if your immune system is upregulated it's possible that cannabis then sort of down regulates that and that may be why we're seeing lower responses with immunotherapy but if you're immune compromised i would say you know my main concern would be you don't want to use products that are potentially contaminated because you don't want to get some sort of bug or mold or something like that and develop an infection um and that is most common with like flour and inhalational they found mold growing on some of the um the cannabis so that would be my main concern if you're immunocompromised we kind of are starting to come to the top of the hour too so may have have to um halt the questions here just in the interest of time but do want to say that some of the other um comments that have come through just that this was a very helpful and informative presentation so we do want to thank you dr deandre for sharing your information and research that you've done and knowledge on this topic sure yeah it's been great it was wonderful all right so we'll remind people i know some people have asked about recording this session we do have it recorded it does take us a little bit of time to turn it around and post it on mayo clinic connect site but we will hopefully have that available to you in the next day or two so i want to thank you for joining us today and thank dr deandre for giving us her time this morning as well thank you thank you all right take care have a good day
Wiwaaz1fjeg,Medical Marijuana For Anxiety | Discover Marijuana,2021-08-18T12:00:12Z,tons of people use cannabis for anxiety today we're going to give you our best suggestions for using cannabis for [Music] anxiety welcome back to discover marijuana i'm tim pickett here with josh fitzgerald clinical pharmacist at deseret wellness cannabis pharmacy and we're talking about anxiety now anxiety in utah is not a qualifying condition for a medical cannabis card but something like 85 of cannabis users across the u.s report using it for anxiety at some point in time and it's really important for ptsd patients because anxiety is such a an integral part of that mental health condition what is it about anxiety that can be helped with cannabis josh um anxiety is kind of one of those things that just comes on randomly in certain people and cannabis is really good at acting very quickly when we talk about you know treating anxiety with traditional medications like benzodiazepines um and that's really what we're talking about right this this uh adjustment or that's the way we're yeah moving away from the uh the benzodiazepines towards something that's a little safer yeah that's what our patients are here for they're here to maybe you know use less of their benzodiazepines and substitute that with cannabis benzodiazepines take a long time to start working when you're having an anxiety attack of any kind you need something that's going to be able to work right then and there to control that anxiety and they also want something to help kind of mitigate anxiety attacks throughout the day also so cannabis is great for that cannabis and inhalation forms works extremely quickly and you can stay on top of that anxiety attack and treat it for long periods of time too so transition into a tincture of some kind that's going to give you a prolonged action of the cannabis to control your anxiety what is cannabis not good for in anxiety um at high doses cannabis can trigger anxiety and so patients that are prone to having anxiety attacks we really caution them and guide them through the process on dosing it correctly so they can avoid that so do you recommend patients start at some level of thc that's that's pretty safe and then work up yeah yeah definitely starting at a low dose we talk about like two and a half milligrams is like a beginning dose very small inhalations with their vaporization methods to kind of find the right dose that works for them and then as you become familiar with it and know how it works within your body you can increase that dose to help prevent and control anxiety attacks are there cannabinoids or terpene profiles that are more beneficial for anxiety and this type of uh of thing um what i when we talk about um strains and cannabinoids and stuff like that um we want to make sure there's lots of cbd there because cbd is going to help kind of control that thc be from getting you to a psychoactive or an anxiety point so lots of cbd and then we add in the thc too so tincture is a really good option strain wise we want to look at something that's more of a sedating strain like a hybrid or an indica um going with something that's you know got more of like a a pining or an earthy tone to it you're going to have a little bit more sedation properties with it whether you're using like sativa that's going to be more stimulating that can actually throw people into an anxiety attack or the anxiety will get away from them do you have products in there with cbn because i i've we understand that cbn is something that's on the rise for anxiety and relaxation and things have you seen products with that cbn um it does come with some of the tinctures that we have and so i recommend people kind of staying with the tinctures and and going that route with it yes cool um talk to me about a sample regimen for cannabinoid therapy say if i come in and i'm a patient with ptsd so i have a qualifying condition but a lot of that is anxiety triggering that yeah how would you start me off so we talk about you know winter year trigger times really with anxiety a lot of times people have anxiety at night and aren't able to sleep very well and so we're going to talk about edibles with them and using the edibles to get really good quality sleep to better deal with their problems during the day and and mitigate some of that anxiety during the day too you're taking the edible about an hour before bed yeah a couple hours before bed yeah and let it kick in and start working um if they have any issues beforehand they can use the faster methods that don't last as long like vaporization methods or even some tinctures too um during the daytime though we want to make sure that they've got a vape on hand 24 7 because when you have an anxiety attack you need something you can go to immediately to stay on top of it and help yourself through that period and that inhalation that really the vape cartridge is the quickest acting it is it doesn't take a lot of preparation super portable take it wherever you need to go very discreet very discreet yes when it comes to using flour though is there temperatures that tend to be better than other temperatures i always for a general rule just say start with 300 and kind of go up from there um and and don't get in anywhere past 400 degrees but that's depending on the person too and what they like and the cannabinoids that are in this one the strain that they're using and two the ones that they prefer and so it's kind of a troll out of trial and error but you know don't get in past 400 degrees for sure i would say and make sure that you're not overdoing it you know if you feel pretty good at one inhalation or two that third can cause that anxiety response and so i think it's important to make sure that you find where that dose hits the hits the just right dose as we call it in our dosing guide and then then you know yeah if you have a regiment or something that you're using for anxiety um please comment below we want to hear about your experience using cannabis for anxiety i think that the more we talk about it the the better we all are now as far as tips and tricks you know it sounds like inhaling keeping and keeping an inhalation method with you or available for those triggers sounds like something that everybody should if you're using cannabis medicinally then that's a good idea we also have sprays and stuff that you can use too so sprays are very discreet methods for dosing um and oftentimes it's not you're not in a situation where it's appropriate to be vaping and sprays are a good discrete option to just and those are sprays that go under your tongue they take about 20 minutes to take effect and they work for a couple hours usually and so that gives you really good time to kind of help in that situation the nice thing about the the uh those here in utah they're low doses yes there is a product that's you know 2.5 milligrams per spray that's a perfect low dose to just get it on board and there's different terpenes in those sprays too that you can use at different times of the day to help in specific situations too oh perfect yeah remember to always talk to your provider when you're coming off of any other medications especially benzodiazepines because they have some withdrawal symptoms and you want to be managing those with your pharmacist and your qualified medical provider when we talk about temperature and using cannabis for anxiety with temperature why do we want to keep that in that low temperature range so as the the plant is smoldered within that vaporization device um at the lower temperatures you're going to get more of a cbd profile to it more of those lower endocannabinoids when you get up into the high range you're getting more of the thc delta nine especially in anxiety that can trigger anxiety attacks or prolong anxiety attacks um so you want to say it's kind of a good idea for utah to eliminate flames and and combustion that's why we do it in in essentially the you know to keep that temperature down uh using those other cannabinoids for medicinal reasons exactly talk to your pharmacist and your licensed medical provider when you want uh more information about how to use cannabis for anxiety subscribe as we're gonna talk about and we're gonna release videos on conditions and the tips and tricks for ibs [Music] you

7cvcq3WyQlM,Medicinal cannabis - Changes to Special Access Scheme (SAS) and Authorised Prescriber applications,2021-12-16T11:47:40Z,okay good afternoon everyone and thanks so much for joining us for this afternoon's presentation on um changes to the medicinal cannabis um access special access scheme and authorized prescriber uh applications um so start i'd like to start by um acknowledging the traditional owners and custodian custodians of the lands on which they're meeting today um for those of us here in canberra that's then you know people but um i'd like to acknowledge that we're meeting across a large number of plans today and acknowledge um the all of the res the elders um past present and emerging in in its various lands i'd also like to extend the acknowledgement and respect to any aboriginal and torres strait islander people that we're here that we have here today um so again thanks for joining us um nisha's introduced me um already my name is petra bismayer i'm nick's um the director of the experimental products section um so we're the section that looks after access to unapproved goods or goods that aren't included in the australian register of therapeutic goods um and that's namely through the special access scheme and authorized prescriber scheme so in today's session i'll explain the key changes that we've made in order to reduce administrative burden for prescribers so i'll introduce you to five active ingredient categories for special access scheme and authorized prescriber applications for medicinal cannabis i'll outline the addition of certain medicinal cannabis medicines into the authorized prescriber established history of use pathway and i'll also give you a walkthrough of how to apply via the online system so the key points in terms of what what's changed are the approvals from yesterday are no longer granted from a for a specific product or brand but by active ingredient the approvals will remain specific to dosage form and indication however again some cannabis medicines have been included in the authorized prescriber established history of use list which means no ethics committee approval is required in order to become an authorized prescriber and to support healthcare professionals in prescribing we'll be publishing a list of available products on the tga website so i'll start with our decision to move to sas and authorized prescriber applications by active ingredient and these changes have been made in order to reduce the administrative burden for prescribers who were aware had to reapply for new product specific tga approvals quite frequently due to stock shortages and discontinuations name changes all of which unfortunately um are common in this industry so the move to approvals by active ingredient will reduce the administrative burden for prescribers who no longer require a separate approval for their patient if a specific branded product for example is out of stock or is suddenly discontinued um and approvals so while approvals are no longer granted for a specific product or brand we do recognize that there's the complexity of the cannabinoid content of medicinal cannabis products and so to account for this we're allowing submissions on the basis of broad category of cannabinoid content there's the approvals will remain specific to dosage form and to indication but the change means that prescribers can obtain approval for a category and then issue prescriptions for any product within that category without the need to reapply for tga approval each time and ultimately our goal is to improve patient access for appropriate patients so here i've included a list of the of the five categories that we'll be using moving forward hopefully you can see that clearly on your screen but um as you can see from the column on the right all of these categories are framed around the cannabidiol content of of the medicine so for example category one medicines meet the schedule for prescription only definition as uh laid out in the poison schedule or susmp and these products are comprised of 98 or more of cannabidiol included in the total um a cannabinoid content of the medicine any cannabinoids other than cannabidiol in the medicine are only those naturally found in cannabis and comprise two percent or less of the total cannabinoid content of the medicine and the medicine contains no other active ingredients category 2 products are what we're naming cbd dominant medicinal cannabis products these won't meet the schedule for definition so these are schedule eight products um that are a dominant in cbt so these products are between 60 and 98 cannabidiol or cbd with the remaining um cannabidiol sorry the remaining cannabinoid content being made up of other cannabinoids which may include thc category three products are what we're calling balanced medicinal cannabis products so in general there'll be approximately 50 50 thc cbd but the definition here is that the product is made up of between 40 and 60 cbd with the remaining cannabinoid content being made up of other cannabinoids other than cannabidiol and that may include thc um so for category four and five products um we've named them thc dominant medicinal cannabis products and thc medicinal cannabis products in recognition of the fact that we expect that most of these products will be thc dominant but the system does allow flexibility for um for products which are dominant in another cannabinoid so if you look at the definition here a category 4 medicinal cannabis product is a product which contains between 2 and 40 cannabidiol and the the remaining cannabinoid content is made up of other cannabinoids which we expect is likely to be thc um and and the the last category category five um medicinal cannabis products essentially um we're calling them thc medicinal cannabis products um but that if you look at a definition they contain between zero and two percent cannabidiol the remaining content is made up of other cannabinoids which may which may be up to 100 thc um so hopefully that explains um the five categories and this list is available on our website in if you go to the medicinal cannabis hub of the tga website and if you have trouble getting there you can just google medicinal cannabis sorry not google you should search medicinal cannabis on the tga website that'll take you to the medicinal cannabis hub and from there you can select the option for healthcare professionals and you can find a host of information in there including this this useful tool um but we are also publishing i should mention we are also publishing um on the tga website a list of products um which are available under each of those um categories um just in recognition um with the fact that there is some complexity there so sponsors will be declaring to us what category their products fall in and we'll be publishing those products on the tj website to assist prescribers and pharmacists another big change we're introducing um is inclusion of certain medicinal cannabis medicines in the authorized prescriber established history of use pathway um and so these are included in this pathway by reference to the active ingredient category their dosage form and their indication when using this pathway approval from a human research ethics committee or specialist college endorsement is not required before applying to the teacher to become an authorized prescriber of these products so it's important to note that only medical practitioners can apply to become an authorized prescriber other prescribers like nurse practitioners may still apply via the pathway but this pathway is only open to medical practitioners and the advantage of becoming an authorized prescriber is that an authorized prescriber can prescribe once they've become an authorized prescriber for for a particular medicine in for a particular dosage form in a particular indication they can prescribe to patients under their direct care now they need to apply to the tga every time unlike the sas category b so as you can see here on the screen i've included the products which are included in um the authorized prescriber established history of useless um so that's category one two and three products um so category 1 products have been included for the dosage from liquid and capsule and for the indications chronic pain and anxiety pedigree 2 products are also included for liquid and capsule and for the treatment of refractory chronic pain in adult patients or the treatment of refractory anxiety in adult patients category 3 or balanced products have been included for liquid and capsules in the treatment of refractory chronic pain in in adult patients so if if for example a doctor wanted to prescribe a product under these categories um they can apply directly by the ta by the tga portal which i'll show you through next without the need to get ethics committee approval beforehand um and there's there's no restrictions around um what doctors can apply or how many ssb applications you can you have to have done any australian medical practitioner can apply to become an authorized prescriber of these particular products um authorized prescribers do however have to inform us of how many patients they treated during a six month period and those six month periods are defined defined periods so from january to june and from july to december and uh reports have to be submitted within one month of that of the reporting period uh closing and i'll do a walkthrough of of the applications of how to submit an application to become an authorized prescriber um towards the end of the presentation but if for example a prescriber wanted to become um an authorized prescriber of um of one of these products for a different indication or a different dosage form or for a category four or five product they would have to either get ethics committee approval or apply for either south b pathway as normal so i've outlined here on this screen some a decision framework around a flow diagram on how to make a decision as to which pathway to use and as i mentioned the authorized prescriber route is only available for australian registered medical practitioners other other prescribers such as nurse practitioners may be able to use the sas be pathway and importantly authorised prescriber applications must be submitted by the applying medical practitioner themselves so the following these tools um are intended for doctors who've already made a decision to use a medicinal cannabis product and i just point out here too that unapproved medicines are not assessed by the tga for quality safety and efficacy and the medical legal liability for use of an unapproved good lies with the approval holder or the prescriber so you must have considered the use of approved and available treatments appropriate for the condition prior to the decision to use an unapproved good and you should check whether you're prescribing intentions meet the authorized prescriber history list that i i had up earlier so for example some prescribers may choose the category and then look on the on the tj website to find the corresponding products that are available that they may always wish to um to prescribe while others might might do it the other way around they might may know which product they wish to prescribe but not know what category that fits into so you'll select after you've decided that a medicinal cannabis product is right for your patient select a medicine that's clinically suitable for your patient and you may wish to refer to that published list of medicinal cannabis products that i mentioned under the five active ingredient categories if the active ingredient and dosage form and and indication is included on that list exactly then you can you can apply directly to the tta to become an authorized prescriber approval is generally provided for five years and you can then write prescriptions that would detail more information than just the category that um prescriptions should include you know active ingredients strengths um dosage form and whatever other information you think is necessary for the pharmacist to to enable the pharmacist to choose the correct product you may if you wanted to if it was clinically necessary you may include the trade name um but this is a decision um at the discretion of the prescriber and this is no different to prescribing any other other good once you've received tj approval if the product isn't included on the on the list establish history reviews list um you may submit us a sas category b application or you could obtain approval from a hrec and then apply to tga to become an authorized prescriber i thought i'd show you what the tga approval letters will look like under the authorized prescriber and special access scheme pathways and so as you can see here rather than the trade name that you might be familiar with seeing instead we've got the category of product here so um here we've got a category one cbd product that's for refactory anxiety in adult patients in on the sas letter we have the same thing we have a category 1 cbd medicinal cannabis product for a particular patient and again in the indication anxiety um and so as i've mentioned the the next step then is to write a prescription um and you you may choose you will need to put more information on your prescription in terms of what product you you wish to prescribe but to assist you with that um we've published a list we'll be publishing a list on the tgi website um with a number of products that are available within those categories um in terms of generic substitution this is no different from any other medicine so a pharmacist may wish to substitute a medicine if they think it's clinically appropriate too and that may require consultation with a doctor if it's necessary so for example if the prescription doesn't contain enough information to identify a particular product um they may wish to contact the doctor either to request a new prescription or clarify the prescription um if a new prescription is required um then that that would just be negotiated between the pharmacist and the doctor and there's no need then to go back to the tga for further approval and that's been outlined here on this infographic um so the the move to issue special access scheme and authorized prescriber approvals by the category of active ingredient is designed to reduce administrative burden and provide flexibility for prescribers and again this is to account for frequent product name changes and product shortages without needing a new sas or authorized prescriber approval letter each time so the five broad categories of active ingredient that i outlined earlier um is what you receive the approval for however it's expected that the prescriber includes enough detail in the prescription that the pharmacist can identify correctly selected so generally a prescription should include active ingredient name strength dosing information quantity inclusion of a brand name may be included if the prescriber feels that's clinically relevant um and as for any other prescription pharmacist decisions regarding substituting brands or whether a new prescription is required need to be made in accordance with normal practice may include consultation with the patient and prescriber and prescription law falls under the remit of states and territories so if there are any questions and regarding what's required on a prescription by law those should be directed to your um your relevant jurisdiction and we do have contact details for the states and territories available on the tga website i just want to take a moment here to mention a reporting of side effects um so we strongly encourage health care professionals to report any suspected side effects that are related to medicinal cannabis products or any any medicine that they're using reporting of side effects and problems helps us to understand the safety of a product and we investigate significant safety concerns as part of ensuring product safety in the australian community there's multiple ways in which adverse events and defects can be reported to the tga but the preferred reporting route is via the teacher website so next i'll show you i'll take you through how to apply um we our preferred application route is via sas an authorized prescriber online system um this helps reduce administrative burden um at our end also and helps um speed up the the rate at which we can approve applications um it also is intended to reduce the administrative burden um on prescribers and there's a number of features that assist so for example for sas b applications um if state or territory approval is required um that can be applied for in the same application form and i'll take you through that now for authorized prescribers there's advantages in using the online system in that you can do your six monthly reporting via the online portal and we can send out reminders um to you via the online portal um so even if you become an authorized prescriber for a particular product even if you don't treat any um patients during that time you still have to report to us that the number of patients treated as zero i've included the link here for how to use the portal but i'll um i'll share my screen with me um share my screen with you now so that you can have a bit of a walk through um system looks like the first step will be to follow the link that was just included on the on this slide um that'll take you to the regulatory and compliance portal where you'll need to select the special access scheme um so this this button is also used to become an authorized prescriber we're looking at having this updated in the near future to say special access scheme and authorized prescribers this will take you to the welcome page and here along the top here you can see there's a few different dashboards so to submit a sas application you'd use the sas dashboard and to submit an authorized prescriber application you'd select the authorized prescriber dashboard so take us now through an example application of how to become an authorized prescriber and as i mentioned any australian registered medical practitioner can become an authorised prescriber so you'll go to the authorized prescriber dashboard where you'll see on your dashboard history of products that you've applied for and you can also see down here further details including cloning or copying an application so i'll be selecting a new authorized prescriber application and the first step is prescriber details so these this information is filled out from your registration information and there's also an option here to change um your email address and phone number if those have differed from the information that you provided at the time of registration so the next step is to choose the type of therapeutic good that you'll be prescribing in our case as we're doing cannabis application we'll choose medicine and we'll have a look here to see if our medicine is included in the established history of use list medicinal cannabis products are included on the final page and you can see here um they are included by active ingredient category or circumstance um so category one medicinal cannabis product is one in which cannabidiol comprises 98 or more of the total cannabinoid content um and the medicine contains no other active ingredients and i want today i wanted to treat a patient who has chronic pain or a class of patients who have chronic pain so the code for that is ap131 so i'll say that yes my product is included in the established history of use list and here i'll choose my active ingredient name so i find it easiest to use the wildcard or the asterix as that helps us find parts of parts of names and i'll include cannabis so that only those relevant options are brought up here we can see the established history of use category one medicinal cannabis products have been included so i'll select this option and the available dosage forms are capsule and oral liquid i'll be submitting an or i'll be using our liquids so choose that option um if you know information about the product strength or trade name or sponsor or supplier you're welcome to include that information but that's not mandatory as you can see here mandatory information is indicated by the red asterisks um and if you wanted to upload any additional information you could do so um so then i'll save and move on to the next step which is the indication so it's important that you include the the indication is actually exactly as specified on the list um we do have intentions of updating the online system so that this is pre-filled but at the moment you'll just have to um fill in the indication it's quite pain wasn't it refractory chronic patients saving next and that takes you to the fourth step which is just a summary of your application so you can double check it a review of the privacy information and an agreement that you've read and understood the privacy statement then press submit so as you can see the application process itself is very simple for those products that are included in the authorized prescriber established history of use list and you can see the status of your application here on the authorized prescriber dashboard so i can see here that my application is under teacher review and in general we try and approve these applications within sort of five to seven days in the meantime if you have something that needs to be someone that needs to be treated more urgently of course you can always use the special access scheme pathway and those applications are reviewed within two working days of receipt so in order to submit a sas application um if you need if if for example um your product didn't meet the authorized prescriber establish history of use list or um if it was for a different indication or dosage form or if you're not a medical practitioner if you're a nurse prescriber for example you could use a sas category b pathway so you go to the sas dashboard and select new new submission the first step asks you whether you'd like to share the submission so this is a function that's available for people who work in in a clinic for example a medical practice where there's multiple prescribers and you'd like to share and view one another's applications so you can um have your site um included as an affiliated site and you could share your um your application with with affiliated sites so to share with other health practitioners within that within that site um so the first question is are you the prescriber um and for medicinal cannabis applications we do um require the application to be made by the prescriber themselves um next you'll save that that step again you can change any of that information if that's changed since the time of registration again we'll be selecting a medicine and we'll be selecting an um an active ingredient again i'll use that wild card function and this time i'll be using a category 3 unbalanced medicinal canvas product and the dosage form i'll be using the oral liquid and i'm wanting to use this in cancer pain and symptom management the next question asks you whether you need to apply to the state or territory um so this is um a decision that that needs to be made well the doctors need to prescribers need to understand the um the requirements of the state in which they're operating if you have any questions if you're unsure as to whether you require additional state or territory approval i'd recommend you get in touch with your state or territory health department and contact details are available on the teacher website for that so i'll select yes i do need to um notify sales territory and that cellular territory might be victoria the last question on this page asks you whether you wish to submit a category a notification rather than category b application um and in general it is easier for medicinal cannabis products to apply under the category b pathway even if your patient meets the category a definition and the reason for that is um that products that are in products must be imported on a product on a case-by-case basis um for for use under the category a pathway and that's as a requirement of um legislation under the narcotic drugs act so in general it's uh faster and easier to use the category b pathway for medicinal cannabis products so i'll say no i don't wish to submit a category a notification and here here i'll include information such as the dosage form so might be sorry the dosage frequency um and again if you um know information about the trade name or sponsors of supplier that you'll be using you can include that there um however that's not mandatory and the intended date of supply will be on friday you'll notice that the duration was pre-filled in is 24 months so in general sass fee applications are approved for 24 months and if prescribers wish to um include further restrictions they can do so on their prescription but it means that you don't have to go back to the tga for approval um so often so here i'll include the next step the fourth step is for patient details so i'll include information on my patient including their initials and some identifying factor their date of birth their gender if you know that if you're working in hospital and you know their mrn you could include that if they had a previous sas number you could include that and the diagnosis cancer pain with a clinical justification so clinical justification just needs to demonstrate to the delegate approving the application that you've considered other artg approved goods before before submitting an application to to the teacher um to use an unapproved good um so that might include a list of um some products that you've tried or considered trying um that weren't appropriate for that patient just enough information that um the delegate can see that you've considered other aitg registered goods before considering the use of an unapproved or experimental product i might say and and we'll also ask for some details of monitoring so for example for this patient you may deem that they need to be followed up um every two weeks for the first month and then monthly after that or whatever you deem is appropriate for your patient in their class circumstances the fifth part of the form um is the state specific part of the form so this is where the state requires some additional information so you'll include further information so this state for example um victoria requires details of names rather than just initials so we'd include and you might you'll need to include your prescriber qualifications and whether you have any supporting information again this is information that the tga doesn't see this is um specific to the state or territory in which you're applying and that then takes us to the last page which again is a summary of your application um and a requirement to read the privacy statement and consent um that you've actually understood that before submitting the application um so as you can see the sas there is definitely an advantage in becoming an authorised prescriber if the product is included on the established history of use um the process is much simpler for those products and you don't need to apply for every patient so where can you go for additional support so we've updated um our web pages so i mentioned the cannabis hub earlier that can be found on the tga website um and we've got a specific page which um includes um information for health professionals so we've updated that page as well as the page for information for sponsors and manufacturers and we've also created a number of support tools so um the description of the active ingredient categories which is the one i showed you earlier today um the list of medicinal cannabis products by um category of active ingredient that's again included on the tga website um and the authorized prescriber scheme list of medicines with established history of use that i showed you just now we've also updated a number of our guidance documents um so that's the authorized prescriber scheme um guidance document the online system guided by this document for both special access scheme and authorized prescriber scheme and we'll also be making slides from this webinar available okay so now we'll um stop for questions so please if you have any questions submit them by the live poll i also have a couple of pre-submitted questions that i can i can go through um so thank you for your time and bear with me while we have a look at the questions that have been submitted okay thanks everyone for your time um my colleague sakanya lingaratnam is um going to read some of the questions that have been submitted all right thanks petra it seems to be a lot of questions regarding what is appropriate to write on a prescription and whether brand substitution is allowed um for pharmacists so petra if you want to um clarify yeah sure gary might take us back to this um useful infographic that we had um so as i mentioned a script should include active ingredient name strength dosing amount frequency quantity for medication and number of repeats um so this is no different to any other prescription so once you've once you've received your tga approval and for a category of medication the prescribing um that what goes on a prescription is no different from any any other any other prescription so you may wish to include the brand name if you think that's clinically appropriate or if you think it's going to be necessary to help the pharmacist choose the correct product in terms of generic substitution that should just be done in accordance with normal practice so for example if a product was 10 milligrams per mil cbd and 10 milligrams per ml thc um there may be two brands that are available there um provided that the doctor hadn't ticked the box that says no generic substitution it would seem to me to be appropriate to to um to substitute those brands but again these decisions are decisions that are made at the discretion of the individual clinicians in accordance with pharmacy board guidelines or medical practitioner board guidelines or and yeah i guess if there was any any concerns about the the uh prescription being incomplete um then a pharmacist could call the doctor and clarify if a new prescription was needed a new prescription could be issued it just simply means that you don't need to come back to the tga to ask us for a new approval to use a specific brand of a product great thanks petra there's a few questions in regards to authorised prescribers and what these changes meet mean to their approval for their current trade name product um i'm wondering if you could clarify that yeah that's a great question thank you so if you're an authorized prescriber for um a product for um for particular products um and likewise with sas applications those um those approval letters hold valid for the duration of the approve the duration of approval that's dictated on that approval letter um however if you want to substitute for different for different brands or rather write prescriptions for different products you may wish to become an authorized prescriber or or obtain a sas approval for for the active ingredient category and that can be done from from today um and the i just want to point out that the the walkthrough that i just gave you now um is in the live environment um it was a test login obviously um but what you saw there is what's available on on the on the portal currently so those applications can be made from today um just as i did um in the example walk through great thanks petra there's a few questions in regards to compounding and whether the changes um affect extemporaneous compounding by pharmacists thanks that's a good question so at the moment there's no changes to extemporaneous compounding um however there was you may remember public consultation in january of this year where we consulted on extemporaneous compounding and we're likely to see changes to extemporaneous compounding from next year hopefully early next year which will require sas or authorized prescriber approval in order to extemporaneously compound great thanks pitcher there's a question in regards to schedule three medicinal cannabis products i just wonder if you could clarify oh thanks yep that's a great question so um some of you may be aware that um certain cannabidiol certain low-dose cannabidiol products were included in schedule three or pharmacist only of the poison standard earlier this year however it's important to note that those products were only included in schedule 3 if they're included in the aitg in the australian registered therapeutic register of therapeutic goods meaning that they've been assessed by the tga for safety quality and efficacy and unfortunately at this stage we don't have a single product that's included in a single low-dose cannabidiol product that's included in the artg so unfortunately we don't have any schedule 3 products at this stage however we do encourage we are encouraging sponsors to submit applications to the tga to register their products um and that that's an ongoing exercise great thanks petra um there's a question here in regards to existing sass fee approvals for individual brands do we need to resubmit suspe applications to to transition to categories instead or will this be done automatically great thank you so you can continue to use your sas b approval for a particular product but you can only use it for that particular product if you want to use other products i'd recommend applying for to use applying for a generic approval so that you can use multiple products within that category without the need to come back to the tga for approval wonderful thanks patrick there's also a few questions regarding um applying for various fruits of administration or dosage forms within the same category i'm just wondering if you could clarify that's possible for ap applications great thanks so um for authorized prescriber applications um if you remember the code the codes that i showed you on that form um they need to be applied for separately um so authorized prescriber applications will need to be made for for one category for one dosage form but you can include the two for the two indications so for example you could apply for category one products for oral oil for chronic pain and anxiety um and then you could also apply it separately for category one products um for capsules for chronic for chronic pain and for anxiety in the one application form category um three products again they're all specific to dosage form so you will need to do a different authorized prescriber application for different um for different dosage forms great thanks patrick there's also a few questions in regards to specific state and territory applications um do you want to clarify what the requirements are in terms of um ap yeah sure as well as yeah sure so um if you're applying by the sass b route you can submit your application to the state of the relevant state or territory health department in the same application but if you're using the authorized prescriber pathway you'll need to apply directly to to the state or territory for approval from them in terms of the individual requirements the tjo can't comment on the requirements of individual states and territories so i'd recommend you um to get in touch with your relevant state of territory health department um in order to to clarify any of the requirements as to whether additional approval is required to to prescribe medicinal cannabis in your jurisdiction um it's the responsibility of the prescribing health practitioner to know the legislation of the of the jurisdiction in which they're operating great thanks petra we've had a pre-submitted question as well in regards to um using the paper form just wondering if you could clarify whether that paper form is still available okay um for prescribers um yeah great thanks for the question so um we will still accept paper um applications um but we are preferred but online submission of sas and authorized prescriber applications via the online system is preferred in order to reduce processing times so the paper forms are still available on the website for exceptional circumstances so for example where the medical practitioner is unable to use the online system and our staff will be providing education to prescribers who wish to use the paper form in regard to applying for an active ingredient category as opposed to a specific trade name thanks we've got an interesting question here in regards to prescribing under ap for pediatric patients and whether there is any steps that are different in the um sas online system for under 18s thanks that's a great question so um as you could as you saw from the indications that were included in the authorized prescriber established history of use list these are only for adult patients so if you wish to use any medicinal cannabis product for a pediatric patient you'll need to to become an authorized prescriber you'll need to gain ethics committee approval um or if you otherwise you could use the sas b pathway great thanks petra there's a few questions coming through about the ap scheme and whether um particular courses need to be done prior to applying no so any australian registered medical practitioner can apply to become an authorized prescriber and the application process is um exactly what i showed you just now um so these particular medicines for those specified dosage forms and those specified indications have been deemed to have established history of use by the tga and can be used without ethics committee approval if the product doesn't meet those those requirements exactly then you'll need to apply for ethics committee approval to become an authorized prescriber and depending on the hatred or ethics committee um they may require certain courses i'm not sure that's within the the remit of that particular ethics committee great thanks and on that topic petra someone's asked about the six monthly reporting for under ap and the requirements and why it's can why it's considered necessary um so because we're not um receiving applications on a per patient basis we do wish to still collect information about product you know the number of products that are being used in australia um so we require six months as a condition of the approval um we do require six monthly reports to be um to be provided and this is a requirement actually under a suburb sub-regulation 12 b of the therapeutic goods regulations so you're required authorized prescribers are required to submit to us every six months just the numbers of patients that were treated and that the information is fairly simple they're just raw numbers so for example you would say i started four new patients um on on on this medication during this this particular six month period and i continued to treat another another two so the total there is is six patients treated during that that six month period but we're just looking for whole numbers they were not after dates of birth or patient details or anything similar thanks patreon going back to a pre-submitted question how will quality requirements for importers be enforced with the new changes to the scheme sponsors of medicinal cannabis products continue to be legally responsible for ensuring that their products comply with the tg093 as well as other relevant orders tj93 isn't the only relevant order for example this tj100 which is the microbiological order um but then just no longer required to submit a tj93 declaration form to us and that's no different from many other orders we don't require a declaration form but the sponsor is legally obliged um to comply with these orders um and we do do compliance audits so for example our laboratories run targeted and random laboratory testing um and and that's to assess that the um the the the content um that's declared on the label of active ingredient is is the um is correct as per the state claims and we also have done tests for um toxins and impurities uh and of course failure comply with tj93 or any other order is subject to regulatory compliance action so that includes civil and criminal penalties under sections 14 of the act um there's also sponsors also have a six monthly reporting requirement so like authorized prescribers they must report to the tga the numbers of products that they used and under which pathway um every six months we've introduced a new form that's an existing requirement but we've introduced a new form to streamline that process for them and so we're expanding our compliance framework so despite removing the the declaration form um we're expanding um compliance measures so there's a question here about whether products are required to be manufactured in accordance with gmp so again this is something that was part of the public consultation that was held in january of this year um and changes are coming into place likely from march next year to require gmp um uh gmp for imported products currently gmp is required for australian domestic products but not for imported products and so these changes are being brought in to level the playing field and and require gmp for imported products and those changes are likely to be in place from march next year thank you there seems um to be a question in regards to the sas category c application pathway do you mind clarifying thank you sure so sas category c is a notification pathway um which is for products which have established history of use so it is similar in some ways to the authorized prescriber established history of useless um sassy is only available under our regulations for schedule four products um so we haven't included medicinal cannabis on any of this on the sas c list and so c notifications need to be provided on a per patient basis um whereas the authorized prescriber scheme as i've outlined um can you know someone can just become an authorized prescriber of a particular product and then use that that product prescribe that product as much as they like within the period of the approval so the authorized prescriber pathway is much more streamlined much uh much better for for medical practitioners in our view thanks petra there is a question here about writing an ap prescription prior to authority do you mind just clarifying sure so in australia products have to be included in aitg in order to be supplied in australia there are exemptions to this and authorized prescriber and sas are some of those exemptions so it's illegal to write a prescription for a product that you don't hold an ap or sas approval for um when i've got a question here when can we expect to see the published list of products within each category um so we're expecting that that list will be available on the website um hopefully today or or or tomorrow that we're just reviewing that list unfortunately for compliance with legislation um before we publish that so we are working on that as quickly as we can well i think that's all we have time for today i'm sorry that we weren't able to get through all of the questions but i think we did get through um the lion's share of them if we didn't answer your question or if you have any further questions please do feel free to contact us at medicinal.cannabis health.gov.edu and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon i know how busy prescriber prescribers and pharmacists are so i really appreciate you taking time out of your lunch break um all day to um to to to to to check in and learn about these important changes which hopefully will reduce administrative burden for prescribers thank you
POEj04JRCQU,Does DVA fund medical cannabis in Australia? | Ask Dr Mark ep. 9,2021-03-16T05:19:40Z,[Music] dva patients are seeking treatment with medicinal cannabis as alternatives to some of the more traditional treatments which may have been explored unsuccessfully in the past i often have treatment refractory conditions including chronic pain major depression post-traumatic stress disorder and a range of other conditions which may be approved by their rehabilitation provider currently dva approves chronic pain as an indication for medicinal cannabis and chronic pain only in order for a patient to access treatment under an authority or approval from dva it's important that a number of criteria be met for that to happen in the first instance a referral to the cannabis provider needs to be done by the patient's usual prescriber this should outline the treatment that the patient's undergone in the past and the reasons why treatment is currently unsuccessful it would be helpful if that referral also included a list of the patient's current and previous medical conditions the patient's medication list needs to be included as well preferably past as well as present medications so that the cannabis prescriber can get some scope of what's been trialled in the past and what's been successful and what has been less so from there an assessment is carried out by the cannabis prescriber which will encompass the patient's physical and mental health it's important if medicinal cannabis is prescribed that an understanding of the patient's previous use of substances and previous mental health conditions has been well documented and is provided to dva for their consideration patients that have unstable mental health or have had previous or current suicidal ideation would require special consideration those with current suicidal ideation would very likely be excluded from any sort of medicinal cannabis treatment until that was stabilized patients with conditions other than chronic pain seeking treatment with medicinal cannabis for that condition should be referred back to their referring doctor for clarification of the reason for referral because dva may not cover their condition no matter how well they feel that medicinal cannabis might benefit them once we've established that chronic pain is the indication and that medicinal cannabis would be beneficial the next step is to get an independent specialist opinion confirming that this is the case such as if you were using medicinal cannabis for a neurological condition where a neurologist would be asked to help or a pediatric condition where a pediatrician might be used to help in this case a pain specialist opinion is necessary for the provision of medicinal cannabis the pain specialist may in themselves then form the conclusion that a medicinal cannabis treatment may be of benefit for that condition this all needs to be documented and included with the cannabis clinicians assessment and sent on to dva for consideration and potential approval prior to sending such an application it is wise to also seek tga approval for the products that you propose to use for a dva patient the tga approval responses in writing should be included in the application along with your letter and the letter from the paid specialist the tga application for sass takes between two and five days and often when using a portal results can come back to you within 24 hours once all the information has been collected it is sent then to dva for consideration the timeline for dva to consider approve or reject such applications can vary from time to time based on their resources at the time and the information that we provide to them so it's important if you want these products to be used in your patients and for approvals to flow as smoothly as possible to include as much information as you possibly can in the initial application to dva you
iiCoq6w8XQc,Side effects from Medical Cannabis,2021-01-20T10:31:14Z,in the most part cannabis-based medicines are very well tolerated side effects if they're experienced tend to be short-lived and resolved by themselves common side effects include constipation diarrhea headache nausea and sedation more concerning side effects like psychotic symptoms are more likely to be experienced by those that are predisposed to those symptoms as part of our screening process we ensure that patients that do have a predisposition are monitored more closely or excluded from treatment we would also exclude treatment to patients that have unstable cardiac conditions because it's known that cannabis can increase heart rate and cause palpitations
PMkBrL8dNgA,Australian CBD review | Good for anxiety?,2021-03-11T17:00:12Z,these last few weeks i've been trying cbd for the very first time in this video i share my experience and why i think these are a game changer hey guys thanks for checking out the channel my name is nick slater and cbd is definitely a buzzy wellness product at the moment with athletes celebrities doctors all endorsing the product i've even seen coffee with cbd cbd latte even beauty companies are releasing products with hemp oil in their formula cbd is everywhere and it's growing with a projected market of 22 billion dollars in 2022. so what is it cbd is short for cannabidiol found naturally in cannabis it's non-psychoactive so it won't get you high and it's used in products like oils and edibles to help people feel relaxed and calm it's claimed to have an abundance of health benefits from helping with anxiety to sleep mood muscle soreness and recovery without any hangover or side effects cbd almost sounded too good to be true and i was determined to get my hands on some but i wanted to make sure that whatever i chose was legit it had been properly tested so that i knew exactly what was in their formula my body's a temple so i came across this brand pure leafs on instagram and could see that all of their products were lab tested vegan friendly and organic so that was a massive tick for me they were kind enough to send me a bunch of products and have given me a referral link which you'll find below i've been really surprised by the products but first the taste i feel like i'm doing show and tell so i've been trying their oil full spectrum cbd gummies and hemp gummies the gummies are definitely my preference because they taste like gummy bears they're delicious it just makes the delivery of the cbd kind of like a treat the oil you put under your tongue for 60 to 90 seconds without swallowing which can be a bit of a challenge but the taste is completely fine it's a little bit strange but it's very subtle i've tried taking the different products at different times and have had similar effects from all of them so i guess choosing one comes down to your personal preference on taste if you're like me a child i'd go for the gummy bears now this is why i think these are a game changer so my cbd journey began one morning i was fairly stressed with work i had a content deadline and i was a little bit wound up i had to sit down and bang out a couple of hours work so i took two gummies hoping that they might relax me and calm me down for work it took about 10 minutes to feel something i started feeling more comfortable and relaxed it was like that overactive part of my mind which was stressing me out had slowed down and quietened like i was able to drop out of my head a bit and get into my body it was sort of a new sensation because i felt like i was getting the relaxation you get after a glass of wine or a sleeping tablet but without the fatigue it definitely took the edge off my stress and helped me focus on work i didn't feel as compelled to check my phone and i felt in flow i was pleasantly surprised about how effective the gummies were while working the next time i put the cbd to the test was after dinner and before bed i wanted something to relax me and calm my mind before going to sleep this time i put the oil under my tongue and again about 10 minutes later i started feeling the effects relaxation calmness almost a sense of being stoned without the loss of clarity i was watching netflix with my girlfriend and it knocked her out she fell asleep it made me sleepy as well but i think i enjoyed it more as a relaxer again it had the benefits of a glass of wine without the side effects another tick from me verdict they work better than i thought they would in a work setting they are great for taking the edge off stress and i genuinely think they helped me get into flow with work and it's really helpful getting ready for bed as well it's a great way to relax and generally just puts me in a comfortable happy place it's almost too good to be true because you expect a hangover or side effects but it's completely natural and organic the reason i think these are a game changer is because they're perfect for anyone wanting that calming effect after a big day of work without going down the alcohol weed or prescription meds room they have no addictive properties and no dependency potential for those reasons i think they're a great product and i have no hesitation taking these or recommending them to people looking for a natural way to help with their stress or anxiety issues guys thank you for sticking around i hope you got something out of the video are you on the cbd bandwagon if so let me know in the comments below i always love hearing from you hit the subscribe button and until next week peace
HpSM6vxNw04,Medicinal cannabis oil found effective for treating autism,2021-12-19T09:14:33Z,the importance of our studies is that we show for the first time that cannabis oil is very effective in sub-population of autism we found the mechanism and we we believe that cannabis oil or substances from this family will be used safely in autism we tested two main substances in the cannabis the first one is thc and the second one is cbd we started with medical cannabis oils which are enriched with cbd because this is what common these days for tremendous for treatment of autism in the clinic we saw positive results however when we tested medical cannabis oils that does not contain cbd in it and have only thc we saw even better results moreover when you tested cbd alone we didn't saw any effects on the behavior of course this is an initial study and there is much more need for basic and clinical trials in the future but we do hope that throughout this basic research we will be able to assist physicians in the clinic
I7mrVER4XIQ,3 STEPS to LEGALLY access medicinal cannabis in Australia (2021),2021-09-12T22:13:55Z,medicinal cannabis has been legal at the federal level in australia since 2016. however many australians still can't access the medicine due to lack of information after months of research and actually experiencing the access journey this is how to access medicinal cannabis in australia step one start with your general practitioner simply ask for medical cannabis if they're not comfortable prescribing it you can then ask for your health summary and a referral letter step two find a doctor you have two options an authorized prescriber or an online cannabis access clinic an authorised prescriber is able to give you the required script instantly without delay an authorized prescriber near you can be found using dot canonreviewsau.com alternatively you can use the obtained documents in step one and do everything online with a cannabis access clinic such as cda or tetrahealth step 3 find a dispensary if you have a paper script simply take the script to a recommended pharmacy they will then order your medicine and dispense it within two days a dispensary fee may apply if you went with a cannabis access clinic they will ship your medicine straight to your door therapeutic products work differently on everyone and there are a lot of products to browse and determine what's right for you and your budget this is obviously a really expensive process don't hesitate to ask your doctor for more options as they are likely just as new to this as you are
xL-XwqB6CxE,Why the City of Maribyrnong wants to sell medicinal marijuana   | 7NEWS,2021-09-14T08:39:04Z,
8bSSL6zxZuw,The leading source on the medicinal cannabis industry in Australia,2021-06-18T09:52:56Z,thanks tim uh so as tim mentioned i'm the managing director of fresh leaf analytics our work in the industry encompasses detailed market intelligence reports custom research market analysis and of course strategy development for the medicinal cannabis industry we work with medicinal cannabis companies pharmaceutical and consumer goods organizations government and we also work with companies who are looking to assess investment opportunities in the market moving on to the next slide twice a year fresh leaf analytics releases a free industry report on the state of the medicinal cannabis industry in australia and today i'm going to share with you some of the key highlights from our most recent report which is our first half report for 2021 it contains data on patient product and pricing in the industry and that data is derived from proprietary fresh leaf models data from the therapeutic goods administration from product companies and also from anonymized real world patient data for those of you who are wanting to read the report in detail it is available on our website which is fresh leaf analytics dot com dot a u so we'll get into it i'm pleased to say that the medicinal cannabis industry continues to experience very robust market growth product revenue in 2020 closed at just over 100 million and that was up from 30 million in the previous year so really it's significant growth year on year we closed 2020 with around 30 000 active patients and so they're patients who have filled a prescription or seen a doctor for medicinal cannabis in the past month now this is a significant jump up from 2019 where the year ended with 10 000 active patients now turning our focus to 2021 there are currently around 55 000 active patients in the market and we're estimating that we'll finish the year at between 75 to 85 000 active patients now it's worth noting that at the start of 2019 there were just 3 000 active patients so we've seen a growth factor of over 15 times in just two years in terms of product revenue we are expecting that 2021 will bring a milestone for us and that we'll see over 200 million in our product revenue by the end of this year and in fact year to date sales have already well surpassed the total year sales for 2019. now in terms of our indicators of market growth for those of you who aren't familiar with the industry uh moving on to the next slide the two key indicators to keep an eye on are what we call sass b and authorized prescriber and both of these uh indicators have hit record numbers in 2021. now sas b represents the number of per patient approvals for prescriptions in australia while authorized prescriber represents the number of doctors who are who have authorization to prescribe medicinal cannabis products without needing to get a per patient approval so we've seen starting with sassafee we've seen some volatility in the sass b numbers this year and we've seen two very big spikes one in march and and one in may and both of those months we hit almost 10 000 approvals to put that number into context for you the previous 12 month average was 5 000 approvals per month so they were really significant spikes now there's a couple of factors that are driving the volatility that you can see in the graph that's on the left hand side of the page some of these are signaling what we believe is genuine underlying market growth while there are some others that have artificially raised approvals so for example there was a flower shortage that the industry experienced earlier this year which required doctors to submit a number of approvals for a single patient or a single prescription and so industry observers are going to be watching that sas b number very very closely over the couple next couple of months to see where it settles and to see what it tells us about the true growth trajectory of the industry now looking at the number of authorized prescribers this is a really fascinating and significant story you can see that the number of authorised prescribers was low and stagnant for quite a long period of time but recently this has started to gain momentum so we hit 263 authorized prescribers in may that's up from 179 from in december and just 29 authorized prescribers in the year prior to that so december 2019 and the reason that it's a really important metric for the industry is because authorized prescribers typically prescribe in very high volumes and in fact we estimate that they now prescribe medicinal cannabis for around one in five patients so while the sassy or special access pathway remains a primary channel for patients who are seeking access to medicinal cannabis the authorized prescriber pathway is going to be a significant contributor for future growth and future patient numbers now moving on to the next slide this slide shows the number of products that are available in australia for doctors to choose from to prescribe for patients and australia has become a highly commoditized market they are now around 190 products on the market for doctors to choose from and the products keep company coming so what you'll see from the graph here is that the number of products available has roughly doubled each year since 2018. it's really difficult to think of an industry that has so many companies that are vying for what a piece of what is still a relatively small although be it fast growing pie in terms of product formats the growth has primarily come from oil although we did see some modest growth from the number of flower products obviously prior to um to the flower shortage together oil and flower comprise over 80 of the products that are available and so they very much still do dominate the industry they're traditional formats that dominate the industry still today now while the number of products available is fantastic for doctor and and patient choice it also comes with great challenges because the industry is highly commoditized it's difficult for physicians to differentiate between products beyond price and formulation and so meaningful different differentiation in the product space but also in customer experience more broadly remains an issue for the industry as you can imagine uh moving on to the next slide you can see that in environment of intense competition and record product numbers the price is continuing to drop and we've seen steady price declines over the last couple of years 2021 has bought a substantial drop in the retail floor price for the cheapest product on the market from a retail price perspective and it's now three cents per milligram of cannabinoid now this is half of what the floor price was uh towards the end of 2020 where it was six cents per milligram so we can see that the price is dropping very quickly i do want to point out though that just because there are cheap cheaper products available on the market it doesn't mean that patients are being prescribed those products or that those products are yet widely available and at the moment only around one in five products on the market has a retail floor price that sits below that 10 cents per milligram mark and we have freshly have anecdotally heard reports that there are a number of low priced products in the market that are failing to gain traction and the same thing is happening with delivery format innovation where new delivery formats have not yet reached critical mass so simply push just putting a cheap product in the market or a new delivery form at the market is not a guarantee for success and there's a variety of reasons for this so doctors may be concerned about quality of the products or about efficacy many doctors do stick with their tried and tested particularly with new delivery formats where they often ask for a higher they have a higher asking price so doctors if they're not familiar with them feel that that might be a bit more of a risk particularly in an industry where patients aren't you know paying quite a lot of money for the medication uh organizations company players might or industry players might have budgets that restrict things like doctor education and engagement so as you can imagine doctors busy people having to stay abreast of 190 different products and keep track of what's coming into the market is no easy task for them and outside of that we might see with delivery formats they don't allow the kind of flexibility that doctors are used to having with products like oil so all of this contributes to patients feeling that the products in the market are still too expensive and we do expect that we'll see the average price of products continue to drop as well as that floor price in the future now on to patient spend so patients at the moment are spending on average 359 dollars a month and you can see here that really that patient spend has remained relatively flat over the past three years in terms of the average daily dose patients are taking about 87 milligrams a day of their medication and over three quarters of patients are actually on a dose that's less than 100 milligrams a day and moving on to the next slide this is an important statistic to take note of in terms of where the market is at the moment and the reason for that is that the tga down scheduled low-dose cbd from schedule four where it's prescription only to schedule three where you can go into a pharmacy talk to the pharmacist and and get a low dose cbd product over the counter although i will point out that there are no products yet on the market uh companies are have plans underway for doing the clinical research that's required to demonstrate quality safety and efficacy and to get those applications into the tga for registration on the artg almost a quarter of medicinal cannabis patients are currently taking a low-dose cbd product they're spending about eight dollars a day and we're expecting that that patient cohort will migrate to the pharmacy channel once lojo's cbd products become available so that's over sort of 10 000 patients who are currently spending about 30 million a year and so our belief is that the the companies who are able to to be the first to get to the s3 market will be the ones that take the line share of that group because people will naturally be reluctant to go to a doctor and get a prescription for a product that they can easily access over the counter in pharmacies and interestingly within the industry we have begun to see a sort of evidence of shuffling in low-dose cbd products as the market readies itself and that's taken the form of companies entering the industry as well as as uh products and manufacturers or choosing to exit the industry and the their reasons for that could be that they have products at the moment that sit in that s3 profile but aren't uh suitable for s3 they might not have the right delivery format for example they might not meet the manufacturing requirements for registering a product and so companies may be choosing not to invest in further clinical research required to demonstrate the sort of efficacy of these products where there's concerns about whether the maximum daily dose of 150 milligrams a day will in fact be effective so we'll expect to see that some of these companies will shift their focus elsewhere and uh and may introduce either more suitable s3 should schedule three formulations or move away from low-dose cbd altogether and to wrap up in terms of what we see lies ahead for the industry we are expecting further industry consolidation as a result of price decreases and companies whose business models may not have built those price decreases uh into consideration when they set their operations up a few years ago we're expecting changes in the regulatory landscape as well as the product and pricing landscape and i can see that my time is up tim so i'm going to wind it up there and uh and leave it for questions later thanks thanks andrew we do have some questions um in terms of being an authorised prescriber what what does a doctor have to be an authorised prescriber if they're prescribing authorized products and it seems to be a an additional life of regulatory overkill if you like so the authorized prescriber channel was set up for doctors who want to do or are doing high volumes of prescriptions at the moment the the products are unregistered and so uh the sass b system was put in place for the individual patient approvals which means that tga can keep a pretty close eye on uh what products are getting approved for which type of patients and for what sort of indications um so so really that will remain a primary pathway until we get to a point where there are there's more gps or more specialists who are prescribing high volumes and this question here how ask prescribers determining the dosage of cannabis products needed so that will come down to their clinical assessment and the patient's condition and what they believe is required typically doctors use what's called a start low so start logo slow and so they'll go for a lower dosage and then titrate up depending on how a patient is responding to their medication and what are they prescribing products for is it for sleep apnea and all those sort of things so primarily for pain we see uh certainly a lot of patients coming through for different types of pain patients are also looking at stress and anxiety um of course there's uh epilepsy rare forms of childhood epilepsy epidialex is a product that has been registered on a rtg and it's approved for that we have statistics which is also registered which is for multiple sclerosis so so they're the sorts of indications that we're seeing patients prescribe medicinal cannabis for and and where is australia in this kind of global landscape where are we positioned in terms of our development in this space so australia is quite a unique market in that we've taken a pharmaceutical approach to medicinal cannabis we are highly regulated we are very focused on getting quality and products to patients that will be effective we are different to places like uh canada and the us for example where you might be able to you know sort of access cbd products much more readily but i believe we've taken a much more sort of medically and more patient sort of centered approach and more responsible approach in australia than elsewhere and and where's big pharma positions in this obviously we've got some companies presenting in a moment is is this a space big pharma or renting into globally so we haven't seen a lot of overt evidence yet of big pharma although we are seeing uh some movements in the market so you may have heard about the recent acquisition of gw farmer by jazz pharmaceuticals that was for 7.2 billion gw pharma are the companies that uh registered and and manufactured epidialex and sativex and so with that sort of transaction and uh and also obviously that the market um potential we are we are expecting that big pharma will come on board um in in the future but not in such a big way just yet

5NEjTfqEb1k,Medical Cannabis &amp; IBS Clinical Trial Recruiting - Explained by Professor Alistair Vickery (Emyria),2021-02-14T23:03:48Z,hey everyone tom brown co-founder of honole here and today i'm with alastair vickery the medical director of ameria clinics alistair is going to speak with us about the ibs and medical cannabis clinical trial that ameria is running and how patients can get involved so thanks for joining me today alistair thanks for having me um so we'll jump straight into it so can you tell us who exactly is running the ibs trial and medical cannabis study so emmeria is um supporting this trial so myria is a health data technology company collecting data to try and see the effectiveness of medications and we're essentially looking at whether medicinal cannabis helps to reduce the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome okay great and so what exactly do you hope to achieve with this study in particular well there have been lots and lots of reports from people taking medicinal cannabis and recreational cannabis showing that symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome abdominal pain bloating constipation diarrhea are relieved when people are taking medicinal cannabis and there have not been any high quality studies looking at specific doses or specific formulations of either cbd cannabidiol or thc tetrahydrocannabinol or whether combinations of those work best and so what we're trying to work out is what works for whom and when right and so tell us a little bit more about why this trial is so important for patients and australians well and people i think for the whole of the world i think that ibs is very very common about 15 of australians suffer from symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and there aren't very many treatments available that are affected the most effective treatment been shown and with good quality research is the fodmap diet which is a diet low in some of the saccharides that cause inflammation of the gut but it's a very strict diet and very difficult to adhere to and many people uh struggle to adhere to it easily because the the saccharides are hidden in lots of other foods and we've had lots of anecdotes about people taking medicinal cannabis and getting really good response and so what we're trying to find out is whether it works or not and we need a high quality trial with you know with good quality medicinal cannabis where we know what dose of cbd or thc is being taken and what effect it has all right that makes sense so how will the clinical trial work so most of this will most of the patient data will be collected online so people will be sent questionnaires that they'll fill in once a week short questionnaires and once a month they'll be sent much more detailed questionnaires they'll be monitored in a clinic so we have multiple clinics around australia so the emerald clinics which will collect those data and prescribe the medicinal cannabis and it will be about finding what combination of cbd whether cbd alone works or whether thc in combination works and to try and find out whether we can relieve some of the symptoms for people who have ibs great great so can you tell us who can take part in the clinical trial and if there are any specific requirements for those patients yeah anyone with a diagnosis of ibs so they would need a medical diagnosis they need a referral from their doctor either you know the gastroenterologist or their gp saying that they're giving the history of their ibs and the exclusions um if they have inflammatory bowel disease crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis they're excluded or if you have active cancer or you're pregnant um you're excluded as well but anyone over the age of 18 with at least three months of uh irritable bowel syndrome um is can be included on the trial okay great and you mentioned something earlier about being cannabis naive yeah um because we want to know what works and in whom [Music] patients need to be that need to not have any cannabinoids in their system so if you're taking regular cannabis either recreationally or from other any other source then you'd have to stop that at least four weeks before beginning the trial okay great thanks for clarifying so just to wrap it up is there anything else patients should know before trying to get involved with this clinical trial well this is a a private trial so people will have to pay for the consultations and for the product um but the collection of data is being funded by miriam okay great so can you just tell us what the out-of-pocket costs for patients will be yeah um after a referral to emerald clinics it'll cost about a thousand dollars that's for the cost of the medication and the cost of the consultation out of pocket for six months that depends of course on the dose that you require so it could be as little as six hundred dollars or it could be as much as twelve hundred dollars depending because as you know medicinal cannabis is still not funded by the pbs and studies like these will help to push that forward the only other interesting thing i know you've discussed this tom many occasions is the problem with thc and driving that if you're taking a thc product in australia currently you're prohibited from uh because it's detectable in the bloodstream okay great yeah thank you thank you for clarifying that for people as well um it is it is a challenging situation but hopefully we'll see some of those laws change that we'll have a more sensible legislation very shortly absolutely all right perfect well thanks for that alistair i don't have any more questions about the clinical trial so we'll wrap it up and i look forward to having you back thanks very much tom

1gfOLnFCAeM,420 Seconds on medicinal CANNABIS QUALITY in Australia,2021-12-06T02:14:38Z,[Music] hi i'm neil i'm dave and we're here to answer your most frequently asked cannabis questions we'll be doing this through a series of quick digestible q a's with some of the most important characters in the cannabis industry and the broader culture at large today we're spending 420 seconds with danny minogue danny once had a long career in various sales and marketing roles with a little-known pharmaceutical company called astrazeneca after a routine company restructure danny decided to take his skills transition to greener pastures and follow his passion into the newly legalized medical cannabis market he started with our thea group holdings in 2018 and held a number of sales roles including working with prescribers and helping to educate doctors to establish medical cannabis advocates within the medical community more recently he's taken up a role heading up business development at can group who are an australian gmp cultivator and manufacturer can group currently manufacture gnp medical cannabis for the local and international markets danny is passionate about breaking down stigma associated with cannabis and celebrates the local cannabis industry bringing gnp medicines to patients danny thanks for your time hi lads how are we very well thanks man so mate for uh for better or worse australia is obviously very regulated how does that translate to the quality of product uh consumer can expect from medicinal cannabis in australia versus the rest of the world a good question dave so all of the australian manufacturers need to release this product to a pharmaceutical standard that would be referred to as gmp or good manufacturing practices so it's a set of principles that defines um the manufacture of of all pharmaceuticals essentially around the world um so it's it's a high standard it's something that gives you know doctors and patients a high level of reassurance what's a bit unusual with medicinal cannabis is the tj have allowed non-gmp products to be imported from overseas into the country now early on mate that was done to allow for supply the local industry wasn't at a point where they could support the volumes needed for patient so i think there was a period where it was done through necessity but it's it's basically meant that a lower standard or a lower quality of medicinal cannabis product is allowed into the australian marketplace interesting so in terms of like from a patient perspective danny and a product perspective what can patients expect with gmp quality so i i i think the comparison um there neil sorry is that it's a pharmaceutical standard so there's this they can be assured that there is some consistency from batches there is quality assurance there is training through the personnel involved in the manufacture and and that's replicated from facility to facility so i think patients that are getting gnp quality medicine have a high level of comfort a high level of security and they know that they are getting a very regulated high quality product i think without those standards in place means some quality aspects have the potential to slip the products that are coming in that are non-gmp still need to comply to some standards um and locally they've been referred to as tj93 tgo 100 standards so there's testing on pesticides and heavy metals and a whole range of other tests still need to be done but it isn't quite to the same standards and and level that gmp works too right so with the uh the recent announcement from the tga it seems apparently come 2022 all products will be gmp which is great from a patient's perspective so they get that high quality product with that said there still is pricing all over the place um for one reason or another and i guess the question is should patients think that pricing is indicative of quality or is there other factors at play i like i i think it's it's a fair statement to say to to work to gmp standards is a more expensive proposition so i don't think there's any doubt there that that's not the cheapest way to do things but as we spoke about earlier you know the need for reliability the need for consistency and for patient confidence is really high i think as you know the australian market starting to really get some momentum so there are a number of manufacturers operating in the australian market and are starting to do so at significant scale so whilst some companies may find challenges and their products are costing them more i think the fact that the local in particular the local market has got um plenty of capacity to supply demand uh should mean that patients um still receiving you know the products at a similar price um and and hopefully with the increased competition that price continues to get pushed down interesting and so from a patient's perspective again should they when they're talking to their doctors about products should they be considering any of these these items in their discussions at all probably today it's not a bad idea neil you know i think once the tga bring this into effect once this becomes mandated that problem goes out the window for both prescribers and and patients so i think at the moment there is a a market where there are differing standards of products available that may or may not be differentiated by price some of them are just as expensive as gnp others are a bit cheaper and perhaps prescribers and patients are being attracted to them because they are a cheaper entry point um so i look i think patients should be aware that there are differences between the products and i think it's reasonable for them to be saying that they would like a product that's manufactured in a pharmaceutical way um no agree agree so i guess um what's quite exciting is obviously the quality stanzas are there and getting better uh prices as the market grow are coming down uh rivaling if not beating street prices uh to a degree now which is great and i think there's some excitement around the corner those two factors and of course locally grown is one we are we fully support so those three factors aside is there anything else patients should be considering when it comes to flower choice when talking to their doctor i think there is i think you know a lot of doctors will take a holistic approach to patients treatment so whilst flower definitely has a role to play you know i i think there can be a place for the oils to complement patients flowers so i think it's really important they share that patients share their experience what we know about cannabis is it needs to be individualized so what works for one person may not work from the other so flour we certainly know that has the potential to cause sedative like effects so if patients defining that's problematic for them during the day then i think they should share that with their doctor you know if they're liking flour as a way of taking their medicine there are different options that may you know not cause that sedation um there's different flowers that are available that might be better suited to daytime use or nighttime use so the at the end of the day you know there's no one right approach for everyone so people need to accept that and i think they explore that with their doctors that if they're finding their sleeping grade the daytime's a problem once they share those symptoms back with your doctor they're finding the other way around again therapies can be tailored and um some of the changes recently with the tga allow for those tweaks and those adaptions in a much easier cheaper and quicker fashion than what was 12 months ago and doctors had to do more paperwork and let's be honest was a pain in the ass for everyone um that's now been made simpler so i think you know um patience uh perhaps being put you know at the forefront of therapy which is important danny danny that's some really insightful information thanks for your time [Music] you
68XN9q6Ni4U,19 May 21: Dr Ian Thong &amp; Anthony Hall: Medicinal cannabis - The evidence,2021-05-19T04:02:58Z,series um i'm joining you from brisbane nyanjin and today's webinar is medicinal cannabis the evidence name is michelle taylor i'm one of the clinical educators here at inside [Applause] and today we're joined by dr ian song a neuroscientist and pain medicine specialist from the gold coast university hospital and also by anthony hall senior clinical pharmacist at the gold coast hospital persistent pain service so i'd like to begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land on which this event takes place here that's the turbo and the agro peoples and i'd like to acknowledge the traditional owners of all those places that you are joining us from here today i'd like to pay respects to elders past present and emerging and also to pay that same respect to all of those aboriginal and torres strait islander peoples joining us here today so without further ado i know there's great interest in today's topic so i will be handing over to our two presenters and joining you later on uh please put your questions in the chat we'll be monitoring those and we will have some time at the end to respond to them so good morning and thank you for joining me and the opportunity to speak to you on the current evidence for medicinal cannabis medicinal cannabis was approved to be prescribed by the and legalized by the australian government in 2016. this graph shows the trend in tga approvals between june 2018 and may 2019 and the current number of applications and approvals is about 3 000 per month this is not unsimilar to the data we see overseas the current and actual number of new approvals is not clear right at this moment some of the applications are renewals to continue on with medicinal cannabis either way it is a significant number why are there so many because medicinal cannabis is being promoted as the new wonder drug and the answer to many health problems and considered healthy because it's a herb let me start with a summary of the evidence in case you fall asleep or have to go off in general terms the evidence doesn't support medicinal cannabis for chronic non-cancer pain and many other conditions some would argue there is evidence for neuropathic pain but this is weak to moderate the evidence for cancer pain is even more unclear again weak to moderate what we see is reported benefits for some of the other symptoms related to cancer there is however moderate to strong evidence for certain conditions and we'll discuss them in a moment this is not just an opinion as you can see this evidence is has been analyzed by research and medical bodies government agencies and they all in principle agree the evidence for pain is limited and there is insufficient evidence to recommend cannabis for chronic pain they also agree more quality research is required so let's talk about the positive evidence and let me point out that these are predominantly not pain symptoms drab syndrome is severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and we've certainly seen the press around this and it is and it is refractory to usual epileptic medications de vinsky and other studies showed reduced seizures and convulsive seizure frequency in children between two and 18 years and five percent of the children in the trial were actually see seizure-free the quality of this research is strong and as such the government has previous listed epidemiolex which is a cbd thc product rice in 2018 analyzed two high-quality systematic reviews and their evidence suggested medical cannabis reduced the symptoms of patient-reported spasticity and ms however their analysis did not find the same for other neurological conditions grimsil is is a current grim syndicate is involved in a current australian clinical trial and they've just completed phase two of the study they've shown that medicinal cannabis which is cbd and thc together as an adjuvant with other antibiotics reduces chemotherapy nausea and vomiting and this study because of its positive outcomes is preceding the phase three trial the national the australian national prescribing services looked at the evidence as well they found moderate to strong evidence supporting medicinal cannabis for hiv-related wasting but weak to moderate evidence for certain pain conditions and it and if anything it might help in multiple sclerosis tourettes and motor neurone disease they also concluded the evidence for other pain conditions is limited and insufficient to make to support recommendations in fact one of my colleagues has just published a paper in the medical journal of australia and that showed they said based on their research study research work that medicinal cannabis should not be prescribed for chronic back pain what about medicinal cannabis to reduce opioid use based on animal studies medicinal cabinets could be useful reducing opiate requirements after operations and after surgery some say it could even replace opioids babylonis and wash in 2020 presented evidence from animal studies they reported that thc reduced erp requirements in acute pain however this didn't correlate with human studies where patients reported preference to thc but opiates were better for analgesia an important finding from the study was that thc increased opiate risk of abuse rima natal in 2017 was an observational study in the us they interviewed a number of patients and based on that those interviews they reported that patients felt that cannabis was more effective than opioids and preferred however it wasn't qualified with the what exactly the patients meant by more effective and for what conditions they might mean when they when they say the preferred cannabis it might be reference to relative perceived safety so and social acceptability now in our pain clinic many of our patients report less anxiety muscle relief better sleep but not less pain now um yes now so what about medicinal cannabis for describing opioids the tuber proposed medicinal cannabis a way to reduce opioid use the study did not show medicinal cannabis reduced opioid use they did show a slower rate of increase of opioid overdose deaths that is to say it took longer to get to the same endpoint and they did see that they found that in the us this was more obvious in legalized legalized states in australia campbell this is again a member of the national drug and alcohol research center completed a comprehensive review of the literature could i find evidence that cannabis was useful for tapering or stopping opioids in this pain clinic we did not see a link between medicinal cannabis and opioid reduction what we do see is patients reduce opioid doses with education and support from the multi-disciplinary pain management team let me put my addiction my addiction hat on just for a moment as i consult i always ask the question is the patient substituting one drug for another this is common amongst clients with substance dependence they often tell me how well they are going they will say i have stopped using cocaine however on further questioning they've often started another drug or increased the use of a current one so physicians live by the motto do no harm so with the specific conditions just described if there is so little evidence of body business on cannabis are we actually causing harm supporting its use let's talk about this possible harm tolerance dependence of withdrawal and abstinence is well documented chronic users develop tolerance toward thc and require more for the same effect and they also report withdrawal symptoms when they stop using it it is not uncommon to see clients progress from one drug to another recreational cannabis is often the first drug on a perilous journey to other drugs we know about psychosis and new users and cognitive parents are commonly seen in chronic uses and it may be subtle at times but it's often there then there's the obvious harm in smoking cannabis as smoking and smoking related diseases the developing brain is important in terms of drug exposure and the developing brain is sensitive to drugs and studies report cannabis harmful to the developing brain power in 2020 performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal data of youths using canvas regularly and they found a reduction in iq in a swedish study back in 1989 of 45 000 male military compulsory conscripts it was found that higher chronic cannabis use was an independent risk factor for schizophrenia so let's put this in in the context of a real case scenario this is an 18 year old woman with chronic neck pain seen at the pain clinic the history includes breast reduction surgery for back pain botox for migraines excessive use of over-the-counter anti-inflammatories and paracetamol overuse of codeine using father's medication which was 45 milligrams of oromorphin equivalent and she'd already obtained cbd cannabis age in when she was 17 again for the neck pain and had already made the decision at last at the last consult that she was going to start cbd thc product when i examined her all i found was muscular pain nothing else she was asked she was asked to take less medications and the reply was if i shouldn't take neurophone and panadol should i take more codeine this is an evolving substance dependence disorder and the prescribed cannabis is adding to the problem so medicinal cannabis many say cannabis is good for easing anxiety promoting relaxation reducing muscle tension sedation and sleep but what else could you use what about meditation same effect cheaper a lot less harm so humans are funny beasts and mark gustin said human beings invent just as many ways to sabotage their lives as to improve them and we see that in medicine all the time if there is so little evidence supporting general use of medicinal cannabis and potential harm what are we doing to make it easily of why what are we doing making it easily available and another big question is should we actually support over-the-counter cbd anyway let me finish with this it is legal to prescribe medicinal cannabis in australia there are only a few conditions where it has proven benefit yet it's been prescribed for many different conditions despite the lack of evidence human beings are human beings and always looking for the holy grail but is it really cannabis i know we all know that good quality research is required to change the situation in the space i'll put this question to you if you know a patient client or friend using it have they been provided with all the information have they probably weighed up the risk and benefit are we making it too easily available and actually causing harm thank you i will now hand you over to my pharmacist colleague good morning i can't see you but that's annoying um i've been asked to talk about medicinal cannabis itself and so i thought let's do a general title of cannabis and persistent pain so first of all what is cannabis well cannabis is a product from the leaf and flowering plants of three species of cannabis cannabis sativa cannabis indica and cannabis rudoralis here's a nice picture of the of the cannabis plant um you can usually see just on the very center of the the the plant is the flower and you can see that that's all the hairy area and cannabis is otherwise known as marijuana it's also known as hemp it's called pot and it's called weed and there's lots of other different names within the cannabis plant itself there are over 70 between 70 and 100 now pharmacologically active compounds have been identified plus another 400 compounds which are related just to herbal substances the most important ones of those which we need to be aware about are that it contains delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol or thc it contains cannabidiol or cbd it also contains other ones like cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabirin thcv and there's also calabrian as well which is lots and lots of different chemicals each of them is known to have some pharmacological activity and that adds to the complexity of what with what we're talking about the picture in front of you is actually of cannabis uh sativa cannabis indica has got longer thinner leaves and cannabis ruderalis has got red colored leaves so pharmacologically uh within the brain within our brain we have been able to identify two areas on the surface of cells which interact with the natural ligands as we call the endogenous ligands which are cannabis which are called endocannabinoids and we have two of them in the human body we have a substance called anandamide and we also have two arachidol glycerol or two aeg as it's called in in shortened terms both of these are derived from the photic from fatty acids and it's derived initially from less desert in unless the thing if you think about it is the material that is composed of the of the cell wall within the body so we have similar to opioids where we have endorphins and in keflam in the body we have two chemicals that work on receptors in the brain which have been identified as also being associated with cannabinoids these are cb1 cb2 the cb ram receptors are found widely within the brain in the hippocampus in the cortex in the basal ganglia the cerebellum in the spinal cord in particularly in the dorsal ganglion of the spinal cord and also found now in peripheral nerves including presynaptics and sympathetic nerves they seem to be absent from the thalamus and the brain stem however so that would suggest the brain stem is the most primitive part of the of the brain so it may be something we have acquired as we developed as human beings cb2 receptors are found mainly in the periphery and they're found mainly associated with lymphatic tissue which is in that's it that means it's part of the immune system and there are also low concentrations of cb2 receptors and found in some of the brain regions including something called the periactic and periaqueductal gray which is a primary center for descending pain modulation so and they're also found uh on the glial cells in the spinal cord the glial cells form the material if you like in which the nerves within the spinal cord are are distributed that in other words they form glial cells form the bulk of the spinal cord and they are responsible for the immune modulation of spinal cord tissue so these things seem to be associated with the immune system in particular so here's where they're found so they're found quite widely within the spinal within the the brain this is just the cb1 receptors found widely within the brain and what i've tried to do here is that they have multiple or they have the capacity to interact in multiple ways within the within the nervous tissue so they they can be used for instance they can be have a role in reward in other words for addiction uh in the the which are usually dopaminergic in nature but it's clever associated with them they have a role in motor coordination and control they have a an activity in terms of memory and learning and that's when one of the major problems we have within immature um the immature brain because if we're smoking heavily during uh early during childhood this can inhibit the memory in the learning capacity so many of these children often do less well at school and they're spending more time smoking dope at home than going to school they also have a role in bloody body temperature in feeding and neuroendocrine function in anxiety and stress management in the regulations of voluntary movements and and movement in other areas in also types of learning as well as the decision-making cognition and emotional behavior of the human brain so wide activity within the brain the receptors of cells are activated through what we call g-coupled proteins in other words the the medicine sits on the surface of the cell the g-membrane proteins can produce responses within the cell producing the pharmacological effects and they produce physiological responses including feelings of well-being euphoria psychosis but also can impair memory and cognitive processing it slows motor function plus has potentially some antinocioceptive activity but also has some anti-antioxidant and also some sleep that promoting effects depending upon the dose of thc that is being delivered it's interesting to think now that paracetamol we've been wondering how paracetamol works as an analgesic and also as an antipyretic and it's thought that one of the metabolic breakdown products produced by the liver happens to mimic the effects of anandamide on cb1 receptors so is this breakdown product which is a potential vanilla cation channel what we call trip v1 receptor agonist is it actually working as an analgesic and as an antipyretic through similar effects to anandamide and we talked about anandamide being responsible for for instance temperature regulation and potentially for other effects within the brain shahid did a study the big study in 2021 and most of you would have seen the outcomes of that study on the news in recent time in the last month where the research suggests that the analgesic effects of paracetamol are possibly only perhaps at most about 20 of um reduction in pain and that's probably similar to the effect we might also expect to see with placebo so any effects of um i would suggest that any effects of um cannabinoids in terms of pain likely to be what we call the small effect size they're not going to be massive reductions in the paint level positively only about 10 to 20 reduction um what are they useful well hemp is probably the biggest product um cannabis i find fascinating because cannabis is what we call a dioecious plant it exists in both male and female forms the male form does not produce flowers obviously because it's a male and therefore it has very very very low levels of thc within the mail form and cannabis species of hemp are being grown commercially both in tasmania and here in queensland we have lots of growers of hemp commercially in queensland and that hemp is being grown grown mainly for its fiber content and that fiber content is being used in paper in the production of rope hemp ropes in the production of textiles and it's also no now incorporated into building materials it's interesting my cousin has actually built a house um just at the top of the mountain um and the just behind sydney and she's built it out of bricks which are made of hemp marijuana is the name given to describe the female plant and the female plant is grown mainly because it contains thc we can see the growth of the female plants you see it on the television again when the various sort of growing labs are being raided by the police and as you'll see from the the video of those of those seizures in the television you'll see that they require big sources of light they need a very high level of thc and they also generally grown in small confined areas so they get a very high level of humidity and that increases the thc content of the cannabis being grown so the use of for instance hydroponic growing is is how they they're trying to grow these things to really for the thc content and marijuana is the most widely used recreational drug in the whole world they have been used traditionally for medicine there's use of cannabis ferments and traces back around about 2 700 years to china and there are reports in um in some of the tablets from sumeria uh which is even earlier than that uh of cannabis being used then what they call the milk um of the cannabis is being used and is generally it is a mixture of the plant in a cow's milk or in butter because you use the butter or the cow's milk as the carrier so you get the drug dissolved into the fat content of the milk and that's the way we absorb it it was used generally in medicine if you go and look at for instance the the raw flying doctor museum in in alice springs you'll see bottles which are labeled uh cannabis used in medicine and that carried on in medicine until about the 1930s and in the 1930s the whole the the united nations or the league of nations as it was then began to get some controls put into place on how drugs of potential misuse drugs like opium should be produced controlled within countries and traded between countries and this re this is when cannabis is rescheduled as a schedule 9 medicine in other words it was an illicit drug and couldn't be used in medicine anymore cannabis the cannabis varieties the the sativa the indica and the root oralists all contain different levels of thc and so the growing conditions and the species is the important thing and the ratio between thc cbd is important as cannabidiol appears to attenuate the opposite effects of thc so whereas the use of high levels of thc can cause anxiety cbd seems to reduce that two most people most people using cannabis recreationally smoke it and on heating if you heat the cannabis to more than 100 degrees for 90 milligram for 90 mils or if you burn cannabis which is how we smoke it obviously this converts other cannabinoids into thc so csc and cbd are really i find them fascinating because they are essentially the same chemical in terms of their con their constitu their constitution it's the structure in which they put together varies and there is a degree of relationship between thc and cbd so that when you hit cbd you convert into tsc so this is why when individuals smoke cannabis they try to produce a very very hot burning um burning flame if you like within the cannabis which is why we use we see then the use of um processes to school the smoke downs so it can be inhaled hence the use of for instance hubble bubble and bonds it just reduces the temperature of the smoke cbd seems to control thc metabolism by its effects on cytokine p450 and i'll talk more about people 50 in a minute the psychoactive effects of cannabis are biphasic so we get initial primary relaxation and euphoria and this is what most people use it for then get some secondary psychoactive effects such as the facility for what is described as philosophical thinking and perspective metacognition all then followed by cases of by reports of anxiety and paranoia and this is always effect so when most people start to smoke cannabis you don't get if you don't use the cannabis very effectively and so all you're going to see are the first effects of relaxation and euphoria it's only when people become experienced in smoking cannabis and smoke more are they going to get the risks of these other psychoactive effects and large enough doses can produce both auditory and visual hallucinations if you look at this which is comparing if you like the dependence potential and the toxicity of these drugs a single active um active dose you'll see that in the top right there you've got heroin very very high dependence potential and also you know it's not that toxic um or sorry so it is highly toxic the next one down you'll see is alcohol that has moderate dependency but again quite high toxicity then you've got morphine cocaine nbma there's another level of toxicity nicotine is there really potent dependence potential which is why people find it so hard to stop smoking and then you got pentabarbitol rohypnol for instance and ketamine marijuana is right down here on the left-hand side of the grass only at moderate low risk of dependence and also a very very low toxicity so it is from all effects that we can see it has very little toxicity in fact as far as we can tell there have been few deaths associated with the use of marijuana but there are some of uh some are recorded usually by misadventure as a consequence after smoking as in recorder there is an increased risk of developing schizophrenia noted in younger patients who are using large doses of cannabis this is around about your 18 years and younger there are some potential risks of reduced fertility or increased early miscarriage but we don't know whether that might be the effect of smoking it's been seen in in um in recreational use but not in medicinal use and we think it's probably the effect of smoking in california about five percent of women were taking recreational cannabis during pregnancy especially they were saying for you morning sickness and that seems to be increasing so we're likely to see increased use of cannabis being used during pregnancy it is excreted in breast milk and that can occur for up to six days after the use of it so what we're trying to go and explain is that yes it's not so much it's it's it's not harming you it's not harming your baby but it's the long-term effects is that this gonna you know you're gonna get it you're screating breast milk and do you want your baby to go and get that drug the risks to infants are not known but it isn't considered to be safe um there are some side effects usually associated with anxiety depression and the if then the effects of paranoia we've got a cannabis discontinuation syndrome which is truly an addiction um withdrawal effect but there's also this thing called cannabis induced hyperemesis syndrome where long-term uses of inhaled cannabis experience repeated and severe bouts of vomiting and that is often as i said long-term regular use they also have you also find many of them have a to get over the vomiting they experience that they take very hot baths they find that by increasing their body temperature it release the symptoms so if you these are patients that you might see within the emergency department i'm not going to talk so much about synthetic cannabinoids i wanted just to ignore that medical marijuana now legalized in many states in the u.s it was there were moves to introduce it into australia uh there was a um a big um poll open a poll conducted by the morgan group um looking at what did the public population of australia think about the medical use of marijuana we can see here that campbell newman was open-minded about it the new south wales government thought we should they would support some clinical trials for its use the victorian premier came up with the same tony abbott said because he would pm at the time that he had no problems with the medical use of cannabis um and mike baird announced for the new south wales government that he was going to fund three studies for use in children with severe epilepsy for use in priority care and also for cancer-induced nausea or chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting 2016 we had a amendment made to the narcotics act which passed the way to legalizing medicinal cannabis this is a change in the way that the federal government interacted with that international law and the uh the u.n each state then had its own regulations on how medicinal act canada's could be accessed and in queensland this was controlled initially through the bedrock mrq the medicines regulation uh unit in queensland health and there are three types of prescriber authorized you can get a an authorized specialist so for instance a neurologist who's specializing in the treatment of muscle with multiple sclerosis can become an authorized prescriber for cannabis but only for that condition we can have any medical prescriber any doctor can prescribe medicinal cannabis but they can only um but this only for that individual patient and the drugs that obtained through the sas or special access scheme and also doctors can become authorized as prescribing within the clinical trial now medicinal cannabis is not the same as recreational cannabis to begin with um we have said right medicinal cannabis should not be smoked in the way that we do radish regular or recreational cannabis we as healthcare professionals cannot support the use of smoking as a delivery process so if you see someone comes in and they want to smoke their cannabis they come in with a bag of flowers and they want us to to smoke that cannabis for a medical purpose that is not medicinal cannabis the problem with cannabis is what we could it is a what we call a promiscuous plant in other words it takes into the plant everything that is in its surroundings so if you expose the plant to the heavy metal for instance found within soil within australia that heavy metal increases into comes into the plant and contaminates the plant if you're going to expose that plant to a um an insecticide to make sure that you don't have bugs growing on the plant you're going to get that insecticide within the cannabis so medicinal cannabis has got to be free of chemical and heavy metal contamination it also has to be free of the fungal contamination because if you can think about the growing advantages the temperature and the humidity that means that this is a very nice growth media for various fungi so the product has got to be free of those and must be tested for that before it can be used as a medicine it's got to be produced under what we call gmp or brood manufacturing practice standards the same sort of standards that are applied to any medicine used within our practices in in in healthcare so it has to be the same degree of quality as for instance a paracetamol tablet that you might buy over the counter or a dose of catiopine that you're giving to your patient with with schizophrenia it's got to be the same type of quality and that's done under the gmp requirements uh in 2016 in queensland we took the decision was made to amend the narcotics act which is part of the drugs and poisons regulations to permit the medicinal use of cannabis thc any product containing thc is scheduled as s8 a controlled drug whereas cbd only products are scheduled s4 or prescription only medicines in february this year cbd was down regulated to an s3 product that's a pharmacy only medicine as long as it's available in a daily dose of 150 milligrams or less the cbd content has got to comprise at least 98 of the total content and the thc content must be one percent or less so you cannot get high doses of thc with cbd over the counter it must be packed in a blister or strip packaging or other child resistant packaging in packs of not more than 30 days supply and it's available over the counter only for adults of 18 years or older who have declared that they are not planning or be planning on becoming pregnant or breastfeeding and all the products that are suitable for this have to meet what we call aust l or us are austin australian listed or australian regulated products so if you look at most of your over-the-counter complementary medicines the most commonly used ones like for instance fish oil will all be at hostile or austr quality this is a quality measurement similar to gmp at the present time there are no cbd products that meet these requirements and therefore if you if your patients go to a community pharmacy there is no products that they have available that meet these requirements even though they're able to sell them there's no products that is not the problem of the government this is a problem of the manufacturers they have not done the work to meet hostel or our star pro regulations so that's why we don't have any of the problem products available what we do have medicinal cannabis how's it taking well we have oral formulations the original ones was what we call mullaway's cannabis tincture it was an alcohol-based product and you used to have to add that to water so it's a cannabis extract you can of course get your your your cannabis cookies these are baked products where you're using the butter very high levels of butter in your cookie as a way of getting cannabis into the product again no controls or standardization available there are oil or which we call drops these are olive oil coconut oil sesame oil mct oil are being used commonly these are oral drops we've also got an oral mucosal spray for instance sativex or navixomol is which is a pharmaceutical product which has been available in australia for nearly 10 years but used only in the management of um muscle spasm within multiple sclerosis and was not available on the pbs so it's still expensive as i said we don't we don't support smoked cannabis what we do support in the law is what we call vaped or vaporized products where you're using a very low temperature less than 100 degrees centigrade which doesn't burn the product or decarboxylate the problem so you're going to get the initial meds chemicals involved in that product and what's available then inhaled and we've also got coming through we've got some dry powder inhalers similar to that used in the management of asthma and then there are topical treatments for instance there are still creams and ointments available and then they're in the process of developing some transdermal patches of cannabinoids as well we've got or we've had three cannabis products available uh worldwide and we've i come from the uk and i've used all three of those products not personally i mean my patients there's a medicine called nabalone which is a synthetic thc product trade name sesame and that was introduced in around about the early 1980s for cancer induced nausea and vomiting then there was a second product called drainable marinol which is a another more potent form of thc again used for the same indication both were widely available in the in the uk but they were also very sedating i was using i was working in oncology in that time and i used to often suggest to patients that if they couldn't afford dabbling that smoking something before they came to the clinic might be helpful in reducing their nausea and vomiting it was a major problem because we really didn't have anything that was effective then towards the end of the 1980s we had a new drug was released on the market called ondansetron now most of you will be familiar with this zofran it was marketed by glaxo as an antimatter for cancer-induced nausea and vomiting it wasn't so effective against nausea but it was probably the most effective meds that i have ever seen for controlling cancer induced vomiting suddenly almost overnight vomiting related to chemotherapy was a was really a a situation of the past and with that we stopped using any of the cannabinoids for this particular purpose we've also now got a wide range of imported pharmaceutical medicinal cannabis products most of them are coming they're imported from canada and from europe where they've been widely available and these are brought products made by for instance tilray and med relief in canopy in canada and bedrican which is uh which is a product coming from from holland in europe we now have more products being being produced in australia there is a a cannabis producing farm in the western suburbs in brisbane there is another farm which is located behind the sunshine coast and there's a couple more farms in in in other parts of queensland we've actually got a a company that processes the the plants and produces the medications which is based here on the gold coast um out at some point after southport so these are products that are being developed but they're not widely available because they because of the the problems with with cannabis on medicinal cannabis um sativex is the the one that's been around longest that's the biximo manufactured by gw pharmaceuticals registered as i said several years ago 2013 was registered by the cga in australia it's a spray that contains both thc and cbd these are both being produced out of what we call genetically modified strains so you're taking a specific strain of your cannabis sativa you're growing the female plants and they're modified genetically to produce dust thc and then there's another strain which is just producing cbd this product has been available for a long time it never got pbs endorsement it's licensed only for ms related spasticity and it was too expensive for most individuals to be able to use i was involved in running a clinical trial when i worked in leeds we had we were using oral drainable at the time so i was using a thc product uh for use in central pain and we used an n of one research methodology so we had individual patients and we gave them um the medication the active medication for one week and then we swapped it to a placebo for a week in this case we use vitamin e capsules as the placebo and we alternated between that for eight cycles which is important within the methodology we had 36 patients identified but we only able to enter nine patients onto our study despite this being a university hospital which had twice the beds of gold coast we were only able to find 36 patients that met our criteria for admission 50 of those patients were elderly patients after having had a stroke which is the cause of their central pain the other fifty percent were younger patients uh with with multiple sclerosis we then did the study at the end we got them to come to manage their pain with weekly pain diaries and we looked at changes and then looked at a patient global impression of change at the end of the study there was no change in pain scores at any point in any of the groups in our study but in the post patient global impression of change the older population of patients did not like dranabhanol at all they hated it didn't want to take it they didn't like the way it made them feel the psychotropic effects and they didn't like the way it made them so that stimulated their appetite what we used to call with recreational cannabis the munchies the ms patients on the other hand are younger patients universally a light phenomenal and wish to continue but they told us it wasn't for pain relief but for relief of a condition which i wasn't aware of at the time in ms which is a pain related to bladder spasm that intense discomfort within the lower abdomen associated with the desire to empty the bladder but perhaps not being able to for for uh for various reasons social reasons for the ms patients it produced this bladder spasm so you got that really intense discomfort we obviously was a negative study it wasn't able to show any benefits so it wasn't accepted for president for publication but we did get it presented at the british pain society meeting and it's there in publication now only as a as a paper presented at that meeting so the conclusion i want to say is that there's still no evidence of benefit from no conclusive evidence of benefit with with medicinal cannabis but there's also no but we should need to be aware that no evidence of benefit does not equate to no evidence to no evidence of benefit so that the fact that we can find no evidence doesn't mean that there is no benefit seen in some individuals and i think that's one of the difficulties that we have you get lots of positive response but they're all end of one they're all individual experiences which are being promoted but from our experience in the clinic we're seeing lots of patients it doesn't help still requires as ian said it still requires a very carefully constructed treatment plan and a follow-up strategy you need to make sure that it's an ability as a default to how to get out from using it if you need to you need to monitor the use and the dosage and also to think about how can we prevent this product being diverted so if you've got a thc rich product how does that mean it's going into the patient and not being sold on the streets we also need to evaluate its dependence risk so it's almost like an opioid replacement study we need to think here very very quickly we've got one breaking story in that we now have a product called epidiolex which has become just available on the pbs this is a cbd only product made by gw and it's now on the pbs for the treatment of a very rare myoclonic epilepsy in infancy called a draves syndrome it's very very rare but it is a really poorly controlled epilepsy in children we've seen i've seen photos stories on the news of kids who are having you know 50 60 epileptic seizures a day and the claim from mum is that when i started using cannabis on my child their their epilepsy ceased now this is a trial that was then conducted using cbd for the treatment of epilepsy and it does appear to be very effective and ian referred to the druvinsky study which showed that there were some patients who stopped having seizures completely but most patients had a reduction at that stage i'm going to stop we'll open up for any questions yes thank you you've been here just wondering if any idea of any timeline where the um the pharmacy only cbd might be available the current estimate is there are no products being even been submitted to the tga for registration registration takes a while to achieve so it's going to be probably in the end of 2020 2022 rather or perhaps mid-2023 it's a question that's similar to when is going international flights going to restart up we just don't know it's a guess thank you i've got another question from the room any evidence of how long-term use affects the immune system um and what that means for people undergoing chemotherapy no no evidence i know of anecdotes i've got a friend who had um a testicular cancer who has been taking cbd religiously since before his diagnose when he was first diagnosed to now um he's doing incredibly well but he has had one recurrence and he's had treatment for that so whether it's doing anything we just don't know but it's because it's cbd it's unlikely to do any harm but whether it does any good is is unknown thank you uh another question from the red is there any evidence we know that cannabis um straight cannabis issues can cause anxiety um especially longer term use is there any evidence just around cbd in itself isolated for reducing anxiety there are anecdotal reports but nothing of any clinical significant or clinically proven studies yet most of the studies are poorly controlled it's very difficult to control to to provide a good placebo for cannabis particularly thc containing cannabis most individuals know when they're taking thc so to provide a placebo to do a comparative study is very difficult they're also the most the studies are very small um mainly because just how difficult it was to get a decent product and that's i think is the biggest problem is that most of the studies are referred to recreational sources and which honestly we just don't know what's in them can i add to that that when you talk to our psychologists they say ah but the patients really like because they feel better but it's not quantified in terms of is that anxiety or other things so they don't want to give it up but you can't say it's definitely for anxiety they just feel relaxed and better thank you um so from uh from the chat questions um the the notion of of harms and risk benefit analysis this has come up a bit in the chat um around um oviatt overview and replacement therapy and uh the idea that okay if it may be or maybe it is slightly less effective but is it safer you know with that therapy we are replacing one substance with another so there were just there was interest around um your yeah your responses to that yeah i'll talk about that and um so what i saw living in the bush where unemployment was very high and recreational drug was very high use was high you saw you knew a lot of the patients were using cbd or cannabis not a smoking cannabis not um using medicinal cannabis there was also a strong use of other recreational drugs there was always that concern when you you assess patients that they were moving from cannabis as a teenager where it was easy to access and everyone's handing it around to moving to stronger drugs is it true a transition from one drug to another it's unclear but you've got to take keep in mind that in the younger generation they're invincible they actually do lots of things thinking it is harmless and then and they have that risk in those environments where listed drugs are very available of actually experimenting with other drugs alcohol was also heavy heavily used in the bush because again boredom probably more than anything else and easily available and that probably pains the same picture so you can't say definitely cannabis leads to other drug use is it an indicator not specifically um but it's that it's that behavior of well this didn't do anything maybe you could try something else that you have to keep in mind when you're prescribing pretty well any drug with a risk of dependence just another thing as well from the rural environment most of the cannabis that's being used in that environment is grown locally and they're not using the same techniques that we're seeing for instance the bikey gangs or the or the illicit cannabis growers being using within for instance the gold coast in the city environment so the thc content of bush cannabis is much less than the the skank that we're seeing being grown in the cities and it is probably safer because of that the more cbd pro content of that bush cannabis the more antagonism you're getting between the cbd and the thc i think when you're doing assessments of patients and considering the use of cannabis you're weighing up their risk of substance use disorder so the object risk tolls and stuff like that will give you a pain a picture they're not perfect even though a validated tool they're not perfect and so it's about that again that's that clinical experience about recognizing when someone's drifting down that pathway and it's nice to be able to this particular patient that we saw it's nice to be involved in the early phase as opposed to when i'm usually involved in the later phases when they've already got a poly substance dependence okay thank you i'm aware that we are heading over time um this probably calls for another another webinar because there's been a great a great deal of interest do you have any future predictions given the decriminalization um the act um that's that's another question a range of questions from the panel i might finish with that one but over-the-counter for use in the future or are we asking you a question that's too difficult i think it's um we um we've been exposed to a number of drugs that have been been presented as useful in pain management in the last 10 years and each time we've seen an issue regardless the one that really stands out it was promoted as the alternative opioids for back pain and so we got over prescribed and now we're dealing with an actual addiction crisis well not crisis but a problem and so and now but it's already been addressed in australia and doctors are now not prescribing it as much recognizing that there is there is a dependence to that medication and you certainly see in correctional services i i every time i talk to someone i say oh is it is you know a thousand milligrams bad in the correctional services and and clients in those places you can see up to 3 000 milligrams used for its effect and and that is a problem for something that they promoted as harmless but it's definitely not so while cannabis is probably a safer product especially manufactured in the way we're starting to regulate it you've got to keep that in mind for everyone at risk which is not a huge percentage of the patients but it's there and so and we don't want this just this need to oh look i just need something else to manage my pain and it's not showing that it's that useful at this stage
ZmO93H5-ntc,Developing registered medicinal cannabis treatments powered by clinical data.,2021-06-18T09:58:48Z,good afternoon thank you very much and thanks to the previous presenters for some great talks and the online participants for sticking around i think you'll like amirya's unique approach to the medicinal cannabis opportunity globally and look forward to sharing that with you if you could go to the next slide skip a couple if you don't mind great so myria's goal is to develop registered treatments these are formally approved medications with major global regulators where uh we achieve that by the clinical evidence that we gather treating patients with unmet needs across our clinical network and i'll explain how that is all put together shortly we've had a great return over the last 12 months some good investor support behind our drug development programs which we've announced we recently raised five million dollars last month are in a strong cash position uh to get that work done you go to the next slide please great so we've got some really unique assets here we have a network of specialist medical centers around australia that treat patients with a diverse range of unmet needs most of those patients are referred to us because they're not getting response from standard treatment most those referrals come from their specialist physician and we have a really good rapport with the medical community in that regard we have seen over 4 000 patients and each of those patients is now part of our ongoing longitudinal registry which is our other core asset and point of difference we've invested heavily in the data infrastructure that supports our clinical service and that has allowed us to build an incredible real world data set about how these treatments work best and for whom and we use those insights to provide individualized care back to our patients and it also helps us launch very focused drug development programs excuse me for specific drug dose indications and you can see the ones that are in progress right now emd 3 focused on psychological distress that is aimed to be a cannabinoid over-the-counter medicine under the schedule 3 program here in australia working on that with partner can group we have an emd in development as well for symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and we also have a partnership with mind medicine australia working on mdma for post-traumatic stress disorder which i'm happy to speak about as well and i'll say one key thing about i guess taking a leadership position in registered drug treatments one really needs intellectual property around ideally the dose form and secondly the method of use for these treatments which are essentially generic medications applied to new problem spaces we can go to the next slide please here's the brains of our operation which is the robust clinical data we've gathered i want to highlight a couple of things here one is the diversity of the patients that we see at emmeria and at our emerald clinics children as young as two patients as old as 96 the second thing is the diversity of experience we have with the products that we prescribe anywhere between zero to six hundred milligrams of cbd a day anywhere between zero and 200 milligrams of thc so we have a really good read and grasp on how these treatments work what the side effect profiles are like uh what are the clinical outcomes that patients can experience and it's those insights which enable us to give good care to our patients but also supports our strategic drug development work we could go to the next slide please there was a question asked earlier in the day about what patients receive medicinal cannabis here is a snapshot of outpatient population a majority come in for complex chronic pain but you can see we have this very long tail of patients with primary mental health concerns cancer-related symptom treatment neurological disorders and a long list of other indications as well so really the patients receiving medicinal cannabis or seeking help for their condition is really represents a really diverse rich group each of these unmet needs becomes potentially an indication for a new registered drug treatment we can go to the next slide terrific and so i want to kind of emphasize here what advantages we have by running our own clinical service because of our patients and they and their complex clinical conditions at some extremes the clinical service is almost as important in the care and delivery as the drug treatment alone and that's certainly true when we talk about some of the frontier areas like psychedelic assisted therapy for things like post-traumatic stress disorder the clinical service and how you wrap around the care team around that treatment is almost just as important as the drug therapy on the other extreme it is possible to take stand drug treatments that could be relevant for a much larger patient population and if you take those treatments through formal registration they can become over-the-counter or prescription medicines for a much much larger population and i think that really opens the real market for for these treatments so right now you can see we have here laid out on this diagram both programs uh at the over-the-counter side for emdw3 and of course some of the more complex spaces like mdma for ptsd we can go to the next slide please here's our pipeline and a little bit about uh the progress of these different uh treatment programs and indications uh a couple are well underway emd double o3 about to commence pivotal studies mdw4 finalizing dose forms there and they will enter pivotal studies also but as you can see a very long list of potential indications that we can explore each represent global market opportunities for us next slide please and the next one now why are we so committed to registration we heard from cassandra earlier today about there are now 190 you have to update this slide different medical products available in australia but really only one with formal registration and pbs coverage that's gw farmer's epidialex if we go to the next slide please uh just look at the prescription volumes if we take the estimate that roughly there are 8 to ten thousand sass b prescriptions per month in australia for medicinal cannabis perhaps that totals to maybe a hundred thousand let's say it's two hundred thousand medicinal cannabis prescriptions over a year uh we would say that they represented terrific growth but just look at the number of antidepressants prescribed annually in australia 29 million or in the uk nearly 70 million prescriptions per year we also heard some uh excitement around the growth of authorized prescribers nearly 400 authorized prescribers in australia there are 42 000 prescribing general practitioners in australia so to really reach the true potential of this market if we are truly committed to producing medicines to reach patients then truly the considerate thing to do is to take those treatments through the registration pathway and that's what we're committed to doing if we can go to the next slide please it makes commercial sense to do the registration work as well gw pharma was originally acquired by jazz pharmaceuticals for seven billion dollars one of the chief medical officers and head of global r d karen smith is now part of our strategic advisory helping us think through the proper pharmaceutical pathways to take our cannabis products through the registration work and to create that value we can go to the next slide please and the one after this great so a couple of things that motivate us we know we're making a difference to patients lives we have lots of case studies like bob where we see a gentleman who had chronic pain for a long period of time was heavily medicated on a range of different treatments including high dose opioids but really had poor quality of life at about six months of care with us after an individualized treatment program he settled on a treatment that worked for him it was very effective he became off all his pain medications including all of his opioids but we can also see great improvements in his quality of life and it's stories like bobs which motivate us to try and find how can we make a difference to other people like bob who are out there who can't reach our clinics if we go to the next slide please and we know that bob is not just a one-off case we recently completed a really fascinating research project with ikuvia who are a major global cro a clinical research organization their market cap is around 44 billion dollars they help the world's largest pharmaceutical companies get registered treatments iqvia also have access to some really interesting real-world data particularly in australia and we were able to look at the dispensing prescription activity of patients that come to see treatment at emmeria and then we could look back 12 months before those patients arrived at our clinics and have a look at their opioid consumption and as you can see in this chart to the left of the yellow line was the opioid average monthly opioid use for a group of patients stratified by dependency on opioids and as you can see to the right after treatment with us a significant reduction in their opioid consumption now that's not just our clinics or our nurses telling you that that's what we're seeing we're actually seeing this validated in the real world prescription behaviors of these patients and now we're able to ask a wholly better really interesting questions how can we identify these patients can we develop an indication how can we come up with a custom dose form to treat these people and get that treatment registered globally we go to the next slide please and the one after this so right now one of our key leading programs is emd003 we bring a lot of our experience and our prior investment to this program and it's one of the reasons we have confidence we'll be one of the first across the line we have real world data on the dose form we have ip around the method of use we have developed protocols and a clear regulatory strategy in place to deliver on the s3 program and we have a unique dose form with partner can group as well which has already completed some of the preliminary clinical work required to get this drug registered so once we have our pivotal studies underway and completed we think we can be one of the first to get a schedule 3 registration and really just prove our method and our model and then do that again for other indications and other dose forms and then take those treatments to the bigger markets globally we can go to the next slide please a little bit what looks ahead particularly for emd 003 we're on the precipice of commencing our trials those trials should last a few months we'll get those completed and then the dossier can be prepared but also wanted to point out some of the other activities running in parallel here particularly our commitment and investment into the psychedelic assisted therapy space for patients with severe ptsd also some of the registration activities underway for md4 and to watch this space for announcements around our global program we go to the next slide and the one after that i think i'm done thanks tim i'll take your questions yeah thanks michael we actually had uh mind medicine australia on some time back and we we had a webinar on the psychedelic industry in in canada in particular and they run clinics to with patients who are traumatized and obviously use mdma to help that trauma what what why did you go down this clinical path in terms of having clinics i mean it seems like a very powerful way for people looking for treatment to come to you why did you adopt that model yeah absolutely great question it has been a significant and substantial uh investment for us to establish these clinics we don't run them for profit we run them in order to get the very best uh clinical outcome and and also the very best data from our patients in evidence and so that speaks to why we did this it was about getting clear and high quality clinical evidence that can inform how these treatments can be best used and ultimately can inform how to register these treatments we saw that the growth in the special access scheme was just a short-term solution to what is a long-term problem if these are truly going to become legitimate mainstream medicines then they need to be accompanied with robust clinical evidence and there just wasn't that evidence around and people weren't investing in traditional trials to get that evidence so it made sense to set up evidence generating clinics and that's what we did and and and sorry for just my understanding is that part of the future we're a consumer for one of the better or a patient comes to you for has been recommended or prescribed by their doctor to come to you for further treatments that's right our model usually works the patients are referred to us when nothing else is working we then do an evaluation check that they're suitable for medicinal cannabis put them in a program that can work for them our long-term goal though is to take those insights develop treatments that can work for patients like them and have those become mainstream options for regular doctors and therefore reach a much larger patient population and a much larger commercial market too and then our clinics will run as the place of last resort for the heartsync patients so we can tackle the next unmet need with the next treatment option and and just looking through your shareholder base the the washer family who i believe is you're also your chairman i own 33 of the the company can you tell us a little bit about uh their involvement and background sure yeah stuart's one of the founders stuart washer is also involved heavily in a number of biotech companies sonata involved in stem cells ortho cell regenerative medicine has a lot of really great experience taking drugs through the fda process and in biotech uh he's one of the early founders of of of myria originally emerald clinics uh takes a he's got a strong holding and he's holding on tight and um just a question here how do you manage kind of a complex legal liability issues you know all treatments have a range of real life outcomes and possibly unexpected reactions how do you manage that that's a great question we pay very close attention to adverse events in fact adverse events typically under reported for all prescription medicines so we carefully check in with every patient we titrate doses to watch for adverse events and it's one of the things we track we use a number of clinical trial assessments or clinical trial grade assessments to get a read on where those adverse events are happening as well so it's one of the aspects of this treatment which we characterize very deeply we think that's incredibly important not just for patient care but also for generating evidence that a regulator will accept because as you would know safety is one of the critical dimensions efficacy does this work being the second and then quality of the product being really the third consideration that regulators have you
KgD_vwGYcQk,Medicinal Cannabis - Your questions answered,2021-10-27T06:51:51Z,um and so i'd like to introduce bob fullerton who's the national education or manager a little green farmer and she's going to talk about medicinal cannabis and your questions answered is the title of her um presentation now barb is the head of education and distribution at little green pharma and this is australia's first company to produce locally grown and made medical cannabis products for the last four years she's overseen the company's education strategy and product development barb is passionate about making a difference in the lives of patients and loves to talk to doctors and patients to advocate for better access to medical cannabis bob is also on a mission to educate others nationally and to change some of the outdated legislation around the treatment option focusing currently on the thc drug testing in relation to driving so welcome bob and thanks for joining us um on screen thanks for having me can everyone hear me okay all right um so yeah thank you so much for the opportunity and i'm sorry i couldn't be there in person but one of the blessings of covid i think is the advent of um online zoom and all these sorts of things so i will get started so i guess it's important to understand the context of a medicinal cannabis and i like talking a little bit about the history um it's been used for thousands of years the earliest i guess known recordings of it was a chinese pharmacopoeia which is thousands of years old and it was used legally until the early 1900s then something changed and i won't go into this in too much detail and it's horrendous when you read it but essentially what happened in the u.s was prohibition of alcohol ended and there was a whole department looking for a new public enemy and that's when the marijuana tax act of 1937 was introduced and the american medical association actually stood up in front of congress and said this is an important medication and needs to be accessed by patients and it was then because of pressure government pressure and looking for a new public enemy in the u.s it was then added to the narcotics act of i think 1962 which banned medical cannabis globally at that point so that's when a lot of the research halted um if you there's a lot of misconceptions around medical cannabis and one of them is around the toxicity of it and the risk of overdose so if you look at alcohol as an example if this it's one in ten so for example if four drinks would get you drunk or happy 40 could potentially kill you so the lethal toxicity of cannabis is 1 in 20 000 so it's actually impossible to to overdose and there's also a very low dependent risk when you're looking at things like caffeine or comparing it to alcohol so it's it's 0.8 and this study was done using recreational cannabis which is typically higher in thc and i'll talk a little bit more about that so from a safety profile it's a very safe medication in terms of i guess the history and understanding that in a bit more detail a lot it was used in the early 1900s but there wasn't much known about it um they didn't understand how it worked or why it worked um this gentleman up in the corner is rafael mushulum and he is i call him the the grandfather of missile cannabis because he took the time to really understand the plant in a lot more detail and isolated thc for the first time in the 1960s um he then advocated for research to be able to be done in the 80s and in 90s in israel it was then used for the first time for medical use and there's a lot of really great studies that have come out of israel we knew then how it was working with thc but we didn't know what body systems it was working on so we all have our own endocannabinoid system and produce endogenous cannabinoids so if you go for a run or do you exercise that high that you feel is actually your body's own thc for example um it was then used in it's legalized in 49 out of 50 states in the u.s in different areas for different reasons canada is legalized at australia legalized it in 2016 and then canada for recreational in 2018. it's important to understand as well that in all of those countries the legalization has been very much a patient-led um movement um and this is a picture of dan haslam and lucy haslam lucy haslam today is still very much an advocate for patient access to medical cannabis in australia and this is his son dan so lucy is a nurse her husband was a police officer or is a police officer and their son dan was diagnosed with bowel cancer in his early 20s and they found medical cannabis worked really well for him for his symptom management it helped him put on weight it helped him sleep better it reduces anxiety and most importantly he reduced his pain levels now they unfortunately um dan passed away in 2015 um but in 2016 that's when it was legalized here in australia um and the law that was passed was called dan's law um so talking a little bit more about medical cannabis it's a plant and a medicine but it's also not a single molecule so there are many bioactive components in the cannabis plant and the cannabis flower and we aim to capture all that in the medicine so there's over 500 active ingredients including thc and cbd which you've probably heard of but there's also a bob yeah i'm sorry to interrupt yeah this sounds a little bit disjointed okay you're speaking quite fast okay i can slow down it's a little bit tricky to pick up their presentation and you're obviously saying some really important things let me try and watch everything hot spots sorry just give me a second so just give us two things to see if we can for a cbd for anxiety have skyrocketed um and i'll show you some of those stats in a minute um the most common side effects for cannabis are the doctors will tell you the most common are things like dry mouth um some patients if they try and titrate too quickly um and move up might feel a little bit of dizziness or drowsiness um but but with cannabis the the um titration processes start low and go slow um so so your body adjusts um interestingly um there's some data that came out of the us and we're doing a talk later tonight about it in the effect of cannabis on opioids because how cannabis is processed through the body's system it actually allows you to reduce reliance on opioids and in the u.s in some data that they looked at in states where cannabis was legalized they showed they noticed a reduction in opioid prescriptions in overall dosage and importantly they noticed a big reduction in hot opioid related hospitalizations as well as overdose so there's some interesting research being done in that space at the moment understanding i guess how many people are accessing medical cannabis it's quite a lot there's been over 170 000 approvals for medical cannabis through one pathway that's the sas b pathway um since it was legalized but as you can see by this graph every month it's growing month on month so it's growing exponentially so that doesn't mean there's 170 000 individual patients because those approvals are required if you're changing medication as well as if um you're on multiple medication so we estimate the number of patients to be probably around 65 or 70 000. um there's different forms of medical cannabis oil is still the most popular way that it's taken there's also flour which is the fastest growing category flowers used for things like breakthrough pain some people are using it for insomnia or sleep um it's also available in things like capsules but again oil is the most popular the different onset of action so when you're in using vaporized form of cannabis it's a very quick onset which is why it's used for breakthrough symptoms whereas ingested has a much longer almost like a slow release medication which is why it's a more popular so again the main uses of in australia are pain so about 65 percent of the applications or approvals are for for pain then anxiety this used to be cancer related symptoms and palliative care but that's actually dropped down um but that pain is a broad category and doesn't include things like cancer pain so chronic pain is a very classic default that doctors use when they have to pick a reason that they're prescribing it so that will include a lot of cancer pain in there um there's a lot of research in terms of cancer symptom management um i won't go into that in too much detail and sorry this slide doesn't look right but there's a lot of evidence around the reduction in cancer symptoms for patients taking it there's not research around cancer killing cancer cells or things that's all pre-clinical so that none of that has been done in patients um but there is some there was a study shown recently for a glioblastoma multiforme where um again it improved the cancer symptoms um and in some patients i can't remember it was statistically um significant in terms of longevity um so what is the best formulation there's lots of different formulations of cannabis with different thc and cbd ratios and that depends on what it's being prescribed for so typically the balanced products equal thc and cbd is the starting point if you're looking at it for pain if for cbd dominant products that's usually more for anxiety related issues and if you have to drive unfortunately a cbd only product is probably the best option because at the moment patients are not legally supposed to drive with thc in their system even though it's been prescribed so that's there's a lot of debate about that and we're lobbing the government um pretty hard on that at the moment because cannabis has been excluded it's the only prescription medication where you can't actually drive so that's being lobbied at the moment um so who what patients are eligible for cannabis so you need to have tried other medications first so it can't be a first-line treatment although the tga will approve it if you refuse other treatments so if you don't want to take opioids um they don't you know they've taken you've taken them in the past or just flat out refused the tga will still approve it um for chronic pain but typically it's when other treatments have failed or caused unacceptable side effects is is the most common pathway so who can prescribe it at the moment in australia we lobbied really hard a couple years ago so any doctor any general practitioner is able to prescribe cannabis they might just not know how because most general practitioners don't use this the special access pathway but there's any medical cannabis company including little green pharma can assist doctors with that process oh gosh sorry the slide doesn't look great either so how are they accessing it as i touched upon before it's through this special access scheme and there's a website and it's very simple to navigate that and that's something that we help doctors with every day so essentially the doctor prescribing process is they assess the suitability of the patient they consider it a ratio so they have to choose which product they're going to prescribe they then put in an application they look at the dosing again as i said before it's start load goes slow they do regular monitoring until you reach a stable dose that will usually take about a month and then if it's not working as it should or their side effects they'll either change or cease the medication so at the moment probably most doctors will tell you probably about 70 percent of patients respond really well and 20 to 30 percent aren't responding which is like any any medication and that's an example of what a typical doctor how they would monitor you so usually they would get you back after the first week or two and then two to four weekly um driving as i said um at the moment we can't um it's not if you have thc in your system your doctor will tell you not to drive the the reality is most patients are driving with thc in their system if they're prescribed medically um but the doctor to protect themselves will tell you not to drive um and there is lobbying happening this drive change um as well as some local lobbying going on here in wa um so we're aiming to change that in the next 12 months so what's the cost um again when medical cannabis first came out it was extremely expensive and little green pharma proudly we benchmarked our pricing off of the black market or the green market so our um our message was if a patient can get it legally they should be they shouldn't be able to they shouldn't pay more than if they were getting it illicitly so that's how we benchmarked our pricing since then since we launched our first product almost four years ago the price has come down a lot which is great to see and some insurance companies are reimbursing and i recommend you if you have questions about whether your health company is reimbursing there's a really good list on honolee that you can that you can look up we also little green pharma formed a relationship with hif where they refund an additional 25 dollars for any every little green pharma script when we're looking at partnering with more ensure health insurers that way as well other ways to access discounted medication are three studies there's a quality of life study that we've partnered with the university of sydney where we offer subsidized medication and there's also a compassionate access program that a lot of companies have like little green pharma where we offer medication at no cost so there's definitely ways to different ways to access it depending on your circumstances um it's important to understand the the difference between medical and illicit cannabis um they're not the same thing and i'll take you quickly why um if you look at products that are sold legally like in the us where it's legal in 49 out of 50 states when they did studies on on what was on the label and how accurately those products were labeled between 69 and 83 of the products tested were inaccurately labeled so that's almost eight market in the uk where cbd is able to be sold over the counter um six out of ten products were inaccurately labeled four out of um 10 of those products had less than 50 of what was on the label so the active ingredients were less than half and importantly almost half of those products had measurable levels of thc so if you're buying that product in the uk and taking it and pulled over for driving you might show a positive test if you've just taken it um the other thing to be wary of is medical is cannabis is very absorbent it's so absorbent it was used after chernobyl to pull the radiation out of the soil so patients getting it from their mate jane down the road who's growing it organically in her backyard ted who lived there before i may have loved pesticides so that plant would be pulling those pesticides out of the soil that are still in there and if that plant grows that cannabis plant grows and goes to seed grows goes to seed three generations later those pesticides will still be in that plant so it's really important to understand the the risks of what that cannabis that's grown illicitly can have in it and particularly for immunocompromised patients that are going through chemotherapy um and have low immunity um aspergillus is very commonly grown it or commonly appears on cannabis plants um it's something that we need to test for regularly with our plants in an immune compromised patients that can lead to pneumonia which can be life-threatening so just a bio beware i'll take you quickly through the cultivation process you can understand that um so we were as i said the first grower in um australia um we grow in the south west somewhere in that circle i can't tell you why because we don't just to keep the people at work they're safe we grow from mother plants or clones so we take cuttings from our mother plants and plant them the cultivation process depending on the strain that we're growing takes between 10 and 14 weeks in that facility we grow indoor and we control everything about the plant the lighting humidity and temperature including the water and nutrients and that's to get a more consistent product um looking at the the trichomes of the plant where we where we get the resin from that we turn it into the medicine we want it to look slightly cloudy with little touches of amber tree there and then we know it's ready to harvest and coming up to harvest it's always depending on on when that plant gets that stage it's not a set date it's then dried in a gmp facility um and our we target the moisture levels to between 15 and 20 percent we then send it off for its first test where um we're testing for aflatoxins foreign matter heavy metals pesticides aspergillus as i said before to make sure that it's safe to turn into a resin we then take those trichomes and we extract them using ethanol extraction or co2 and that's where we get the the whole plant extract so we're taking that whole resin and um and converting it once we get that resin it looks like a sticky sort of honey material we send it off for its second test and that's how we know how much thc and cbd is in that product um so we can mix we then take the resin we mix it with an mct oil um and we bottle the medication and then we send it off for its third test to ensure that it's plus or minus 10 of what the label claim is as with any pharmaceutical medication so that's the process and that's all done in a gmp facility um the flower processing is similar but a little bit more laborious it involves burping which is a hilarious term which is really around making that moisture from the inside of the plant spread evenly throughout it it's then trimmed burped again and then goes to final packaging so that whole process takes about three weeks there's some talk around sativa and indica and there was a study recently sativa is typically thought to be a plant that's more wakeful whereas indica is used more in the evening for sleep and that's really dependent on the terpene profile the reality in these day and age is if a plant looks like a sativa plant um it doesn't mean that it has sativa properties and same with indica and there was recently a study that confirmed that so it's used more from a marketing sense um in in that in that respect and it's it's not true to form so just be be careful of that um for example indica oils if they might if they might have um terpenes that are synonymous with an indica plant but it doesn't mean that it's going to help you sleep um because if they might not actually be present and when you're taking an oil the terpenes aren't effective in that way it's only if you're inhaling the plant so just buy everywhere if you are looking at a specific type of cannabis flower um so i'll just touch upon some of our current research products that little green farm has undertaken i quite i touched upon the quest initiative which offers subsidized medication it's a quality of life evaluation study so patients enrolled just need to fill out questionnaires we supply product to the new south wales care trial which is an open label prospective clinical trial we also supply product to med can one and med can two which are two double-blind placebo-controlled studies with patients of an advanced cancer symptom and that's looking at symptom management out of queensland there's also a refractory pain trial that we are doing um and we're about to launch a fiber mileage of trial um so i guess just just to sum up um a little green pharma where we're here to help if you have any questions you can give us a call there's also some really great resources online at green choices as well as through the little green pharma product portal for doctors and if your doctor is open to prescribing but doesn't know what to do or how to do it i would encourage them to contact us because we can help them get to you know where they need to be and understand the process in a lot more detail um and i'll leave it there and open it to questions all good thank you bob that was very good and sorry to everybody in the room we were had a few uh problems with hearing everything but the slides explained very well um did anybody have any questions and we'll just get a microphone to the um lady so that you can hear hey um i just wanted to ask but particularly with reference to that last slide there didn't appear to be a lot of randomized trials done or sort of prove placebo versus treatment trials most of them seem to be open label is that a correct perception or if i got that wrong there there are definitely double-blind placebo-controlled trials being done absolutely um and that's across a lot of different disease states um i think the issue with cannabis in general is it's i always say it's not like a company has invented one molecule and then it's taking that product through to registration so you've got lots of companies around the world doing different types of trials so for example the modern trial going on in queensland that is double-blind placebo-controlled trial there was one recently done for um chemotherapy-induced nausea vomiting the results were published last year out of university of sydney um sorry in sydney that was that was done um so there definitely are double-blind placebo-controlled trials going on it's just the cost for a lot of cannabis companies to to participate in them um it's they're not as you know cash rich as some of the bigger pharmaceuticals but there there's a definitely collective um data um and if you were to the meta analysis that have been done on the data available do show for example that there's strong evidence in in pain um and um chemo there's chemotherapy induced nausea vomiting as well as um cancer symptom management there's strong evidence there there was also a question online yeah i saw that one so that one's do you have to go to a particular doctor to get prescribed the answer is no hi bob there's a question from diana online um asking do you have to go to a particular doctor to get prescribed yeah so the the answer to that question is no any doctor can prescribe medical cannabis however they might not be they might not feel comfortable or know how to do it so if they're open to it but don't know what to do i would encourage them to contact a producer like little green pharma and we can walk them through that process if they're not comfortable prescribing it i would encourage you to get in touch with again someone like little green pharma and we have a network of doctors that are open to prescribing and a lot of them are doing tele health so um but technically any doctor can prescribe it's just if they're willing or able to any more questions oh yeah we've got another question for you hi i i wasn't actually going to ask a question um but i was just going to comment i i use medicinal cannabis and have done for a couple of years now and started taking it for pain um the first thing that i noticed was oh my god my nausea had gone i didn't realize just how awful i felt all of the time until i'd been taking the oil for two maybe three weeks and was gradually increasing the dose my pain i am now on a pitifully small dose of tarjan um i don't nap every day during during the day um so my life has been it's been revolutionized transformed by using it so i'm it isn't a randomized controlled trial it's only a trial of one i i i'm assuming that it actually works because my other half who's here with with me today um he had a severe knee injury and had couldn't drive so i had to stop my cannabis so that i could be the designated driver and my symptoms returned i felt so awful i couldn't wait for him to be able to drive again and i'm back to being a rejuvenated me so um it may not work for everyone but i'm definitely a convert i was skeptical skeptical to start with but my god yes it's good oh that's so wonderful to hear just a question i think i understand that with something like silver chain for instance they won't provide the service if you're if you want to use that they're not going to be part of that relationship so is there any dialogue or authorization for that so that that can be accepted or how does that work why why aren't they able to be able to use it without feeling like they can't you know so it's just so just so i'm clear if will they not prescribe it or will they not help you take it if it was prescribed by someone else i give you this if you if you decide you want to um take canada cannabis oil for your treatment they will be unable to continue their service with you well without around that that's outrageous um i mean if you you get in touch with me outside of um this forum or if i can grab your details and get a bit more information i mean that's horrendous it's a legally prescribed medication so there's there's no reason legally if anything they would be at fault i would imagine if that's what's happening because it's a legally available medication so there's no reason that they should not dispense that's yeah that doesn't sound right but happy to explore that because yeah that's that's not right neither any other questions no okay thank you bob very much for your time that was really interesting and i think oh sorry sorry we've got another one online just getting the microphone from someone in the rural areas saying how do you supply it to patients australia post or does it need to be sent to the local hospital and then dispensed in the rural setting yep so that's a really good question um so cannabis is not something that is kept on the shelf in pharmacy because it's unregistered product which means it's not listed on the australian register of the therapeutic goods so it can be dispensed by any pharmacy it just means that they don't usually have it on their shelf so they have to order it in and it's usually next day delivery um we um little green pharma has a partnership with oxford compounding here in wa and they store and distribute a lot of our medications and they will post medication to a lot of patients particularly in rural settings as you said um you prefer to get it sent directly to them so that that's definitely an option so it's dispensed through pharmacy like any other pharmaceutical you if you do should go to the pharmacy with your script you'll you'll have to usually wait a day for it to be ordered in and then if you do rnwa and you have a script from a wa doctor it can be posted to you as well okay that's it yeah okay thank you very much bob again for your time um it was very good and if we can just say thanks [Applause] you
MQwE4YxTMQQ,CBD and Medical Marijuana Use for Cancer Patients,2021-12-03T02:44:43Z,want to use for cancer patients this is one of the most requested topics that we have within our community whether it's through our roundtable events our community events or even our social media platforms this topic seems to be controversial controversial but many myeloma patients have found pain relief thanks to these medicines there are also things that we need to consider however such as what are things that patients should know about these products and what are the risks and how could it possibly affect cancer treatment we're excited to hear more about this and what we need to know regarding medical marijuana and cbd use with cancer generally so it is now my pleasure to introduce our future speaker to you dr narupa raghunathan is a board certified is board certified in pediatrics and internal medicine and has experience at memorial sloan kettering in both cancer survivorship and integrative medicine she is the director of pediatric integrity integrative medicine with a consultative practice as well as oversight of the peds im program she also has a cbd medical cannabis consultative clinic these practices help guide active part patients and survivors as well as their caregivers towards important and supportive integrative therapies while advancing the mission of providing personalized care through and after cancer diagnosis we are so excited to have you here today thank you for joining us and the time is now yours thank you so much thank you so much audrey and i'm happy to be here with you guys um i'm going to share the screen in a second um hopefully it all works out so i'll just let audrey let me know if you see my email so let me just really quickly put this in all right so i'm going to talk about cannabis and cancer um let me just uh re-summarize a little bit of what audrey said about my background i like she mentioned and board certified in both pediatric and adult medicine and as a part of my role at memorial sloan kettering you know three or four years ago i was in survivorship um kind of transitioning to integrative medicine and at that point um i had colleagues in the oncology departments asking a lot of questions about cbd guidance and really realized there was a a need and kind of dived into that side of supportive care or integrative supportive care so um what's important to understand from that perspective is that while i do have many myeloma patients they are not the exclusive patient population i work with and so i'm going to talk about cannabis and cancer including cbd um in kind of the more general sense and definitely can talk a little bit more specifically about the common symptoms associated cancer and cancer treatment that are specific to myeloma as well as what little research there is about cannabis specifically in myeloma um but the caveat for all of this is always that um kind of the field of how cannabis and cancer intersect um is evolving and interesting and very very new and so we take that everything i say kind of with a bit of a grain of salt in terms of what is known so anyways thank you for having me um i'm going to first start by saying i have no financial relationships to disclose and i always like to start this presentation just to understand the technology it can be very confusing and people can use a lot of words interchangeably and so it's often helpful just to understand um what is meant by a specific term so you'll hear me say cannabis um generally speaking i know that a lot of people refer to it as marijuana but cannabis is the scientific species that we're referring to it is the name of the plant and you know some people will be familiar with the um subspecies of sativa indica and ruralis what's important to know is cannabis as a plant has evolved a lot in the last 50 to 100 years um basically as a result of understanding cross propagation and the movement of plants across borders etc a lot of the characteristics of each of these subspecies have essentially been bred out and so while people can refer to sativa in indica it it doesn't have as much clinical significance in my in my experience then the term marijuana marijuana is a spanish word for cannabis and essentially largely um designates the forms of cannabis that contain thc and i'm going to go into a little bit more detail about thc and cbd um but usually when people speak about marijuana specifically there is that idea of the part the types of cannabis that can cause a high um i won't use the word marijuana very much because it does have some negative cultural connotations um a little bit pejorative um but i will say when people talk about medical versus you know recreational cannabis or marijuana it is not there's no distinction between that but there's not different plants that are medical versus non-medical it really refers to regulation and manufacturing guidelines um that allow them to be sold in a medical dispensary so i just want to always make that clear it's not produced by a pharmaceutical company or anything like that and then i want to also reference pem so hemp is also cannabis so essentially cannabis sativa or any of these cannabis um that don't have thc are um so if you looked at a plant uh cannabis plant the ground you would not know whether it is hemp versus you know thc containing cannabis it's not visually obvious um essentially the hemp is whether it's hemp oil and hemp fibers that are used to to make pillowcases all of that it's essentially just cannabis plant that doesn't have thc in it and so it's not having the thc that makes it him lastly the term cannibinoids simply means the different chemicals that are in thc um they are the ones that have some activity at cannabis cannabinoid receptors um cbd cannabidiol is one of them thc or delta nine tetra hydra and i always forget the lab what the last um part of the c is um are all um uh are both um uh cannabinoids there are other ones that people often hear of or might read about cvg cbn thca etc those are just again other chemicals that are in the cannabis plant um these are significant because they do interact with our body um i often like to think of it cannabinoids kind of use opioids as a parallel so we often think of how um uh opioids you know interact with our body and that's because we have opioid receptors in that same way cannabinoids react to our body because we have cannibinoid receptors um and this is where uh i will tell you i'll give you guys a heads up through this i will make jokes and you may or may not receive them and i won't no because we are on a webinar so i hope this one is funny but basically you know the whole reason people ask me about cannabis because it has an effect on our body that's why no one asks me whether they should be smoking basil so all right so how do they even work why do we even care so there are thousands of cannabinoid receptors in our body um importantly two categories cb1 and cb2 are the ones we have the most information about cb1 receptors are the ones in the brain they are from the nervous central nervous system as well and then the cv2 receptors are the ones that are on immune cells we know that the cb1 receptors are very present in cognition short-term memory the basal ganglia which is movement and motor function and this kind of pairs well if you understand what thc um uh does right if anyone knows what thc's effects on the body are um they tend to lead to a high feeling well what is a high feeling it is you know decreased processing time or concentration affects memory and maybe affects a little bit of movement and motor function and kind of feel like you can't move as well now what's important to understand is having cb1 and cb2 receptors or receptors in general doesn't mean you won't know how it affects the person so everyone has different concentrations of these receptors just having them doesn't mean that when the when the drug or the medication or the um substance hits the receptor whether that means what the downstream effect is because our bodies are very complicated and that's particularly important the cb2 receptor the cb2 receptor is on immune cells and we don't definitively know how it affects immune cells which becomes really important when we're thinking about um one the therapies that are often involved in myeloma or in cancer in general and to the underlying cancers themselves so just to understand a little bit more about cannabinoids because it's going to form a little bit of foundation of what we talk about cannibinoids are um we have natural body cannabinoids so um i again i'll use the opioid parallel just like we have opioid receptors that you know if you hear those stories where someone um you know feels no pain when they're lifting a car off of their dog or whatever that's that kind of opioid like you're able to kind of or if you're an athlete like um you know performing through pain that's an that's a natural high right and the same way we have a natural cannabinoids anandamide and 2ag these are the two that have been discovered there may be more um in that same parallel phytocannabinoids so there is a plant version of a cannabinoid meaning chemicals that are in plants that have an effect on the receptors in our body we use opioids again as a parallel um that's the poppy plant that's the opium that i think of the scene in the wizard of oz where everyone falls asleep in the you know field of poppies and then we have synthetic versions of both of these so synthetic opioids are oxycodone methadone etc and then in that same way we have synthetic cannabinoids we do have some derivatives of thc that are man-made pharmaceuticals but there is no known um at this point there's no synthetic cbd okay so how do these cannabinoids even work receptor so that i always like to use this um kind of as a reminder medicine is a relatively new field you know like really understanding how different parts of our body work the the idea of receptors even is maybe 80 years old so it's important to understand cannibal receptors were only identified in 1988 1993 so that leaves us really early in the field of understanding how cannabis works but we do see that our natural panuminoids seem to have an activity in terms of pain movement eating behavior inflammation memory so we keep that in mind for a couple of reasons one because we do want to understand what we how we can work with our cannabinoid receptors um whether that is through cannabis um phytocannabinoids cannabis and cbd and thc or making new drugs are even more potent but also because it understanding what cannabinoids can do usually leads to different companies kind of making claims of what's possible with their cbd products and i always use this as a mo a moment for caution for example here you can see it's you know cannabinoids appear to have a role in bone growth does that mean you can say oh if you take cbd your bones will grow absolutely not we have none of that evidence basically what we can just say is the receptor is present in the bone and seems to possibly when you do it in a cell help with bone growth so just some background on cbd and why it's so interesting to us we you know in a survey by consumer um uh not this this survey i'm sorry it wasn't consumer remember those consumer reports it may have been a um clinical study in any ways an online survey um of uh 2000 respondents 61 responded that they used cbd for medical condition they've used cbd um more for medical condition than people who didn't who um who those who don't use cannabis recreationally were more likely to use cbd most commonly used for chronic pain and often using the oil form and a lot of people feel like cbd treats a medical condition just on its own very well by itself a consumer report survey similarly reports that 64 million um americans have tried cannabis i mean a cbd in the last 24 months and one out of seven americans use it every single day um this is pertinent also from a you know kind of access standpoint the cbd market is 327 million to 2017. it's projected to be 22 billion next year and there are 850 different products well there was a study of some of these cbd products and only 31 were accurately labeled and so it really is important to understand that you know hearing or reading about the benefits of cbd does not necessarily um equate to a safe product that you're going to be able to find out very easily and i very strongly suggest like working with your physician um or a experienced provider to really think through whether cbd or anything with cannabis could be helpful but there are um a lot of uh if we distinguish cbd from thc there's a lot of use of that as well we know that legal marijuana sales are predicted to be 23 billion in 2025 so similar to the cbd market um that in 2017 52 percent of adults have reported trying it and 44 currently use it currently current use meaning use in the last month and 14 use it regularly and 83 support some kind of legalization whether for medical purposes um even including medical purposes 49 um in a pool i want to say in 2019 said they approve um for recreational purposes and i i recognize that not there probably aren't many kids on this um presentation but i always like to say you know just to understand kind of the frequency of views that it starts young early um with uh 11 percent of eighth graders saying they've used cannabis in some form last year and that um amongst 12th graders um even six six percent said they use marijuana daily or nearly daily so so with all of that background particularly understanding kind of the controversy or the environment around cannabis cannabis use um you know it's it's always interesting to me the medical connotation to it in part because um i don't know that there's enough definitive research i'm gonna go through what we do have um but it feels like it has this weight on it as being incredibly beneficial from a medical standpoint without really understanding the other side of it there's a lot of perception of it being completely benign and better than let's say people be like you know it's better to use cannabis than to drink alcohol and i would make the point that both of those are recreational use and so using alcohol as a counterpoint it's not helpful because there's not many you know people who ask me whether they should be drinking um a shot of tequila as a part of their cancer symptoms right and so you're not really comparing apples and and apples right so but if we did look at the potential for cannabis for cancer-related symptoms the majority of the evidence falls in favor like favorably towards nausea the cb1 receptors in the brain has a lot of activity on nausea thc has more of an effect the reason for this is thc i compared thc to cbd in terms of its effect on the cb 1 and 2 receptors as thc is kind of like um if you had a dark board right cbd's like you know really are like a piece of art you're working on um sculpture cbd is like a little bit like a chisel is very fine work on the on the receptor um whereas thc is like a sledgehammer and so when we talk about this thc having more effects because it is a much more intense um uh affinity to that receptor so that means that for app for nausea for the really significant nausea that's often associated with chemo the difficulties with appetite that are often um uh associated with chemo there is much more effect with thc though some people will report benefit with cbd alone then in terms of pain again we think through the cb1 receptor maybe through um you know pain receptors as well is there some anti-inflammatory effect or the cb2 receptor um i've seen some studies of topical cbd having some benefit from peripheral neuropathy but it's still unclear and those that research is still ongoing um and then there is in um mice uh in my studies um there are some research around mood regulation and anxiety for mice there is one or two studies of high dose cbd for like social anxiety we're talking like 400 milligrams of cbd once for someone who's doing like you know state performance um it's really not a sustainable dose um there isn't as much for there really isn't much in terms of sleep for thc there's a little bit around sleep for cbd so the cbd seems to modulate some of the sleep wake cycles so again these are you know one or two studies each versus you know let's say the you know the intense number of studies you might see um even around you know the therapies you guys are receiving but even let's say zofran from nausea like that is a lot more done than let's say cannabis or thc is it's also one of the big things everyone's asking or wants to know because they read about it is people pop you know talking on anecdotally about you know using cannabis to treat their cancer alone like you will hear those stories um they're not validated stories unfortunately but um very appealing i mean when i i read them i i wonder and i and i hope and i wish but what we actually do know in terms of treating or preventing cancer itself there does seem to be cbd potentially in cell studies that maybe has a protective environment against tumor development maybe helps move medications um uh chemotype medications into i'm sorry are you guys still seeing my screen just kind of yes okay good sorry it kind of went off it's okay um um so yeah uh that maybe it helps the uptake of chemo medications into the malignant cells so that kind of deviates them and maybe is protective to the normal cell um the uh particular circumstance so that's for cbd um in myeloma i've seen some really preliminary research looking at one whether there's activity of cbd cannabinoids cannabidiol on cd2 receptors on myeloma cell lines and perhaps having some sort of effect on them some preliminary research also looking um again in a in cell studies of um um synergistic effect with vortezumin uh protestant map anyways one of the common myeloma medications i'm gonna say it wrong um so i think that there are people who are interested in that space but you know unfortunately the problem a lot of times with cell studies is when you're looking at a very single cell even a mouse model um the doses you're utilizing are not necessarily translatable to humans so for example if you're seeing in a cell study that cbd with um uh bor tesome let's say that that's the right pronunciation shows improved activity are you doing one milligram of cbd or one million milligrams of cbd which is not feasible for the human human um human being to take in and so these all give us um directions to move in but are not really translatable into doses for um anti-cancer now thc has been studied a little bit more as an anti-cancer particularly in a kind of a brain cancer called glioma gluon fastoma which um may be with certain chemotherapy so in cell studies and my studies sounds found to be potentially beneficial so one study of um like 20 people with thc and cbd in a preparation that's out of a pharmaceutical company in england did seem to help improve outcomes um for patients who are on their standard chemo regimen for this type of cancer for gluoblastoma was it curative no unfortunately glioblastoma is a very very serious cancer that is often fatal so um you know the prolonged survival but the point is like those are the types of human studies that are hopeful right like is this existing thing this um chemical that we kind of had around all this time have the potential to have even more benefit but i would say that that's also the reason why we can't put too many um eggs in that basket because cannabis has been around for thousands of years and been used for thousands of years and we haven't seen that decrease um the existence of cancer so we can't you know rely on it entirely um to be a kind of miracle in that way all right so it's helpful to know what's actually available so that i'm talking about all of this but sometimes it's helpful just know um marinol is one of the synthetics thcs mabillon is the other um which has actually was studied and approved for um by the fda for vomiting and hiv related anorexia so these were approved in the early 90s um you know a lot of a lot of studies went into allowing this to come to be right because um you know plant cannabis now is a little bit more available legal in certain states et cetera but certainly in the 80s 90s was not available and so it had to be made into a synthetic and it's a synthetic thc you know a lot of these medications for nausea and vomiting um i mean a lot of the thc based ones like the offset of that is the high and a lot of people who wanted to use this for nausea and vomiting found that the side effects of the high were intolerable like just too much to use the cannabis um primarily for nausea and vomiting so you will still see some people being prescribed and if so it's you know very thoughtfully done so but um you know oftentimes people don't have variable um benefit from it can a video is something that was approved about three years ago for rare seizures or so can epidiolex is the brand name it was um studied in pedia a certain set of pediatric seizures and so it's the only fda approved plant-based pharmaceutical extremely expensive if you don't have you know these pediatric seizure syndromes but what's helpful around both of these studies is the thc so um cannabis as medical medical cannabis the kind that you're certified for if you're in a state that has medical cannabis laws or allowances dispensaries has a combination of thc and cbd and so these these existing products these pharmaceutical products help us because we understand the interactions we're going to go into that in a minute but basically um knowing how things are have the potential to interact helps us you know think about what is this like how do we use safely use anything that is in the cannabis space and since we have this since we have the kind of video on the dranobinol marinol studies were able to say okay what can we expect thc would how would it interact or interfere with certain liver enzymes and stuff and then there's medical medical cannabis um and i'm gonna discuss that in a second cbd is a little bit different um so as i mentioned um hemp is defined as cannabis without thc and this allowed farmers and manufacturers to go be able to grow cannabis without having to worry about it being considered like by the drug enforcement agency as illegal right and so that allowed them to grow cannabis plants and use it to make fabric and you know oil for cooking and things like that um in 2018 the farm bill was expanded to say that sorry in 2018 thc was i mean uh cbd or hemp was taken off of the like class one drug and that's why cbd is available but it's not regulated other than epidealic no cbd products have been approved by the fda they have not decided whether it's a food or a drug or a supplement as such there's very little under um uh known in terms of the quality of the sources i mentioned there's 850 different brands it really is a role of the dice as to whether if you go to a store whether you're going to get a high quality brand because there isn't much independent testing there are a couple of different sources consumer labs a lab that tests supplements and so you know if i'm working with someone with cannabis or cbd we'll kind of look through and make sure we pick a product that has some third-party quality data the u.s hemp authority is a non-um non-profit organization that wants to impose some kind of standards and so has people certify for us hemp authority quality standard meaning of quality standards and the fda website will sometimes have some warning letters and test results for cbd related products one thing i want to mention is full versus isolated spectrum when something is full spectrum it means that the cbd product will have trace amounts of thc so hemp is defined as cannabis with less than 0.3 thc so a cbd product that is full spectrum can have up to 0.3 thc isolated spectrum is supposed to isolate out just the cbd and it's just you know helpful to know that lingo because sometimes you'll see a lot of advertising around that and not really understand what that means now cannabis certification now i recognize that i'm speaking to a national audience um maybe international i don't know audrey that's possible um so i'm speaking a little bit more specifically to um kind of the area i practice which is new york new jersey connecticut kind of spaces but recognize that each state has its own cannabis laws and you have to be thoughtful to that and well if this is something you're interested in understanding more about we'll want to investigate that further so in most of these states you need to have evaluation by a certifying provider if it is you are if medical cannabis is allowed so first start with which state you live in then a lot of them will need you to have a certifiable indication cancer is most often one um there are other medical conditions and chronic pain is and often in many states also considered certifiable indication um so you need to certify in new york you need to fight diagnosis like cancer and then a symptom that is associated with that that qualifies you then it comes down to how is it they're providing it some states they provide just little literal flour or the bud in others their plant product the others they'll kind of have distilled like in new york they um provide it as oils as vape etc and each of those formulations matters because their absorption is different and i'm not gonna um i'm nearing the 30 minutes and i know there's already a couple of questions so um i'm not going to go into that a lot of depth and i will always say caveat i'm giving you guys some general information it really is important that these these are not recommendations by any means as to what to take but i i will say i feel relatively strongly to not inhale the product because the understanding of how that affects the body is still not clear and people who particular cancer patients and myeloma are are have potentially immunocompromised and if you're inhaling in something and it's got a fungus or bacteria or something in it you're a much higher risk for some sort of complication related to that additionally i just recently saw some research come out saying that inhaled cannabis can also have significant inflammatory effects on heart uh related to heart disease so um i would again caution that inhaled is not your best formulation if you are con considering this conversation to have this conversation with a provider um in terms of getting certified and then dosing you know um you know oftentimes in the certification the um certifying provider will kind of work on um we'll need to give provide some guidelines to dosing but a lot of times um different states have it set up so the dispensary is actually providing you those specifics and so um you know working with a reliable dispensary is important um so again in new york state many people may not be on this call from new york state but again it requires you know initial consultation with the dispensary pharmacist making sure you're fully aware of what says on the labeling and i think this is universal across the country um because of the fact that it is not federally legal um can't thc contain the cannabis containing thc is dispensaries and companies um that work in that space cannot i think that it's like a federal law where they cannot use credit cards and so at least in new york state i think in other places you it is end up being kind of a cash or cash act type business um and something important because it's not going to be covered by insurance and you know the cost of both medications for the treatment cancer as well as the um uh managing the side effects it matters so um so just so you understand why dosing is so complicated um the a lot of places the uh the way it's labeled is they might label in concentrations like amount of thc to cbd and ratios in new york so they might really do it in percentages 22 2 thc 8 cbd so a lot of that like take is a lot of really nuanced um because you want to be able to understand exactly how much how many milligrams of each individual component you're taking in and especially with inhaled you don't really know how much you're taking it cbd at lower doses can be stimulant and so that can be really confusing um and then thc can actually um precipitate anxiety and so people who take thc for feeling like they're anxious and then get more anxious is actually a problem because the dosing is um isn't clearly labeled and people will think oh 30 milligrams doesn't seem like a lot but it might be for that person actually it's probably a lot for a lot of people and the other thing is what are you doing for so as i mentioned earlier on the presentation presentation there's a lot of different things that people are interested in it for but not a lot of evidence how to best dose it um it's only now we're getting more data particularly from countries where there is it is fully legal like canada and australia that we're getting a little bit more data on how to best dose it and so if you're dosing for a symptom um you kind of have some ideas of where to start but um it's it's still a little bit of like a trial and error and then the last thing i want to mention is what i was mentioning a little bit before around um interactions right so we're able to understand a little bit of a reaction interactions we do want to be aware of the fact that the cannabis is you know the liver enzymes do metabolize it because of that it can interact with other medications there's no clear maximum dose and so sometimes um because we don't have a lot of experiments to figure out what that max dose is and so you you just practice a lot of caution around the other medications that are being taken whether we think the cannabis has potential to interfere with them and this is only speaking about interference at the liver level there are a handful of studies of certain immunotherapy agents specifically what we call checkpoint inhibitors um nivolumab um ketruta you guys might have seen those commercials and there is some studies of that being used for other cancer types not myeloma like um lung cancer melanoma that showed that cannabis used with it in a population in israel um seemed to decrease the response rate to those so like i said you have cannabis thc and cbd potentially acting at what we call the cb2 receptors those on the immune cells well if you're also trying immunotherapy and we don't know how the cannabis interacts with the cb2 receptor are we actually blocking the way other medications work and so when i talk about um interactions i'm really talking about just the liver we don't have long term studies on some medications to say that there isn't an interference with um therapies um to be upon us so i'm gonna stop there i went over a little bit but hopefully we still have time for questions and i see that there are many but i hope maybe some are able to be pulled together no they totally are they totally are you're good so i would say thank you so much first of all for that presentation i i learned quite a bit actually as i was going through it um so i really appreciate you sharing that with us today if you want to stop sharing your screen so they can see you a little bit more clearly i'll start with the question that a couple of them have which is they're a little bit nervous you know walking into that dispensary where to start um and i know you can't give on an individual case-by-case basis nor give specific recommendations but what are general things that they should be looking for i like that you talked about no inhaling probably isn't the best um should they if they're just starting out for the first time should they start with oils should they start with edibles where where do they start um and how do they know proper dosing sure so assuming you've gotten so i want to be very clear i cannot endorse or support the idea of just going to a recreational dispensary and starting somewhere that's not but presuming you have a certification you're going to a medical dispensary i would generally say based upon the mechanism of action and how they are absorbed it is better to it would be better to work with an oil the reason for that is one an edible the problem that happens with edibles this is kind of well described in movies and stuff like that is that but the onset of action is one to two hours and so oftentimes people think that it hasn't had an effect and take extra and then it takes longer to clear it takes 12 to 24 hours to declare from the system and so you can have a hard time isolating out the benefits of it because you're just you took out took too much or something like that um so a pill or i and i consider an edible the same thing as a pill anything you swallow and then is processed through the liver so an oil tends to be a bit more predictable just because the absorption tends to be a bit shorter time frame and usually is cleared within six to eight hours and so you get a better sense of how it works the other reason i suggest or i i prefer to work with oils is because you can titrate the dose more carefully if you have a pill and you're trying to do a quarter of the dose like how are you cutting it to make sure it's so cleanly a quarter versus an oil if it's your you know the full dose is one full dropper full you can do one quarter of a dropper really easily and that would be the reason why an oil kind of from a dispense perspective is better i mean i think that you know we don't we when we become over the age of 12 we get so excited that we can take tablets and then some of that is the failing of the pharmaceutical industry industry to make um syrups more palatable but the at the end of the day like wouldn't we all like to figure out a way that instead of having to decide between taking um two advil and three advil could you figure out a way to take two and a half apple and wouldn't that be nice to just use a liquid right so sometimes i think it's kind of a shame that we move so quickly to tablets and also capsules can be like big to swallow and anyways i would say like an oil is a little bit of a better formulation because of the ability to titrate the ability to have a little more control i would also say i cannot again endorse a starting dose what i would often say is the dispensaries with you know understanding there's always exceptions dispensaries often start people at higher doses than necessary i think it is worthwhile to start very low and move up gradually because what you always want to do in these situations is think of what is the least most effective dose meaning overshooting doesn't have any benefit to you and only puts you at risk so if you can move into the right place gradually then you're better off because then you'll find that spot and also frankly from a financial situation be better off because if you are taking you know your dispensary gives you a 30 ml bottle and says take a full dropper every day or twice a day you're going to run out of that in 15 days because it's a dropper might be 1 ml you're going to get twice a day you wouldn't get to you know but maybe your dose would have been just fine at a quarter dropper and now you've got you've quadrupled your supply so i would just say kind of half if not quarter what your dispensary suggests if it's possible and then kind of move up from there very in gradual fashion and you know a good dispensary so the other thing i do suggest is no matter which state you're in however you're working through this is to kind of be be a good consumer buyer beware like you know if you're deciding between dispensaries don't just go for the one that happens to be two blocks away like call around find out what's within a radius call each of them you know use the very very good skills you developed being you know informed informed um like to even find your way to myeloma um crowd like you decided you wanted to be an informed participant in this process and so use those same skills call them see if they seem knowledgeable they're not just trying to push product you know as much as there's a lot of lore around cannabis and how like curative it is and it should be in the water supply or whatever at the end of the day it's a product that someone wants to sell and so just be just be like okay like you're kind of pushing these products a little bit heavy it should make you a little uncomfortable like it really needs to be about you so i will tell people like find the dispensaries that are within a region call all the ones you're considering make sure they seem reasonable make sure they have an ample selection in new york state i can make designations i can say specifically that only oils or only pills or whatever and so i'll always tell people like the ones you're considering make sure that they don't have like 50 different vapes and two oils because when i say oils only they're going to force you into one or the other you're not going to have a choice and so having a choice um means that you can be more nuanced in new york some of the dispensaries in addition to oils have powders and milk sprays and loss engines and all of those all follow that same category would i suggest those off bat first not necessarily but if you find a stable dose that's equivalent to a lozenge it's a perfectly reasonable thing to do but if you're at a dispensary that only sells two oils you know you you won't have access to them and so you know do the work of you know looking at what um other things are there yeah right after that it's just like you you have to kind of hope that the dispensary pharmacists form a relationship with them and have them also help you in terms of um guiding you in the dosing yeah definitely that was one of the questions you know if my treating doctor isn't knowledgeable or maybe not even supportive of the medical cannabis um where do i go you know and i so that's a complicated question so one you do want your oncologist to be aware because if there are things that change in your medical course you don't i mean the same reason why you wouldn't want to sneakily take opioids right like there's a reason you want your oncologist to know because if there's a change in your kidney function your liver function it's it may change how they approach your dosing of your medications and stuff so you definitely need your oncologists know if they're not supportive or don't know where to start most states that have a medical cannabis program um have a way to search for a medical cannabis provider that can certify you and so that would be that part of starting other than that there are some medical certifying providers that don't give much guidance maybe either they're uncomfortable with it maybe frankly that they just it's like a machine and they just turn them out i i know that exists um and so the dispensary pharmacist will often end up being the person that's the most helpful to that okay yeah and then in terms of brands you know you talked about there's 800 plus brands what are the questions that they should be asking or the research that they should be doing in order to find those reputable so in terms of cbd so i would say you know u.s hemp authority does have those certified companies and so if your provider is okay with you taking cbd and so you are looking to purchase it then i would obviously make sure your provider is aware and supportive of it is look at that u.s hemp authority because um they have like 50 different brands i thinkish that have sort of like are certified from quality standpoint the other thing you're looking for is very clear labeling some of them won't delineate how much cbd is in it and so just say hemp which again is just an oil and so if you're taking if it says 500 milligrams of hemp oil well that could have zero cbd in it and be like a whole teaspoon because it's just literally a weight right so you want to keep that in mind you also want to see that it's not like some sort of proprietary formula or adding a bunch of other things to it just because the last thing you want to do is use a cbd product have an allergic reaction to another component like you know they decide to fancy it up by adding um let's say curcumin and ashwagandha or something and then you have an adverse reaction and you don't know whether it's the cbd the ashwagandha curcumin so now all three of those things are unavailable to you so it's better to do something with anything kind of single so that you know your reaction to it more definitively it's not i think a lot of people feel like oh this has like eight really good i've heard eight all of these eight things are really great for me this garlic ginger curcumin mushroom cbd combo unfortunately one i would i would tell you i guarantee you if not sufficient amount of any of those sub components you're actually getting under dose on all of them and two that they're probably interacting with each other and you're gonna not really know isolate out which one is having the positive effect for you so if you felt a positive effect so let me just say make sure it's a very like simple product that you're just trying for that purpose and to ensure that it's very clearly labeled so you know exactly what you're getting that the dosing is clear because a lot of times they'll they'll label out um like you you have to do the math right like a label will say serving size is half a half a dropper but you have to do the math as to how many milligrams that is and so a lot of people the same way like your um your they used to have the big bottles of coke that just said it was very small print that the cert there were actually eight servings in there but it would be like 120 calories and you're like uh this entire bottle definitely has more than 120 pounds same idea you just want to make sure you really get a sense of how many milligrams there are in a serving how big the serving size is are you taking you know is it serving three drops or is it serving three hole droppers yeah yeah that makes sense yeah thank you um there are several questions regarding you know drug interactions and i think you mentioned all that we really kind of are aware of right now is liver there was um brutismive and thc that study how can people stay aware of what studies are being done are there clinical trials going on how can they stay up to date with the research that's being done right i'm not aware of clinical trials for cancer purposes and myeloma i know that there's some preliminary work i know of maybe a couple of cbd trials that are ongoing for solid tumors but i haven't heard anything be published from those from a symptom standpoint there are some trials i know people are working on looking at like cannabis for chronic pain cannabis for um or cbd for neuropathy etc i'm not aware of any like off the top of my head i'm hoping some of that starts to be published a lot of them are being done in other countries like i said um i think your best bet in underst in seeing that is really to i mean even i i just go to kind of pubmed and i periodically search um like i have an alert that comes to me that just says is cannabis and cancer and i see articles once you know every two or three weeks and i read through them i honestly like it it's a lot of frankly education to get to the point where i can read something very quickly and know whether it's worthwhile right and so it's easy for and i'm using this just as a proxy for all other morning shows it's easy for the today show to be like is cannabis the next cure for pancreatic cancer and just say it and then never have to delve into the depths of the research for it one thing that is helpful and i'm going to share my screen again just so that people can screenshot this because i do actually think that this is um a good they do a good job of um the mnc um ncbi is the national um uh center for bibliographic information i don't remember what the b and i are but basically it is a um nih and and nci um put together different information summaries and so they have a cannabis and cannabinoids patient information summary which summarizes and they update it periodically in terms of um information and so if there is new research um that is helpful the other one is so these are just two blogs that um i participated in and sometimes it's helpful because it simplifies it but msk has an about herbs um website which is is generally a resource for all kinds of different supplements and what exists in terms of cancer but we do have a cannabis listing so as new information comes up we try to update that but i would probably say this cannabis and cannabinoids pdq if you look up if you literally google cannabis pdq it'll pop up and um that is a really great resource i there's a professional version that i will send to other peers so that they're able to see it in kind of a really nice summary it talks about every level similar to what i um told you okay awesome um kind of just to go along with that really quickly uh we don't know cancer drug effects but do we know how it affects low-dose aspirin or blood thinners at all um sure so it shouldn't have an effect on low dose aspirin or blood thinners um i mean the thing about it is it depends on the blood thinner um a lot of the blood thinners have a lot of activity at the um at the liver enzyme at the various liver enzymes particularly warfarin which is very complicated in terms of the things so um like i said oftentimes your provider there's um a website that we use frequently called lexicon which we use to use drug interactions and if you put in marinol and epidiolex as proxies for cannabis they'll be able to see what kind of interaction it has with any kind of medication so um let me see if that's an i can just show you what that would look like okay oh it's it's being annoying because it wants me to be a subscriber and i have to do it through my um yeah it's having me do it through um so but basically there are all kinds of searches you can do for drug interact like drug interaction searches and you would be able to basically put in um marinol and epidiolex okay kind of video you wanna and maybe you can email me the link and i can send it out to them or something like that um so okay great um one of the questions uh kind of you already covered this but i think it's a great question is topical cbd oil helpful for neuropathy i think people are looking you know for solutions to anything empathy there are two studies so there haven't been studies in chemo-induced neuropathic pain there are there's one study of a general neuropathy i think it may have been diabetic neuropathy that looked at a topical cbd and did find a benefit it was a small study i will say i often consider using cbd topical because its absorption is relatively minimal so i'm not worried about interactions the same way it's well tolerated i cannot again endorse any products or anything but one thing i will tell you is again practice a little bit of the buyer beware there are a lot of products out there that will sell as cbd oils or creams that will have a very minimal amount of cbd so if you take a bottle like um three ounce bottle of lotion and it says 100 milligrams cbd well that's basically one milligram per milliliter it's a very very small amount and so just be really thoughtful honestly cbd um refining and extracting it is an expensive process so if something is amazingly cheap i would question whether it actually has whether it's successful yeah yeah like if you're if you're buying a 10 cbd lotion it doesn't it's probably not worth it okay and then it might make your hands very soft and i think that yes um one question that i wanted to make sure we asked is how do we know whether the product we're buying has mainly cb1 or cb2 receptors so it's not like that um the cbd doesn't really have as much activity on the cb1 receptor what it does is increase our natural amounts of cb1 i mean um our natural cannabinoids and so taking in cbd doesn't really have an effect on cb1 which only thc has effect on cb1 receptors cb2 receptors we just don't know like we don't know how much and what its effect would be on any individual person um but cbd tends to have more effect on cb2 receptors but plus minus um the meat how it that's the other reason why these like preliminary studies are so important is like we don't know the mechanism so while it could be cb2 receptors cbd also has effects on serotonin receptors it also effects on these vanilloid receptors which are part of like inflammatory pathways like we don't know through which mechanism it is potentially affecting or improving the circumstance and so when something is really complicated like that um you know targeting is the what exists right now is not is not specific enough to target like that that would be further research that is like a lot more isolated out yeah okay um we have one patient who's saying or one caregiver who's saying that giving her husband hemp soaks in for his feet has helped with his neuropathy um yeah what does what does that mean what is a hemp soak and what is required to do that so it would depend on what the hem so hemp is just the cannabis plant without the thc it would depend on what's the soap contains so if it's a hem with cbd i can imagine that being a little bit like a topical so there's probably some benefit to that the soak itself might be some of the benefit there's a hemp is that oil it may have it has hemp oil itself has a lot of omega sixes and nines and so maybe it's helping with some of the lipo barrier of the skin so that soap might actually help with some of this maintaining the integrity of the skin and that might be part of the components of the hemp that's helpful it would really be hard to tell unless you the hemp whatever product is being used in the hemp soak soap is um specifically analyzed for the components so a hemp salt could also literally be hemp plant right the same cannabis plant that people think about smoking or making into a brownie put into water well that hemp plant could have all kinds of things in it we just don't know in any cannabis plant any species varietal that you get you can have up to a hundred and up to six more than 60 different chemicals in it and so the composition can be very different plant to plant um so it's really hard to say and that's why i off i feel that much more uncomfortable with utilizing flower product or plant product as a part of therapy because you just don't have a predictable understanding of what you're getting and very very strongly feel um i'm gonna i'm gonna put this out there this the whole rso thing is very very concerning because people are given recipes to just buy cannabis plant plant and make their own oils without really thinking about the safety of that oil meaning like are you actually bringing in any bacteria or something concerning the composition of that oil so how much when you distill or bring out that oil how much actual of the sub components you're getting so i would just throw out there like anything you make at home [Music] i i would not do i i think you run a real risk there yeah yeah completely well thank you so much we'll just finish up one more time if you can just tell us the organization that rates um the cbd yes yes um it's the us hemp authority okay i'm gonna type that into the chat yeah us hemp authority is that and then if you want to type out cannabis pdq that's the information sheet from the government yeah pdq okay information sheet from the government that was amazing thank you so much for this presentation that was exactly um what i was looking forward to so i really appreciate you taking the time um i'm gonna finish up with just a couple outro announcements but thank you thank you so much um all right so i'll go through these briefly but while we're still working on the details we hope to bring you another highly anticipated topic which is navigating neuropathy with nutrition in january of next year and we will keep you with updated with more details as it gets closer you may be interested in other myeloma crowd community events we have coming up tomorrow is our african-american myeloma chapter um let me move this just in case it's blocking on wednesday the 8th we'll be talking about how to handle the holidays and enjoy our desserts and then on wednesday the

ya3prjHbi60,Medicinal Cannabis and Mobile Workers – What do I need to know? – Webinar,2021-04-22T03:00:16Z,hello and welcome to the natural road safe departure program webinar medicinal cannabis and mobile workers what do you need to know for those who are members of the australian institute for health and safety you'll receive five cpd points for attending today's webinar so welcome my name is jerome karzalek and i'm director of the national research apprenticeship programs the david next slide please and i'm responsible for its many activities to find out more please visit the nhp website register for our newsletter or even follow us on social media such as our linkedin page always welcome um today's session is going to go for approximately 60 minutes uh we're going to have plenty of time for discussion throughout and we're going to be recording it and it will be shared on the rsp website along with the powerpoint as well um so we love to make our webinars as interactive as possible so please send through your questions by typing them in the question box um we have gonna have two question points throughout this webinar to help inspire queries and and we really want you to grab them as they pop into your mind we're also going to be launching three polls to help inform our discussions as we go along um there's also a chat box feel free to comment um any thoughts or things as we're moving along and uh everyone will be shared the pdf and the webinar upon recording uh in 24 hours which will be emailed out so now over to our presenters and we have two today and we have associate professor david allen joining us welcome david thank you and we have andrew lee welcome andrew good morning everyone so just let you know who we have associate professor david allen is an adjunct associate professor at the university of new south wales school of population health he's also managing director of the drug and alcohol solutions australia and based out of sydney so to achieve this esteem david has over 30 years experience in occupational medicine as a leading authority on managing drugs and alcohol at his at the workplace and he has in-depth knowledge of drugs and drug use combined with a practical workplace focus which is going to make it really informative and compelling so it's great to have you part of this session i'm joining david we have andrew levy uh he is a working as a scientist and business professional in the field of workplace drug testing has over two decades of experience um andrew has presented and published a number of papers on the aspects of workplace drug testing in both national international drug testing forums and he's also a member of the forensic and clinical toxicologist association as well as a member of the royal college of pathologists quality assurance program and he's an expert in toxicology so two amazing presenters and i'm really looking forward to diving into this over to you guys okay thank you jerome um so we'll talk a bit a little bit about cannabis so um a plant that contains active substances um there's over 100 compounds being identified in in cannabis but the ones we're talking about particularly are thc and cbd today so thc is tetrahydrocannabinol and cbds can have a dial so they have very different um effects and and characteristics david sorry interrupt are you just turn your microphone up a little bit please or swing or david pat's swinging mic your microphone doesn't look like it's pointing to your mouth okay there we go how's that is that better much better okay thanks so um so what is medicinal cannabis so in 2016 in australia doctors started prescribing uh cannabis um uh cannabis compounds and most of these were in oils or capsules with either with thc cbd or or both most of these prescriptions were for people with pain conditions anxiety cancer symptoms epilepsy or nervous conditions we'll talk a little bit about you know what's approved and not approved in terms of medicinal cannabis because this is a significant um issue so most most products that people are using are unregistered drugs so prescribing we know in australia is probably well in excess of a hundred thousand approvals um currently certainly nearly that in february this year so in the left column approved use of medicinal cannabis there must be a prescription so a doctor's prescription is essential and there are several uh hoops that have to be jumped through to to obtain that the cannabis substances must be obtained directly from a doctor or a pharmacy and the the it must be provided specifically for that patient including the dose and why it's prescribed on the the second column not approved um is recreational cannabis so is a joint or hashish if you've sourced the source the material online particularly from overseas but it is not approved and um recommendations so some a naturopath or a doctor says you may benefit from medicinal cannabis but without a prescription it is not that is not lawful so in terms of the medical uses and effectiveness of medicinal cannabis so this is where it gets a little bit uh probably messy and controversial there's a lot of promotion of medicinal cannabis but based on what i would say is very little good evidence of effectiveness so we know that for instance with chemotherapy nausea and vomiting there is moderate evidence that seems to help um it's it's similar to the sort of medications you take for nausea and vomiting that are by prescription currently available i mean the characteristic of the munchies is is well described with the use of um illicit cannabis stimulating appetite and suppressing nausea so that you'd expect that to have an effect um there are some rare forms of epilepsy um where there's been a few case reports of um you know people with kids with epilepsy having a significant reduction in the number of seizures by using cannabis but that doesn't amount to actually sufficient trial data because the numbers are so small so it seems to have an effect but there's insufficient data to be conclusive about that severe pain it's people use it for that the data for that is is fairly sketchy and of low to moderate value nerve pain or neuropathic pain again the same sort of thing low to moderate data spasticity from nerve damage such as with multiple sclerosis again same problem low to moderate data and it's quite inconclusive with some studies showing no no benefit loss of appetite with chronic disease again moderate data mixed results um so in essence there isn't really compelling data uh for anything that it has certainly any major effect or dramatic effect so there's and there's a lot of papers that need to be done to demonstrate whether it is effective but in in summary that's the if there is a benefit the size of the effect for most patients is going to be modest or small so in terms of people who use recreational cannabis well we know in the top left reason for use this is all people who use cannabis so we know that the 77 um use it for recreational activity they they're not using it for a medicinal effect you'll see the blue segment um seven percent of people who use cannabis use it for medical reasons or what they believe to be medical reasons and another 16 use it for recreational reasons and medical reasons underneath that under usual source so um 50 people roughly say they get it from a friend 22 percent from a dealer another 27 so presumably that includes some people who grow their own on the top right prescription obtained so this is really important of those who say they're using medicinal cannabis so they report they're using it for medical reasons um 96 never get a prescription so then so we know by definition that's illegal illegally obtained only two percent always get a prescription and sometimes two percent so in essence the message here is that if anyone says they're using it based on that data from the aihw survey the likelihood that they get have a prescription is is very low but not zero um usage by age so traditionally expect cannabis users um uh for any reason would be younger but that's um in fact a substantial proportion are over the age of 50 namely 43 so there's plenty of boomers out there using cannabis i'll pass over to andrew for these slides thanks thanks david um and thanks to all our attendees yes so look a useful real world experiment of um what happens in terms of workplaces with the widespread use of medicinal cannabis is the us of course so they've really been on this road for a good 10 years or so now um and the little graphic on the left hand side of the u.s states uh indicates that they've actually gone a lot further than what's being proposed in australia so the blue areas are uh states in the us where effectively the cannabis has been completely decriminalized so you can go down to your local shop there's no need for any sort of doctor involvement and you can buy various cannabis products there that represents a pretty substantial proportion of the us population even though it's not the largest number of states the dark green areas are effectively what we're talking about in australia where there's a doctor's prescription and the light green areas uh a prescription is required but they're putting significant limits on what is able to be prescribed particularly in terms of its thc or that psychoactive component so what does that mean well we've got this nice um data set on the right hand side from from quest diagnostics which is one of the largest workplace drug testing laboratories in the world they conduct several million drug tests or tens of millions of drugs per annum in the u.s and this data set is over has over 60 million workplace drug testing samples in it so you can see it's a very very large number most of this testing it's fair to say in the in the workplace in the us is regulated in some way shape or form and what's interesting is although there's quite that patchwork of different uh regulations and and laws at a state level at the federal level in the u.s cannabis is still illegal so the regulated types of workplace testing that occur in the us are industries such as nuclear power industry or people associated with um defense contractors but by far in a way the largest cohort in here is under the department of transport testing or dot testing regime uh is triggered any time your any of your workers cross state boundaries in the us so that's truck drivers that's airline cabin crew that's sales people um it's a very very large number of people on the us that fall under this category and um drug and alcohol testing is a mandatory component of that and you can see hopefully on this graph from the period of sort of 2015 through to 2019 the purple magenta colored line which is the cannabis uh number of positives has increased from about 2.4 up to 3.15 and remember given that there are as i said tens of millions of drug tests conducted in the u.s every year this is equating to you know many hundreds of thousands if not millions of additional people that are testing positive every year uh under these regulated workplace arrangements and when you talk to companies in the us they will tell you that this is uh is becoming a a very resource intensive area for them from a from a management point of view and really broadly speaking that they treat it in in three ways um if you are from a state like california which has one of the blue states shown here that where cannabis is effectively deregulated um but you test positive on your workplace test then in most cases you only get one strike in the u.s system typically and there will be cause of dismissal for that individual now even though the cannabis is legally obtained in california their view is the companies will say well you can buy alcohol legally as well but if you're driving a truck and you're 0.08 on the bretho we're going to fire you and likewise if you're driving your truck and you're testing positive for cannabis we're going to fire you if it's uh someone who says it's for its prescription cannabis but they don't have a prescription again it's a fairly clear-cut system in the states but the grey area where people have got where obtained a prescription from their doctor and have got a prescribed dose of cannabis becomes very problematic for the companies the consequences of having workers repeatedly test positive on the dot regime is quite punitive in the states so that you can lose government tenders it can affect your the price of your insurance there's quite a lot of flowing on flow-on effects but dealing with those individuals what they tend to do is try and um first course of action is typically to try and speak to the individual to see if they can get prescribed a different drug for whatever their medicinal reason is for um for getting the cannabis if that's not going to work then perhaps you can try and re-reallocate the employee to a an office job but that's probably tricky to do with a mid to late 50s truckee who's been truckee for the last 45 years of his life putting him in an office role or perhaps other remedial actions along those lines but it is quite um a resource intensive focus and if i can have the next slide david um the other way of looking at you so that's that's sort of the impact on workplaces the other impact is is what is happening on the in the broader community sense so remember the us is talking about quite a significant increase in cannabis uh availability than what we are here in australia but what we are seeing is that when people are looking at at the state level over several years what's actually happened for the uh uh for the the states involved and there have been some interesting um findings so for example um hospital admissions to dealing with um psychiatric disorders have um drug induced psychosis and those sorts of things have gone up slightly which is not surprising um uh a decreasing number of hospital visits for for pain management people are obviously self-medicating using cannabis to reduce some of their pain symptoms but the one that's obviously of most interest to us is the fact that the the admissions to hospitals in most of these states there is a a correlation between the increased availability and consumption of cannabis in these states and the increased incidence of motor vehicle accidents in the hospital and and this is probably not entirely surprising if we think of alcohol as a good analogy here if we were to suddenly make um alcohol much much more available around australia you know you can sell it you can buy it in um servos and supermarkets and you know reduce the price and everything else um if we would increase alcohol consumption two three five fold in australia i would also anticipate we would see more motor vehicle accidents in that public hospital system so the us is further down this road as i said but it's not uh it's not uh without effect on on the on the entities involved i think we have some question time now we do indeed and i thought um and there's a question that caroline just put into the the chat so can please put any questions into the question fold that'll be greatly appreciated please um i knew this one was gonna be on the first ones that would come up so it does presence of cannabis on a test equal impairment though which is i guess one of the fairly easy questions yes no no it doesn't in essence um it it is it purely integrates presence just as uh certain other medications that are present in the system are necessarily impairing uh it brings up the challenge which we'll talk about later of what do you do if the substance is present and it's potentially impairing so that that's that's a challenge we'll expand on uh further caroline yep and i'll just share the poll as well so i'll put this up now because there's some interesting results sitting in here um so can everyone sort of see that now as well can you see that andrew and dave great yes yep so yeah so we just launched this poll we closed it out and um i think we had just over about three quarters of people completed it so thank you all very much uh what are your thoughts guys yeah well i think it's interesting because we are in the very early days of um the legalization of cannabis or correction the medicinal availability of cannabis in australia um and if we look at the the situation in the u.s it really took about it was about a 10-year journey between when this was first starting to be rolled out across a couple of the states to to get where we are now it really started in about 2010 in the us so we're only really been talking about this for the last year or two and one of those years is covered um which dilates all sorts of times but i wouldn't be surprised if we would repeat this seminar in uh several years time if we wouldn't perhaps see a bit more of a skewing towards the bottom i agree with that i think there's a lot of you know certainly we took about a hundred thousand people which i'm a huge number but you only need a handful of those in each workforce to cause a lot of uh grief so i guess this the message here is you need to be ready for this and preparing for getting your policy in place and that's and that's great because we'll be drawing a little bit later on and just a question for you david you were mentioning that some of the benefits and impacts uh and how all the data was uncertain it needs more studies it's one of the reasons why we're not through the data is not there is it because it's viewed as illicit or it's still sitting on the proofing we haven't been able to do the trials or thoughts around that there's a fair bit of research going on um and and it's interesting because the you know the cannabinoid receptors of receptors are well described in the in the body um so there's a lot of research going on driven by the desire to help people but also there's money to be made and so people are trying to make a fair bit of money out of cannabis um so i think that there'll be more papers come out mike my my feeling is that it's likely that most of it will end in um little effects um little benefits from cannabis um rather i don't i don't think there's likely to be any dramatic benefit and i i suspect it's a bit a little bit of a bubble we've seen those sort of bubbles happen before so um and i get i just know that there's one person i guess has actually had recently had an active issue so which is required resolution so like you're talking andrew it might be something we see more and more because from what i gather there's really only one state like acts the only one where it's really legal in australia is that correct yes but um because the att is also under federal uh restriction it's still illegal to possess cannabis even though it's apparently legal to buy it i think is how they had it explained to me so quite difficult um and one of the other complications is going to be and we'll get to this a little bit when we talk about some testing but the other aspect of course is the fact that uh it can be detected on a roadside drug test administered by the police depending on the type of cannabis that's been consumed so that may be something that will obviously be of interest to our um members given that um you may have a a truck that's testing positive halfway along the hume highway one night um and how's that going to be dealt with because the police won't care whether it's medicinal cannabis or not but if if they test positive then you'll be you'll be uh prohibited from driving that truck any further that's great i think um and i guess the one other question here like joel's want to hear how does the sensitivity of the testing used for a workplace purpose in the u.s compared to the roadside testing done in australia uh it's a very good question that their their saliva testing regime in the u.s is much much uh more sensitive so they have they talk of cutoffs of one or two nanograms per mill in the us and we're currently most of the roadside tests in australia are currently sort of uh 10 or 15 so so the us detection levels in oral fluid are much much tighter um for urine it's pretty much the same okay there's one one question on gout is that from steve diesel cannabis being prescribed feelings such as gout i mean there's certainly it's highly unlikely to to be helpful for gout but there are some medications and treatments that work extremely well for gout so um i yeah i can't imagine why doctors would be prescribing for gout unless they had severe protracted gout with major incapacity and it was a pain issue and and we have no questions coming through which we touched on a little bit later on around i guess that how it impairs you what sort of doing the different sort of levels in there but one question which i would grab before we move on um it's just from ron um he's asking are all police tests and processes the same across australia uh for the roadside saliva test um they're pretty much the same um the the sort of confirmation type procedure for want of a better term that the second test that the police are using um is largely standardized across the states i believe certainly the borrowed the laboratory testing point of view that the sample that you get you know a couple of weeks after the the result is is highly standardized and very tightly regulated um but the cutoffs are broadly speaking all the same although there may be some slight variation in the devices used just one last other thought when you was looking at the data and you were talking around the trends and things happening in the us i guess the other thing obviously there's a lot of american television and movies we see in australia and it's always becoming quite normalized there's less cigarette smoking and you see quite often people in all these tv shows movies saying i've got a prescription all the time now um so do you think australia could be maybe 10 years because obviously they're that tender do you think we're moving that sort of path well certainly the international um trend is towards uh reducing the restrictions around cannabis it's largely legal and unrestricted in most parts of canada now as well i believe so the canadians have really gone down that route of um that and that started with medicinal cannabis and now becoming increasingly um uh open slather and there's certainly talk in the in the uk of perhaps not uh totally decriminalization but certainly trying to reduce the penalties for cannabis consumption and use so so i think you know most countries are are on that spectrum but probably nowhere near to the same extent as the us at this stage excellent we've got a lot of questions i can hold on to the next sort of area and we'll begin touching on so let's move on okay so talk a little bit about the effects of of cannabis and the different compounds so and why it matters for workplaces so medicinal cannabis the thc effects now thc is as i said the intoxicating um uh component of cannabis so it does have effects on the body so it can increase the heart rate it can increase the the width of the blood vessels improving blood flow and some reduction in in breathing um and on the second column you'll see behavioral and psychological effects include so this is the this is the concerning area and this is why people want to use thc they get a euphoria or an intense feeling of well-being relaxation sedation sleepiness disinhibition so they'd be people more inclined to to act inappropriately that short short-term memory can be impaired distorts uh distortion of body and time and uh and an increase or perception that they have an increase in audio or visual or hearing acuity the ability to hear and see um so as opposed to ca cbd so it's not intoxicating even in substantial doses um there may be some benefit with the pain anxiety and nervous conditions that we've talked about before so it's not psychoactive so that the physiological effects it seems to induce sleep and and it may open up the airways and may have some role potentially in the treatment of airway diseases some of the behavioral psychological effects of cbd including include reduction in anxiety so this is one of the indications for cbd relaxation and note that it's non-hedonic so people don't don't seek out this this um cbd as a like they would a a drug that's um um that they might take recreationally so it's an illegal to drive in australia um if there is thc not cbd but thc in oral fluid or blood or someone has is intoxicated or under the influence of thc so it's just basically if the stuff is present in your system you're deemed to be committing an offence so that's that's the challenge you know if people say well look you know i'm not intoxicated and not everyone who's got the substance present is actually demonstrably intoxicated but there are multiple challenges in in demonstrating intoxication so it's effectively the presence of the substance is is considered to be um the offence and i'm i'm sure we'll get questions about that and happy to talk about it so in terms of impacts on driving we know from studies that have been done that that people with thc in their system will drive more slowly they will pass less past v equals less and they'll be establish a greater distance between themselves and and the car in front so in other words trying to uh avoid accidents but unfortunately they weave or in lanes significantly more so they tend to either go to the edge of the lane or or go out of the lane so we know that it is a significant risk for uh motor vehicle accidents and that's been shown in multiple studies some questions there excellent and we've got one coming up the top here i know we'll be touching on a little bit later on as well but um it's from christie and it's been like so thinking about drug and alcohol procedure should we specify that someone needs to have a prescription of procedure evidence that it was supplied by a gp or pharmacist sorry run that by me again jerome i missed that sure um thinking of a drug or alcohol procedure in an organization should we specify that someone needs to have a prescription and produce evidence that it was supplied by a gp or pharmacist uh well it depends on what your alcohol poli your drug and alcohol policy says and whether the per whether you deem that you've got people who maybe if they were intoxicated could affect safety or decision making so if a person's in in you know in an industry where it's not relevant um then there'd be no requirements it really depends on the context and what your policy says and what your objective is and is your objective to improve safety in a person's in a job that requires them to be not intoxicated then you would need to establish that you know people are educated to report that they may be taking your medication i will expand more on this in the next session and it's a nice segue jerome for our um panel next week on prescription uh drugs and driving and uh falls very much into the category there's a whole bunch of other prescription drugs which can have quite an effect on your ability to drive and we'll dive into those a bit if you join us next week i know i'm looking forward to that one as well so um and another question here so and there's probably just a clarification back for you um andrew earlier uh from domin is it dimitri in relation to the increase in hospital emissions of for motor vehicle crashes are these emissions showing the drivers also tested positives positive for cannabis so just sort of clarification sure yeah and um the the reference of the paper is at the end of the presentation so you can have a look yourself um effectively what it was showing was uh in a number of states there was a statistically significant correlation between the increased levels of cannabis consumption in the population and the number of motor vehicle accidents um in in the population that so that's that's at a state level uh over the course of a number of years so it's not not to say there's a direct causal relationship but there's a statistically significant uh link between those two sets of numbers and this is a great question from rob what is the difference between oral testing and urine testing regarding identifying the amounts in the system ah well i believe that might even be our next slide right coming up very soon oh no it's an infection i'll hop into that one in two secs sorry cool um and we've got uh one here from sharon i'll grab i have studies in relation to medicinal cannabis and driving involved patients who have prescribed medicinal cannabis by doctors results of such studies that could be quite different if undertaken with healthy participants compared to those who are generally unwell so i guess how does i guess regards to the medicinal cannabis and driving how's the health does the person's health impact on basically or affect how that person's driving or yes is the answer yes absolutely and and again when we talk about prescription drugs next uh week um there are actually a number of prescription medications you can take which improve your uh driving performance um because uh you know they're they're treating whatever your medical condition is and you're no longer in pain or you're no longer you know as distracted so you can actually improve your driving performance um look i'm not aware of anything that specifically looked at um people that are taking medicinal cannabis uh as part of a prescribed regime and how that's affected their driving before and afterwards it'd be very interesting to see but you could make an argument i guess that um like if someone was in chronic pain and they were getting some relief from their medicinal cannabis which i think as david mentioned is a very weak um use there's not a lot of data to show that actually happens but um it's like everything you know we cannot on an individual level there's no magic bullet to say whether this person is safe to drive or not you know even alcohol at 0.05 for different individuals is going to have substantially different effects uh depending on your fatigue levels depending on what other medications you may have you know it's a it's a very tricky one to pull up i mean standardized testing for impairment you know physically testing for it or psychologically is complicated and and impractical and if you could say someone was taking the medication at a regular dose and you could measure those the level of psychological impairment or physical impairment is that repeatable so is that the same today as it is tomorrow or next week so there's a whole bunch of variables that we really can't control for let's go we'll move on so i know quite a few other questions we've got sitting here now you guys will be touching on as we go through so so from business's point of view how do you manage the risk or how do you mitigate the risk so the first thing we've already touched on this is looking at you you need to really have the framework right your drug and alcohol policy so that your policy needs to and this is what you should be working on now referencing prescription and over-the-counter medicines not just illegal drugs and alcohol so you need to consider how prescription medicines um and over-the-counter medicines affect uh impairment and risk at work and how you're going to deal with them so it's it's wise to encourage people to confidentially disclosure and again you need systems in place uh to manage the confidentiality and that is you know regarding safety and and whether people should be put on suitable duties if they're taking any a potentially impairing substance and this could include cannabis or or narcotics or or um benzodiazepines and so on training is really important i mean the guts of this is you really need to look at how you train your workers to understand what their obligations are you know what is impairing and also what's legal and illegal in terms of cannabis so there's going to be people are going to pop up using this stuff and they need to be encouraged if if it's relevant to disclose and and so you can manage the risk you don't want them popping up as a as a positive on a drug test or having an accident and hurting someone i mean essentially what i'm saying it's it's complicated and it tends you get your framework right in terms of your drug and alcohol policy and then educate the workforce and um get advice if you're not sure i mean this this stuff is challenging even for health professionals so it you know it's it's it's not well understood in the medical community generally so if we're struggling with it um it's going to be even more difficult in industry i mean and i guess you can't you i mean it's good timing this because you can't just assume that this is all going to work itself out these people are going to be popping up and the last thing you want is for people to be getting hurt injured or killed um so um well do you mind if i just hop onto this one yes sorry david um because we've had a couple of questions about about uh the testing regime and it just it's relatively straightforward but there's certainly some nuances so remember we're saying thc the psychoactive component um drug testing programs will detect that okay so if their medicinal cannabis that they're being prescribed does contain delta 9 thc be it urinal oral fluid that will be detected and i'm including here now the police roadside drug testing and if you have a situation where there's been an accident in most states if there's a significant accident that requires hospitalization of one of the the parties involved there'll be a blood draw um taken certainly if there's a fatality there's definitely going to be that case um and thc will be detected and at the moment uh i'm a toxicologist not a lawyer but we have per se laws in australia that's david mentioned which means that um it doesn't matter if you've got a prescription if you've got thc at above detectable above the thresholds that are specified it'll be classed as a as a breach of that state's laws and especially if there's been an accident um it could be a significant component of that investigation where it gets a little bit different is when it comes to how you're consuming that medicinal cannabis and so again um if you are consuming it and you're having a urine drug test you're pretty much almost always test positive in that case um if you are consuming it as a as a tablet or as a pill or as even as an oil whether or not it detects uh on an oral fluid or a saliva test is probably a bit more of an open question it's certainly quite possible but it may not but in urine pretty much regardless whether you're smoking it eating it um having it in a cookie it's going to test positive there is some differences in how long you are going to test positive as well so um if even if you are smoking your medicinal cannabis um as we said in both instances your test positive uh in that in that instance but only for probably uh you know a few hours um certainly less than 24 hours on an oral fluid test um or a police roadside test um but potentially for a couple of days in a urine test in a workplace drug testing situation this is different though to cbd um so cannabidiol we're not testing for uh in a routine workplace testing arrangement it won't typically be detected uh on on a police roadside test um we don't even look for it in a laboratory-based testing and so the police won't look for that again in the example i used of a blood draw following an accident or a major accident or a fatality um cbd won't be looked for but just be aware of the fact that there are some uh possibilities that some of the metabolites of cbd may cross react on test positive on a drug testing device that would ultimately be a false positive because it determined it was cbd and not canada and not thc but it's certainly been an area of interest in the us okay hopefully that gives us a bit more context around the testing regime thanks andrew so how do you determine fitness to work how do you manage fitness to work well this is relatively simple um you just consider if thc is like alcohol opiates or sedatives in terms of its potentially impairing and that's how you kind of need to deal with it whether it's prescription or otherwise so the key points is um a thc not cbd so ce is not impairing th product cf products are impairing whether they're illicit or by prescription so they do increase the risk of accidents uh think of the thc products like alcohol opiates and sedatives they are impairing and potentially impairing there is an argument around you know is the person impaired at a low level of thc and some of them may be impaired some may not um you would generally in in health and safety circles support apply the precautionary principle and that is until you really know you assume that that you take a precautionary approach and so that's why the the tendency is to say well if it's present uh you we deem you to be in in breach of the law and and impaired um uh you could argue you could argue about that but it comes down to practicalities and and it's just very difficult to deal with it any uh any other way the presence as i said is indicative of potential impairment uh it's i mean there's a likelihood that we know that 96 of people who who say they may be using it for medicinal purposes are using illicit cannabis so in every likelihood if people are abusing this stuff um sources of medicinal canvas may be illegal and unreliable so people people can be out there saying i'm taking medicinal cannabis and they're buying it from a friend of a friend who makes their own oil and labels it as medicinal cannabis well that's not regulated and that's still illegal so really people need to be educated that you can't be assuming that just because you're using something that's allegedly medicinal it's going to be safe at work and it's not going to show up it will and it's it's illegal so it's important now to look at your drug and policy and start addressing this area because these people you know patients and workers will will crop up from time to time so you need to be ready for it and ensure that the your workforce understands the risks and implications of the presence of of thc in their system questions that's great one of those i'll share the results from the campaign then we've got a plethora of questions to go and i think a few of them had some clarifications drawing back from from previous points as well so i'll just share the results and welcome your thoughts what do you guys reckon i think there's um it's timely to probably start looking at your policy it really comes back to looking at the risk what sort of industry are you in so you do a risk assess assessment you know i mean if you consider alcohols a risk either in accidents or in people making mistakes or reputational issues for the company then thc's essentially the same and it'd be handled differently in terms of the way you test it and so on but other than that if you think that impairment is an issue then thc is going to be an issue would you agree andrew yeah i think so i mean you know from it's it's interesting if you look at uh there's a number of regulated industries now like for example if you're in the railways if you're in um involved in the airline aviation industry you're pretty much required to have a drug and alcohol management program in place most of the construction industry now that's dealing with large federal government contracts they are required by legislation to have some sort of dragon alcohol testing in place so um you know it's not as prevalent for us in australia as it is in the us but certainly um you know on a risk-based approach there's no question that illegal drugs and alcohol in in the workplace can have a significant effect on on the ability to work safely for them and others and the other thing i'd say is that that um it's good to get your policy and systems in place before this happens there's um it's quite um time consuming and problematic when these things arise and it causes major disruption to the workplace uh if someone you know is positive for a substance it's really good to have the framework in in place before that happens you're very exposed if you have got that framework in place because it's a little bit late there's been an incident and you're in a corona and coroner and then you put that in place and you all done that the question the corridor so it works great why wasn't it in place beforehand yeah well you yeah if you're aware of it as a potential issue that raises the issues of negligence and so on and just a comment here from ron um he said frank uh fyi i understand the presence of illegal drugs primarily cannabis following uh sorry just moved around then um following road crashes uh essay law requires blood tests must be taken if admitted to hospital fatalities which now exceeds um alcohol yeah yeah the the the testing uh rates or the positivity rates from south australian police on their roadside drug testing program which as with most states uh is not a random um roadside drug testing campaign it's very much a intelligence-led campaign that the police use to target certain areas and certain times and everything else but the positivity rate on drugs is much much higher than what they get on alcohol you know you typically get sort of round figures half a percent of everyone you test positive uh driving around on a friday night in the road testing positive you know great at 0.05 uh a number of police jurisdictions around australia will report eight nine ten percent positive uh for thc and methamphetamine on the road so you know an order of magnitude um greater uh rate of positives and two sort of questions that align um spacey ron and john basically um will generally only which will generally only return a positive alcohol test when it compares you certainly 0.05 or higher how does this relate to cannabis um and john's is very similar should candles be viewed differently if you have a 0.05 or above for alcohol i'm not sure i understand the question that doesn't uh will generally only return a positive alcohol test when it amp so i guess if you're 0.05 um anything below 0.05 and alcohol doesn't register or there's no enforcement so the question would be around impairment so if you're impaired how do you measure that and i guess john's made another point here going if you if you test and there's that impairment level should there be some further testing to see whether you are actually impaired whether you're not well i think that it comes back to as david mentioned about the risk um because you know it's not 0.05 if you're driving heavy vehicle for example and that's because the risk of having an accident starts increasing the moment you have any amount of alcohol on board so you know the risk of having a motor vehicle accident at 0.02 um is about 30 or 40 percent more than than being sober and the risk of having an accident at 0.05 on the breath oh this is on population level of course is about double so and then it becomes more like about three or four times at 0.08 so so i guess the question is if you know where do you set that level of risk and the australian governments collectively have said well we know that any presence of cannabis is a potential risk for driving so we're going to set the limits at a certain level and anything above that is going to be a positive i mean it's important to note um that the even at that blood draw level following a an accident um the the state forensic services are not looking for the tiniest little plank uh shred of thc they will have their own limits and it's got to be above a certain level and that does vary a little bit state by state but that's to try and exclude the fact that somebody may have had a joint four days beforehand and it's got this tiny amount to kicking around in the background um so there are levels that are sort of used to try and get around that but i guess it comes back to risk any anytime you have the presence of thc in your bloodstream or in the ability in your bloodstream i'll say there is an increased risk but that might be a small increased risk but that may not be something you want to take if you've got many many hundreds of trucks on the roads doing many millions of kilometers a year um that could be significant hmm sorry and what happened so if someone's actually importing or ordering drugs like medicinal marijuana from overseas and it doesn't have the thc in it it's being brought in is there risk to them doing that well they're importing it yeah you're ordering it's illegal yeah prosecution you have to obtain it you have to obtain it from a doctor or pharmacy it has to be with prescription and how many people do you think are probably even aware of that risk from that side uh i don't know i haven't seen any data on that but i suspect well there's certainly a lot of people if they don't know they're certainly doing it um that comes back to educating the workforce about what's legal and what's not legal yeah same sort of thing actually a useful analogy there is with sports supplements yes um you know a lot of people will say that they can buy it online for much cheaper than they can buy in australia but then they often find the contains uh they can sometimes find that contain substances which are illegal in australia like um dmaa for example um and you can be prosecuted for doing so but i mean i guess i guess the idea that you know with regard to thc and and and prescription and over-the-counter medications it's wise to get your workforce to behave as if they were an athlete you know and you see professional athletes and and olympic athletes and so on they go into a pharmacy that they are very very careful about taking anything that's over the counter or from a doctor so they have a card saying you know i cannot be impaired and these are the things that you know anything that's impairing can't be used so that those are the sorts of things you need to think about so that your workforce doesn't inadvertently take stuff that's going to be impairing regardless of whether it's thc that's like a question here from karen sort of touches that point if you get a false positive for thc because you took a doctor's prescribed cbd would you still be done for drug driving or would the follow-up test show that it was that it was a false positive yeah so the subsequent uh laboratory testing level would be um uh exonerate you and that and false positives occur on the police right side testing um with some degree of regularity they're a bit low to give you exact numbers but it certainly occurs um for a whole there are a couple of other um potential medications that could cause crossover activity and that's events as well so that that second level of testing but that won't uh help you in if it's a positive on side of the road the police will initially do a test uh if that's positive then you're typically taken into the drug bus to do a second test on another instrument which has a um allegedly a bit more better performance and then if both of those are positive then they won't let you drive for a period of time but subsequently the the laboratory test which comes back up a week or two later um would uh mean that you're fine in that sense if it was if it was just cbd and kathleen makes a point here going on our gas urine test now the cutoff is 50 i think it's micrograms the u grams per liter therefore they could have a little in their body it's 50 micrograms per liter or above considered under the influence then not in the urine test it's that i'll refer to david here but but um we're very we're trying to be very careful to say that a positive on any and any type of test urinal oral fluid you can't use that you can't say the person is impaired because they tested positive um all you can say is they've got the presence of that drug um it's indicating the presence of their drug is present so um the urine levels particularly really have no relation to uh two into impairment or even very difficult to know what it means in terms of how much when people may have used thanks for that and we have a question here from um from john scanning over has set percy levels should we follow this model i'm not sure what they are i guess there's a bit of an assumption that you guys know what they are as well um well a couple of european countries have actually started to introduce that have talked about introducing per se limits which is what we're saying is what we have for methamphetamine and thc here whereas we're not trying to talk about impairment we're just trying to say once you get over this limit then you're positive right a correction then you then you're deemed to be uh conducting an illegal activity effectively you know you're positive for thc we're not going to argue about whether you're impaired or not you're just going to get a fine um some european countries have been debating for quite a while about whether or not they need to do that with some prescription drugs as well in particular things like opiates and some of those sorts of things um it gets pretty tricky because the only way you can realistically do that is with a blood test much harder to test for on the side of the road at levels that would be of concern um and we just have a comment here from sharon thank you in victoria the drugs which are part of the roadside drug testing regime have been included because of their demonstrating involvement road crashes in victoria thc is presence in approximately 15 percent of driver driver rider fatalities um so that's probably my view uh david from carmel do gps and farmers have a duty of care to advise the impact on driving upon prescription if so how is this regulated do the products come with sufficient warning so any any impairing substance should have a warning on the on the packet in fact it does so uh and that the pharmacist should routinely tell you that doctors should tell you of course as well not all of them do i'm sure um i mean one of the challenges is yeah out there people are getting prescribed all sorts of substances that are impairing um [Music] and a lot of doctors don't necessarily ask them what sort of work do you do so you know you say i'm a crane operator well a lot of doctors may not even know what a crane operator does or a forklift driver the risks associated so in a lot of busy medical centers don't ever take an occupational history so they don't know what a person does so you you really need to assume that that that the people have not been advised necessarily by their doctor that the substance is impairing and hopefully they're captured by the pharmacist um but you know people are going to slip through than that or they're not going to listen or they'll although i think doesn't apply to me i'm fine that's probably really good point that one on actually if you're going in dealing with gps and and pharmacists ones that actually probably know your industry segment if there are some of those sectors that recommend gps to go through because actually know the drivers and the sector you work in um if a person drives on thc is there an onus on the doctor to report this from john um if it's not legal i mean report it to whom i guess um to the workplace uh i think their obligation is to their patient first and foremost but it's prudent to tell the people to tell you know to find out if their impairment may affect their work but it's a very muddy area um so i don't think you can assume that that will necessarily happen in fact you can assume it it might not happen that's great um one other one here from kathleen do we know whether the majority where the majority of insurers stand with regards to accident where medical cannabis was taken will it impact on the repair being possible well i would have thought liability if you got an uh an intoxicating substance on board would be the same as it would be for alcohol um you know you might you may not be covered i'm just going to share the results from our last poll here we go um so given the information provided in today's webinar how would you describe your thoughts going forward um so 30 percent can't really see we need to taking action in workplaces yet the majority of people sat in the middle we need to actually look at our policies and procedures as part of the ongoing reviews and i guess in the final one we are looking to influence strategies to amend police so uh what most people said what are your thoughts guys well i think it's a i think it's a good idea to be reviewing your your sort of fitness for work and drug and alcohol policies kind of regularly anyway i mean this is a fairly fast moving space there's new um standards that have come through recently for oral fluid testing which may impact your you know your policies um and we'll be talking about prescription drugs next week as well and and you know if your policy is five six seven years old it's probably well and truly time to um to have a bit of a look at it and you know they're no good if they're just sitting on the bottom shelf um gathering dust i mean i guess the other thing is that you know i talk about training and you know the workforce certainly a lot of people in the workforce would be aware of this so to be to be able to effectively handle the uh positive drug tests in the workplace and um you need to have your workforce regularly updated on what's going on the toolbox talks you know e-learning etc letting them know what their obligations are that that's an ongoing process and the case laws has shown that if people don't do that people can say well i didn't know it was seven years ago that we did the training i forgot so this is an ongoing commitment you need to to to do to to keep your workforce informed and and um you don't want them to be aware of it and you you're not be aware of how to deal with it and um great comment here from sharon increasing awareness amongst health professionals of the elsa rhodes fitness drive guidelines it's important it has relation to medical conditions substance use treatment and driving and also work requirements so i'm great resource there for people will be pointed to that's a very good point um question here i think john's just throwing it out into the uh the chat thc detective does not equal impairment wire impairment tests not required any thoughts what what impairment tests were you considering john yeah just sorry john that'd be great i mean in in essence it's it's impractical uh and it's really a matter for the regulators um the same thing for prescription drugs opioids and so on how are you going to handle that um impairment tests are not are not straightforward either and or consistent so are we really talking you know about a very challenging area well and the other and and that's quite true and i mean the police will do sort of roadside assessments in the u.s where they do you know much more sophisticated than walk the line but they typically take 30 minutes to 60 minutes to do and it has to be done by a highly trained professional and whether or not most people are going to be willing to wait for an hour on the side of the road while they're being asked a range of questions but a simpler point is just that's the law the law in australia in every state is you cannot drive your vehicle while you have thc on board and you know there's no mention of impairment it's just the fact if thc is present it's a breach and that i'd add to that i mean it it it it's a matter for the regulator i can understand why they wouldn't um do those impairment tests because they are time consuming and and they're by no means uh reliable um but the second thing is if people really need thc and have demonstrated they're using it for a particular indication the number remember what i said about the effects of it a pretty um pretty scant evidence of any benefit so if they there's a really compelling need for it so be it but i think that's going to be the majority of people who are taking it to be honest and it's for some conditions it's the third or fourth line treatment they have to fail on multiple different treatments so the first thing i would be doing is talking to the the treating doctor about you know what why why it's indicated what have they done what other measures have been taken to to help them if they really really need it i suspect the majority of them um probably are getting little or minor degree of benefit or no benefit from it so it begs the question why they're taking it and whether there's actually alternatives that are safe as it would with any other drug if a person's taking you know opiates oxycodone for pain most of the people taking oxycodones ongoing for pain um shouldn't be that that's and that's clearly evidenced by the the the epidemic of um oxycodone deaths all right so what a fantastic answer in both you saw closing out i think it was really good like let alone pointing it and those other sort of components in it so it was great so thank you both so much for your time today and i think it's also a good promotion that next week if you've got next slide please um dave and andrew i'm sorry that's all right i think it's worth recognizing our two great presenters today so if you want to reach out to them please there's their content contact details a wealth of knowledge and experts you can sort of draw on um and they're happy to sort of chat as well um as you mentioned next week we're going to be doing um another webinar on prescription drugs in the mobile workforce how can we assess and manage the risk uh and i think you can sort of see how we've sort of gone through there's no way you could squeeze this all into uh into one webinar this is just a hot topic in itself um so thank you guys very much for today thank you thank you very much very much for everyone and we'll be sending the webinar out there'll be an email coming out um in 24 hours we'll link back to it all we had a couple of questions we didn't quite get to so i'll follow up with um with david and andrew and do that as well so thank you guys very much and i hope you can join us next week as well thank you thanks everyone
K_AlVaBP2kA,Ep 5: Pain management and medicinal cannabis,2021-06-02T14:00:11Z,warning this episode talks about suicidal ideations and addiction this may not be suitable for all audiences listener discretion is advised everybody has experienced pain it could be a dull ache it could be a sharp stabbing feeling but imagine the kind of acute deep-seated pain that's not only hard to explain but it never goes away it was getting to a point was which is quite frustrating because the patient would come back to you time and time again you try something else and it wouldn't work for them for this episode we talk about pain management about bringing medicinal cannabis into the wider sphere of pain relief the canadore co-founders dr david feng and kevin babrezen david is kanadoc's medical director and kevin is the director of operations i also spoke to dean taven he has had a c4 spinal cord injury for the past 33 years and has been on his own journey for the past 16 years to fight his ever increasing chronic pain yeah well how how did it start exactly well i think i went to maybe it was back in early 2019 i went to you know a hemp expo in melbourne here at the expo center i think i talked to some people who had used medicinal cannabis and they were saying you know what great results they were having yeah you know i was friends with david and created this website called canada i showed it to david and then i think david you were actually at that time just uh discovering uh uh medicinal cannabis yourself weren't you and i think you had a really good response with one of your patients and i guess the stars the stars had just just aligned there i've been in general practice for almost a decade and i've been seeing a number of patients with um chronic health conditions that weren't responding to traditional therapies and it was getting to a point was which is quite frustrating because the patient would come back to you time and time again you try something else and it wouldn't work for them and you know the very first patient we tried it on well i tried it on before we started canada was after kevin had suggested the idea of medicinal cannabis for me because i didn't have any idea about medicinal cannabis and i didn't know how to describe it how to access it for the patient and didn't really know the therapeutic benefits of it so when i when this patient came to me you know and i'd been sitting here for a number of years before this and she was at the end of her tether basically she told me that you know look um i'm 77 now you know i've tried everything under the sun for my chronic back pain my fibromyalgia my you know peripheral neuropathic pain and nothing was working and i you know almost felt like we the medical system had failed her and so i decided to investigate a little bit further on on kevin's advice to look into medicinal cannabis a bit more did some research and then got back to this patient to try medicinal cannabis for them and we only actually just tried cbd which is very very safe generally and um she had an amazing response basically her pain went from a 9 out of 10 to a 1 out of 10 within three weeks phenomenal stuff she had zero side effects and it basically absolutely changed your life you were originally prescribing people i guess prescription pain medication unfamiliar with the concept but also cbd what is the difference between cbd and medicinal cannabis yeah so um i guess when we talk about medicinal cannabis we talk about the overarching cluster of different medications that the cannabis plant can produce and there are well over a hundred cannabinoids in medicinal cannabis that have therapeutic benefits cannabinoids are compounds found in cannabis you may be familiar with the most popular cannabinoid now let me try and get this right phytocannabinoid tetrahydrocannabinol or thc which is the primary psychoactive found in cannabis so when we talk about medicinal cannabis we talk about the whole cluster of medications that we can derive from one plant and when we talk about cbd cbd is actually just one cannabinoid that's derived from medicinal cannabis you know when we talk about medicinal cannabis from a pharmaceutical perspective we tend to only talk about it in terms of cbd and thc the reason for that is thc is the most prevalent um cannabinoid in the chemist cannabis plant and then cbd is the next most prevalent so we tend to only talk about those two but as we learn more and more about this plant we learn more and more about these other minor cannabinoids we're going to find that there are sort of exceedingly good benefits from from these other compounds as well so when people might be unfamiliar with medicinal cannabis and might have some reservations a lot of people might think that it is on par with recreational use of uh marijuana what do you say to that that's one of the biggest hurdles that people have to get over in their minds we know medicinal cannabis and recreational cannabis are very very um different things when we when we talk about recreational cannabis most people use it in its high thc form and some people enjoy that medicinal cannabis on the other hand the goal of medicine cannabis is trying to achieve therapeutic outcomes like pain relief reduction anxiety improving sleep that sort of thing without causing a high we can sometimes use products that contain thc medicine cannabis but if we get people high actually we're doing something wrong okay because um we we hope to achieve a threshold of therapeutic improvement before we get someone to that euphoria stage which can be a huge issue i mean was your patient the 77 year old lady was she also a spinal cord injury patient or was this somebody who just had chronic pain yeah this this was the very first patient i'd seen for medicinal cannabis and she didn't have a spinal cord injury she did have um neuropathic pain though she had had a peripheral neuropathy of unknown origin basically essentially she'd gone 30 years or so with this burning nerve pain in her hands and feet and she'd done every investigation under the sun you know she's seen multiple neurologists she's you know nerve conduction tests she's done all sorts of um uh scans and things like that and no diagnosis was made but essentially just got this you know severe pain in her hands and feet and tended to be worse at night time and kept her from sleeping just makes it essentially very depressed and um initially she got it made her suicidal after a few decades which which is very common we see that a lot you know wears people down mentally and physically and causes severe depression as well definitely had symptoms similar to patients who have suffered spinal cord injuries because a lot of a lot of our listeners who will be listening to this is majority spinal cord injury or family or friends of people who know somebody with a spinal cord injury and probably understand the levels of pain and because it's medicinal cannabis is so new to the market prescription medication has been prescribed for so long what gaps in australian medicine do you feel we're there that aren't meeting patient needs yeah that's a really good question um the biggest thing that i feel like medicinal cannabis is doing for patients is it's actually activating many different areas of therapeutic effects rather than just a one say if you take opiate medication you know your morphine your fentanyl tramadol codeine whatever they tend to only activate one set of receptors in the brain and the in the central nervous system so it's not a very holistic medicine you're targeting one area to try and dampen down nerve signals or the the perception of nerve signals in the brain um you're hitting it really really hard with a lot of intensity when you do that you tend to get a lot of side effects from it so as we all know you know opiates can cause sedation constipation um it can cause dependency people tend to become more and more tolerant to it and you need higher and higher doses as well and and then down the track you know you may get addiction potentials so that's just obvious for one example but there are other medications that we use for say chronic neuropathic pain that also tend to only hit sort of one one set of receptors and and don't really have the holistic approach to to medicine they tend to create a lot of side effects but my experience and this is just what i've seen is that the therapeutic range for medicinal cannabis is very good like so most patients do get some sort of benefit from medicinal cannabis and the side effect profile is much better compared to say opiates or benzodiazepines nerve pain medications that sort of um class of medication so i've not yet encountered a better class of medications from a benefit to risk reward ratio we deal with a lot of chronic pain medications that have very very high risk of developing side effects and sometimes toxicity as well so we know that you know there's a bit of an opiate crisis across the world um and and that's kind of hitting australian shores as well you know a lot of people unfortunately die of pharmaceutical overdoses when it comes to um particularly opiates and a lot of these a large proportion of these are from patients getting prescription based medication uh it's unfortunate but the medical fraternity has to take some responsibility for this as well that we're getting patients using medications that essentially isn't always the best one medication for them for from a pain perspective because you know constantly knocking on just one receptor most people are bound to develop dependency intolerance to these medications over time in contrast from from those traditional therapies to medicinal cannabis muscle cannabis tends to work on multiple different areas of the body targeting mainly the endocannabinoid system so if you activate those receptors and hold in a whole bunch of areas in the body you're going to get a whole host of different therapeutic benefits like reducing pain reducing inflammation reducing anxiety people tend to sleep better with medicinal cannabis but generally feel a little bit better in themselves as well um and and the safety profile is actually very good for medicinal cannabis you can't actually cause someone to to take a lethal overdose with um uh medicinal cannabis this has never happened before from a direct overdose of cannabis i mean um yesterday surely you can make them feel a bit unwell from the side effects but you can't actually induce a lethal dose i have to say i'm you know i i don't want to come across as as spreaking this medication obviously i've done my research i have to say that doesn't work for everybody okay like just with any medication doesn't mean like one size fits all for any everybody it needs careful titration you need to find the right concentrations of thc or cbd or you know other cannabinoids out there that might be beneficial for the patient so it doesn't work for everybody but for the people it works for you know they tend to get very very good benefits yeah and that's very interesting considering the criticisms that can come with people who are unfamiliar with the concept of medicinal cannabis one man in this virtual room who's been silent for quite a long time dean's is one of your patients who's had success with it so uh dean um do you want to give us a bit of background on your disability and how pain has had affected your life yeah i've been a c4 quadriplegic now for 33 years this chapter will come in january became a c4 quad at the age of 13 after falling off his suspension bridge uh i've had a fair bit of pain more so in the last let's say 15 16 years of my uh disability and i had been david mentioned one of the opioids that he mentioned uh tramadol i've been on tramadol for 16 years they had been told by my gp that i had to basically stop them because of the high suicide rate that was happening and with the opioids and so forth like david also mentioned and that they were coming under a different category yeah it was a lot harder to get tramadols and so forth and i'd had to see his buying specialists and was going to be a lot harder and i mentioned the um medicinal cannabis to my gp and he said it's something you can try and uh yeah which we did and here we are today which i was on i was on quite a high dose i believe don't quote me on this but i believe the maximum dosage for trauma dollar is 400 milligrams per day um i was on 300 per day for 16 years um i slowly weaned off that uh and i'm not i'm not taking any tremolo rule and haven't been for quite a few months now uh since i've been on the medicinal uh cannabis yeah when you're approaching pain management and and you said you were taking it for 16 years what actual could you just describe the type of pain that you were in just so our listeners get a better idea about um what chronic pain means to you with me being a c4 c well c4 complete c5 incomplete quad um with my pain it acts very different because i can actually say i'm i'm in pain per se in my lower back i can't feel that uh pain if you will however my body does respond in a different manner and it'll i'll get like really really bad muscle spasms in the abdomen in the legs to the point you can't even go out because if you do go out you're gonna you know slide out your wheelchair carriers need to slide your back and stuff especially uh if you can't do it yourself like in my case and then you've got issues with profuse sweating and that's the one thing that i just couldn't stand um just feeling uncomfortable always cold no matter what the temperature was outside even though the pain look might be coming from my lower back pelvis or wherever i don't feel that pain per se however the body does react uh in a different way letting me know that there is something wrong somewhere else and i think that's some something that people need to consider when they're talking about pain management because pain is actually a life runner for a lot of people can affect actually everything in your life so i guess for you dean when you're unable to go outside because you might spasm or the profuse sweating or feeling cold as a result of the pain it really puts a dent in everything without a doubt the quality of life just becomes yeah basically non-existent i mean i mean i'm still learning i'm only i've only been on it for uh yeah relatively short time so i'm still learning and like david said it does take time you know what's right for you and the amazing thing is too that i find is with the medical cannabis even with a high thc content i don't get that head high it's more a body high if you will or just relaxes the body so the spasms stop within one to two minutes it's unbelievable so i guess this is what you're talking about david when you say that the effects actually are unique to everybody exactly exactly so um we know that there are multiple different formulations out there uh we know er you know formulations that are ingested like oils or capsules and things like that they tend to be longer lasting but they have slow onset of action for people with a lot of chronic pain or chronic symptoms throughout the day we'd probably prefer to use an oil or or a capsule just to get that sort of slow relief most patients will get about you know on average six to eight maybe eight to ten hours of relief per dose but it takes about 30 to 19 minutes to start working if you're you know someone who needs uh relief quite quickly so you get acute muscle spasms um like dean would get or if you get like acute on chronic migraines then you may want to use some fast acting like a flower you know if you were to vaporize a flower through a special device medical device called a vaporizer then your onset of action is much faster you get an onset of action within you know one to three minutes sort of thing and maximum benefits by about 15 minutes dean is in a unique position he has he's tried both he's probably someone who might be able to speak of you know the different effects of when he took the oil versus when he took the flower as well with the oil i did find it a lot it did last a lot longer it but however it did take about for me it took about 60 to 90 minutes before it actually kicked in i just found very i found it very dry i was getting dry in the mouth but it did work for me in the evening i found just still sweating so when i was having the vape that stopped that eliminated that pretty much yeah straight away so previous to you i mean you've spoken about talking about it with with your doctor and using it as a trial method but was there any doubts before you started using it as to maybe the effectiveness or anything like that because i went off the tramadol obviously there was i'd been on it for 16 years i know what it's like when i've just missed one tablet let alone coming off two of them every day i just missed one you know the muscle the muscles positions that you you get are just violent and really really bad coming off the tramadol was pretty bad for me i mean it takes you in a pretty dark dark place yeah it's just it's a weird i'm pretty upbeat up going on a joke around i'll muck around quite a bit but when i was coming off the tramadol pretty dark for a good three four weeks you do get those thoughts like suicidal thoughts and things like that because it's i think your body's craving well you're craving the uh the opioids and that and like in my case i was at quite a high dose but with the medicine whether it's oil uh or the flour they're the only two i can speak of but whatever that whatever it is for the spasm it's just where the flour works in literally within one to two minutes the muscle spasm stops within one to three minutes from now we're back often and things like that i mean you know it obviously takes time it could take a good half an hour maybe 45 minutes and it still doesn't do still doesn't take the spasm away to the point that the um medicinal cannabis does that that's what i find to be a game changer in regards to muscle spasms with cannabis i just think it's a no-brainer to be quite honest i can't speak for everyone but yeah i've known a few uh people with spinal cord injuries and yeah they've said the same thing i used to stay probably on average three to four hours a night and i do use the sleep pap machine now yeah i've reached probably around six to seven hours chronic pain also like you said earlier dean it came with um dark suicidal i guess depression thoughts and i guess the lack of sleep did not help you know while you were not only just coming off a bit as i can gather that you've been having three to four hours of sleep for the entire time you've had chronic pain 16 years probably yes once i did have the surgery on my neck without to remove three to four vertebrae and put a titanium cage in that's when they put me on the tramadol the best way to explain in my case i would say that i've found it sort of masks the pain if that makes sense it it does the job but it doesn't do the job properly obviously i'm part of the medical fraternity and we try and do a really good job of vetting medications you know we want really good scientific literature about each medication we give to our patients making sure obviously first we do no harm to to the patient making sure it's safe and then making sure it's it's actually effective in what we want it to do and all medications have to go through a very stringent process of testing investigations you know clinical trials before we say yes definitively safe and definitively works better than just say a placebo that's a very very good system in place but unfortunately it's very slow as well so medications take many years sometimes decades to come online before you know discovery of the medication to actually getting onto the the pharmacy shelves and that that's can that be exceedingly frustrating you know um when when we're talking about medicinal cannabis this is a medication that's been illegal um for for many many countries through most of the world for over 100 years for whatever reason you know i don't want to talk about that today too much but there's probably a lot of political um lobbying going on in the background that stopped medicinal campus becoming a mainstream product for um for the last 100 years or so across many countries and and only in recent times are countries and governments starting to realize it that you know there is some benefit to be had here i mean humanity's actually known this for thousands and thousands of years humans have actually used medicinal cannabis for over 5000 years i think the chinese were documented to use it as a as a medical uh as a medicine rather than to get high on and over thousands of years humans have actually cultivated this plant to contain all of these therapeutic compounds and these cannabinoids and terpenes in it and so it's not actually an um by accident that we've just come across this plant we we've over many many years many millennia cultivated this into such a fantastic compound or set of compounds and um to just forget about all of that in the space of say three generations is a little bit tragic in my mind um and and not to teach it in med school and you know i mean when i went through medical nobody taught me about the endocrine cannabinoid system nobody taught me about cannabis aside from addiction cannabis addiction how to treat and that's quite quite sad actually because we've gone through generations and generations where people have missed out on on a very useful therapy and so this is a roundabout way of saying basically we don't have those large clinical rcts you know randomized controlled trials that that say yes for sure this is definitely 100 certain that this is definitely better than this other medication you know head-to-head type of thing or and because these trials that these trials can cost tens of millions if not more to to run and can be um extremely time consuming there isn't that much incentive to run these large um large scale rcts and this hasn't been much time to do it because only in recent times have has has been a handful of countries across the world that decided that to use uh to allow the use of a dose of cannabis legally considering prescription pain medication is a bit of a go-to for people obviously in dean's case and many many others who are looking for solutions why do you think there isn't more discussion around medication addiction medication long-term side effects dean obviously hasn't slept properly for 16 years up until he started using medicinal cannabis why do you think this isn't really something people want to talk about it's it's a um what's the right way of putting it there are there are some doctors who are very open-minded um and willing to look into the evidence and do their own research and you know welcome being guided into the into this basically a new frontier well it's new but it's essentially old it's new to to everybody who's it's new to our generation but you know for that like i said thousands of years ago doctors were prescribing this stuff for many many generations so it's it's new and and some doctors uh which tend to be the slightly younger doctors are more open-minded about this stuff um and we're hoping to give a willing to give it a shot and then there are certain doctors who say no there's still not enough evidence or you know they quote they quote um some some of the bitmap that that gets constantly quoted to say they don't want to prescribe it which is fair enough i mean it's a with any sort of new medicine or technology there are going to be people who are skeptical you know we we completely understand where they're coming from as well so the only way to reduce the stigma and the skepticism is to educate you know do these podcasts to uh we run webinars to patients to doctors um just to help educate them and and to get them to think about alternative sources of therapy so for their patients um don't rule something out i mean if if somebody if somebody for example someone's only just heard about medicinal cannabis let's just say it's from this podcast something else they heard about you they're like we want to hit you up what is the consultation process when it comes to people who are interested in exploring medicinal cannabis my personal preference is if patients can have a you know quick chat with their doctor and have a talk to them about whether they feel like they're okay to use medicinal cannabis i always like to get the the patient's usual specialist or gp involved in the care so to provide holistic care to the patient i i don't like to you know just see the patient just one time and just you know write a script without sort of justification i think yeah having having the doctor's approval is as good it's not absolutely essential but we would like to you know get a patient summary and maybe even a referral but yeah it's pretty straightforward they can call us up and then the doctor will go through all the you know ins and outs of what the discipline of this is how how it works what might be suitable for them or if it may be suitable for them at all there's quite a lot of bureaucratic tape that you've got to get through um from an administration perspective but we we basically sort of handle all that paperwork and help the patients out as best as we can oh it's just going to add add to what what what david was saying um uh you know with the with the paperwork and whatnot in australia medicinal cannabis is not considered a frontline treatment or a frontline therapy so there is a bit of a qualification process there you know patient would have needed to have tried standard medicine first and then we can access uh you know the medicinal candidate permits therapeutic goods administration so i mean i i know that you guys um both kevin and yourself have only had it just seems like this company is so new like 2019 you and so what do you think that the future house no that's not the right question let me start that again um where do you see the future of medicinal cannabis in australia do you see it being more widely accepted in a shorter term or do you see this still being like a bit of a mountain to climb i think it's it's growing um you know one of the biggest i guess hurdles that we're dealing with now is you know the public awareness of medicinal cannabis uh you know we'll have a number of patients call us up and they say like wow you know we were just on your website or we saw it on the news and we didn't even know this was was legal i would say like maybe the majority of the public just aren't you know aware of it and how to access it yeah from the practice perspective you know we're we're getting more and more patients every month and we've been really busy and we're really thankful for that um especially you know during during covid when other businesses have been uh impacted so yeah i think it's uh you know it's it's on an upward trajectory and mainly due to the fact that this this form of alternative medicine is helping a lot of people again you know like david said it's it doesn't work for everyone but there are some great results that we're seeing and as people become more and more aware of it and hopefully it just it just continues to grow so if people want to find you and they want to look to you what what where would you want to send them to where's your address email phone number yeah they can go to uh

4BRzu7BAWHc,Employee Rights For Medical Cannabis Patients explained by Stipe Vuleta (Chamberlains Law Firm),2021-02-21T22:49:26Z,hi i'm stephen from chamberlain's law firm and today i'm talking with honolee about employment law and medicinal cannabis a really interesting grey area i guess because the rights of employees at work and the interaction of those rights with third-party rights really fall into three categories first they're the employees private rights so privacy and the rights they have to you know monitor their own health and medicate themselves in a way that is appropriate for them in accordance with their prescriptions the second category would be the rights and regulations of employers the relationship between employee and employer and obviously the federal system of laws which encase and encapsulate that relationship as overseen by the fair work act and the fair work ombudsman and then obviously third-party rights whether they be through work health and safety laws whether they be in relation to any third-party rights and and the interaction of the individual as an employee and those third parties so it ultimately comes down to from a practical sense the interaction of workplace policies i guess being the first layer of the onion and the employee so when we're trying to determine what are my rights at work with respect to medicinal cannabis it's going to be driven predominantly by what does my workplace policy say and so that can be in the context of working in a place which is you know medicine or even intoxication tolerance so you know you can have a couple of wines and return to the workplace and complete your work or you're not operating heavy machinery so it doesn't really matter if you're under the influence of medicines which might impair your ability to drive or which might make you drowsy and i think that second category is really relevant to medicinal cannabis but then swinging over to the other side of the spectrum which is well what about zero tolerance policies what about policies which we often see which might at least appear to be inflexible the reality of it is is the law is unsettled but what we have found is it's a shaker fries test so even the fair work commission and the federal courts which oversee the decisions of the fair work commission will you know throw all the facts into the bag and shake them up with a seasoning and inside you've got shaker fries and and what they've tended to find is no such thing as a zero tolerance policy everything from the details around you know the habits of an employer the nature of the type of testing the very specific facts of the employees use of a particular substance at work all go into whether they are truly breaching a policy and whether an employee an employer's interaction under that policy is i guess just or balance i would be first considering as an employee who might be subject to scrutiny of the employer i would say well if i'm comfortable with my privacy and i'm open to talking about my consumption of medicinal cannabis with my employer then i'll check the policy and if it's a liberal policy that allows the consumption of prescribed medications then i might choose to waive my right to privacy and openly engage with hr about that process and then secondly i might consider even in the context of me working in a place that has a zero tolerance policy rather than waiting for an incident to occur and challenging it on the basis of some murky laws which have shown that there isn't anything such as a zero tolerance policy i would probably turn around and focus on engaging with my employer about the treatment that i'm undertaking my consumption of cannabis in a prescribed way and how that interacts my workplace because it could be found that ultimately the mistreatment of an employee outside of you know very narrow circumstances in which the consumption of cannabis either recreational or medicinal would impair their ability to do their work might be discriminatory it might even just quite simply be deemed unfair dismissal because it might just not be a valid reason to sack someone even if a policy says that it is so engagement with your employer is always useful simply the answer is no there's no basis for an employee to be dismissed by an employer for holding a prescription under any australian law and then taking it even further if your prescription for any medication but particularly say medicinal cannabis being the subject of our discussion tonight is related to something which might be considered more than just an illness whether it's a terminal or painful or otherwise if what you're suffering from is a substantial long-term impairment to the point where you might even be considered disabled under various types of federal and state legislation then the very act of you being treated differently for having a prescription for medicines which are there to treat your condition may be itself considered discrimination and in certain states and territories you might have access to rights which you may not have in other states and territories for being discriminated against as well as under the federal scheme quite simply their rights are firstly their own privacy as i've previously said so if they don't want to talk about it they don't want to engage with their employer and they want to risk going down the route of the sydney train scenario that we discussed and that's that particular employee's prerogative but my view would be that a proactive approach is the best approach so actually discussing with your employer you know heavy opioids are available under this particular policy or a subject to an exemption or have been engaged in by other staff under prescription well i'm actually you know a user of medicinal cannabis here's my prescription this is what i'm engaging in this is why it benefits me and this is why it won't impair me at work is a far more proactive approach to take because at the moment the law is unsettled as we've said but it would appear that a flexible policy with the right engagement would protect both the employee and the employer not talking about it would probably be a political so your rights as a medicinal cannabis patient are the same as any other employee which are you may refuse drug tests at work however if you refuse those drug tests in the context of a clear and defined policy then you may or may well likely be sanctioned and probably appropriately by your workplace so working backwards through that most negative outcome if you are proactive about your engagement with your employer and you've disclosed to them your participation and use of medicinal cannabis then there would be no reason not to be drug tested and that's the advice i guess without tying ourselves to the advice because lawyers love disclaimers that's the advice that we would give to any client in that particular scenario which is if there is a policy and you haven't done the wrong thing you should stick to that policy refusal to give a drug test for reasons unrelated to a medical illness or unrelated to something which might see you be discriminated against is not a valid reason to refuse a drug test you can refuse it you know we don't live in an authoritarian state where your employer can just you know force you to pee in a cup or jab a needle in your arm but you might you might face workplace sanction and probably rightfully it's a really interesting thing that you've raised because a lot of those particular industry sectors are also historically very conservative they're run by conservative employers often a state or territory government they're also very high risks so they tend to have zero tolerance policies because the individuals are either you know looking after small children or looking after the sick or elderly or in their their emergency room so they're going to have a lot of restrictions on them as individuals which other workplaces may not have so they would probably be tending to shy away from pushing the limits of you know what is appropriate or usual use of prescribed medicinal cannabis in those workplaces but at the same time you know what are their rights there have been a you know a number of recent cases which really deal with the capacity and obligation of an employee to refuse to divulge certain personal information which might be inherent to them but independently provable so these things involve location data from phones and various information from apps which people might have on their phones or other devices which would show their employer that they may or may not be subject to certain risks whether it's risks in around you know attending unsafe places or being subject to you know quarantine or being subject to infectious diseases and what those cases ultimately found is that it can be a breach of privacy law for an employer to compel an individual to share certain information about themselves so ultimately a individual may be protected from i guess being dismissed or losing their job because they refuse to share certain information whether that is you know personal information or because they refuse a drug test but ultimately there are other ways to skin a cat and what invariably ends up happening is if you know someone who's refusing drug testing or they're refusing to provide information to their employer they may not be directly sanctioned as a result of that but their role may change and so they may have to be put on different duties they may be unavailable or unable to do their work in the appropriate way and then we get into the murky territory of well is the employer creating a circumstance where someone who has a legitimate medical condition is being discriminated against or is it a circumstance in which someone has a condition which may or may not be the subject of discrimination laws who's put themselves in a position where they're unable to fulfill their employment obligations because of their refusal to engage in a certain activity so linking it back to that particular industry sector it may be very challenging for certain doctors or emergency room staff or nurses to continue on in employment if they're refusing drug testing when that drug testing might be you know verifying their general safety and compliance with other policies which are unrelated to the use of medicinal cannabis so again back to what i feel is the theme of my commentary tonight engage proactively be open you know when you're doing something which is legal and prescribed by a medical professional there's no reason why you shouldn't be open about it with your employer well the first step would be read all your employment policies at work uh before you start a job make sure you're okay with the policies if you're already in a workplace and you start to be in a position where you are then needing to consume medicinal cannabis then be open to the extent that you feel comfortable be open with your employer and to the extent that there are policies which might contradict with your legal and appropriate medicinal use of cannabis in and around the workplace just engage with your employer proactively about it as as i mentioned earlier and as a lot of viewers would know almost 50 of australians based on recent polling are pro the legalization of recreational cannabis and i can only imagine how far greater that number is for the condonement of the use of medicinal cannabis so you probably find that you know a positive engagement with your employer is all you need and if you can't get the outcome that you want engaging yourself then maybe working with others in our collective community to help you in that advocacy piece whether it's engaging with others in the online community or other professionals like myself to help you around that i could see that might assist as well so most workplaces will still call it something like a drug and alcohol policy workplaces which are in and around heavy machinery and higher risk activities will normally have a number of policies which deal with workplace intoxication and prescribed medications and so on a more specific way so i mean working with your employer whether it's a small business or a larger business go to whoever's responsible for hr and ask for all of your workplace policies um and look for any policy which deals with any of the buzzwords in and around a prescribed medications medications substances of intoxication controlled substances substances of abuse all of the various buzzwords which you know your hr professional sitting in the back of the workplace might have used to either properly or improperly describe cannabis and read that and really understand it and ask around ask hr what their policing processes are ask you know if you're on site you work in a more practical job ask a site form and ask someone in the yard you know what is the policy for drug testing what happens if you are you know testing positive to various substances what's the history of the employer because as we've you know discovered in chatting tonight it's not just about what the policy is but also about the nature of work that you do and the history of the employer and also their response so you could have an employer who you know has a zero tolerance policy is very ad hoc and then tests you and discovers that you're positive say for one or both of the main substances which are tested with respect to cannabis and then engages with you about it and acts reasonably however as a lawyer that's not my natural inclination i'm a pessimist i always say plan plan plan read the policy the first answer to that is obtain legal advice um i know you know lawyers are expensive there are a lot of providers which provide you know pro bono legal advice for those that are in financial distress and if you've just been made you know if you just lost your job you may qualify for that so even though community legal centers and legal aid if you're really financially struggling but engage a lawyer and look to exercise your rights because if the racing case law has shown us anything it's that um you know it's it's not a you know a dead set outcome um even if you've been dismissed as a result of the positive drug test at work there's more to unpack before you walk away i guess um and without sounding overly cliche as far as a wrap-up of an interview but um you know there's a maxim in in my industry which which says something like you are what you tolerate and ultimately in the context of medicinal cannabis in the workplace we don't want to end up being a society that tolerates a very important and effective treatment which is otherwise accepted by greater society is something which is hidden and effectively made illegal or viewed negatively we should work as a community to improve our society in our workplaces to be places that tolerate the medicinal use of cannabis rather than higher thanks for joining us for today's interview about medicinal cannabis and employee rights if you found this information useful and you'd

6EzvDbCkWzU,Cannabis Nursing,2021-05-07T00:53:57Z,marijuana pot weed reefer dope whether you like it hate it or have never tried it cannabis is here to stay 52 percent of americans have tried it at least once in their lives and an estimated 8 300 new people try it each day regardless of whether or not it's legal in their state cannabis interacts with the endocannabinoid system otherwise known as the ecs a system present in all animals except insects and protozoa it is the guiding system and master regulator charged with maintaining homeostasis in all the other body systems unfortunately due to stigma in the current federal classification of cannabis as a schedule 1 drug many patients are afraid to speak truthfully to their health care team leaving their health care in the hands of friends family members and bud tenders none of whom are trained in how cannabis affects disease states or how it could interact with other medications bud tenders may know their cannabis but they do not understand how the metabolism of an elderly patient is different from their own at 25 years old worse than this the endocannabinoid system is still not being taught in most medical schools ninety percent of physicians getting ready to graduate from allopathic and osteopathic medical schools say they are not at all prepared to recommend medical cannabis eighty-five percent receive no formal training in the ecs and thirty-five percent don't even feel comfortable answering their patients questions about cannabis let alone cbd and it's not just the doctors who are unprepared there are documented knowledge gaps across the health care system so even if a patient risks censure from their doctor by bringing up the subject they are most likely getting information that was gathered from the nightly news rather than actual scientific evidence and there is evidence the u.s national academies of science engineering and medicine stated that there is conclusive evidence that medical cannabis is effective in treating chronic pain chemo-related nausea and vomiting and patient-reported multiple sclerosis spasticity cannabis research has exploded over the past few decades and there is a growing body of evidence that cannabis is effective for other medical conditions in fact despite the federal government's decision to list cannabis as a schedule 1 drug which means it has no therapeutic potential the government has in fact registered a patent for the use of cannabinoids as antioxidants and neuroprotectants current scientific evidence has shown that cannabis has a superior safety profile when compared to many commonly used medications in recorded history there have been no reports of cannabis overdose deaths unlike the 128 opioid related deaths per day in 2018. unlike tobacco smoking smoking cannabis is not correlated with a higher risk for lung cancer or copd and a study of nurses administering vaporized cannabis to patients in the hospital setting showed that the nurses did not have thc in their blood urine or saliva after administering it to their patient the evidence of cannabis effectiveness is growing day by day some of the conditions it is being used for include migraines anxiety depression ptsd insomnia alzheimer's disease dementia parkinson's disease inflammatory bowel disease endometriosis all varieties of pain and it's even being studied in patients with asthma for its bronchodilating and anti-inflammatory effects given the existing knowledge gaps drug interactions and widespread confusion around how medical cannabis use differs from recreational use nurses are in a perfect position to prevent harm and guide patients in their wellness journey who better than nurses the profession americans overwhelmingly rate highest in honesty and ethics to guide patients and safe use of what some see as a natural miracle drug as nurses we are trained to look past the hype and use scientific evidence to guide our patients the nursing relationship can increase patient satisfaction outcomes and compliance and the national council of state boards of nursing recommends that all nurses understand the ecs and medical cannabis according to the guidelines published in 2018. as nurses it is our duty to care for our patients without judgment and to the best of our ability that includes understanding the current research on this the master system of the body the endocannabinoid system if 52 of americans have tried cannabis you can bet your patients are using it are you prepared to help them if not join our next cohort and become the canny nurse you were always meant to be
QD79FayUWvw,Medicinal Cannabis Prescribing in Primary Care,2021-12-02T19:18:46Z,good evening everybody and welcome to our medicinal cannabis prescribing in general practice webinar i'd like to begin by acknowledging the traditional owners and custodians of the lands and waterways from which we are all zooming in from today we recognize their diversity resilience and the ongoing place that first peoples hold in our communities we pay our respects to the elders both past and present and wish to extend that respect to any first nations people connecting today we commit to working together in the spirit of mutual understanding respect and reconciliation we support self-determination for nation first nations peoples and organisation and we'll work together on closing the gap my name is helene and alongside me is jade and we are the workforce development officers at with west vic phn i'd like to welcome everyone here this evening a little bit of housekeeping the majority of our webinar events are recorded and freely available on our phn lane youtube channel jade will put the link to access all our recorded webinar events into the chat we have a practice communique that we send out to practices fortnightly with valuable information including an internal and external calendar of events you can also subscribe to the westfit phn fortnightly newsletter by our website please make note of the westfield phn health pathways relating to this topic that is on the screen at the moment for this evening's meeting may i ask participants to remain on mute for the course and should you have any questions please type them in the questions box and they will be answered during the course of the meeting our speaker for the this evening is dr adam stoub who is the addiction medicine specialist at ballarat health services and he will um just introduce himself so thank you adam i will now hand over to you anyways thank you very much helene all right i'm just gonna move some stuff so that i can see my screen better so uh yes i'm a i'm not quite a specialist yet um final year addiction medicine registrar um at ballarat health services um finishing up and should be a complete specialist um in early 2022. so uh i've been asked to talk about medicinal cannabis because it is a bit of an interesting topic um and i'm sure lots of people are getting questions from their patients and colleagues of what do we do how do we do what is going on here and yeah hopefully tonight we'll clear up some of the the questions and help understand everything that's going on so tonight we're going to talk about quite a few different topics um all within excuse me the the cbd thc area as well as a bit of an update um on uh prescribing nicotine containing liquids so we'll talk about at the end so at the end of this you should understand the differences what between cbd and thc and i'll tell you what those acronyms mean identifying the adverse effects that can happen from them talking about drug interactions especially with relation to the pharmacotherapy and opioids thinking about the potential implications uh when used by patients with acute and chronic medical and psychiatric conditions and we'll talk a little bit about the clinical evidence that supports the use of medicinal cannabis and then very importantly um i'll save the really boring dry stuff for the end talking about how you actually go about prescribing it should you decide that you're going to do this in your practice um that's me so you can look at my ugly mug there or if you've got the webcam up you can look at my ugly mug talking the whole time here now just a bit of a refresher about what cannabis is and who uses it what it does how long it's been around there are millions and millions of people worldwide that use cannabis for various different reasons in various different forms primarily it comes from three different plants and that's the cannabis sativa cannabis and deca and cannabis reuteralis it's primarily used as the leaves or flowers and we think that there's about 70 to 100 active compounds but there are hundreds more related compounds the two main ones that we always talk about are the delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol that's the thc so t for tetrah for hydrogen cannabinol for c and cannabidiol so cbd the male and female plants you'll hear terms of hemp and marijuana they contain various amounts of thc and cannabidiol depending on which plant they are that you can't really tell definitively which plant you're getting when you purchase it on the street or from a uh an importer or manufacturer so it's really difficult to tell male and female but it is one of those plants that is male and female and phenotypes now why is it relevant for us um humans have cannabinoid receptors in the brain and the peripheries and they're called canon you know cb1 cb2 um both thc and cbd act at these receptors in some fashion so do we have these just for cannabis no we we actually produce our own endocannabinoids cannabinoids um and that's the anandamane sorry anandamide and the two uh arachinide arachidonyl glycerol those ones are produced natively in the human body now we can consume and prevent you know get extra cannabinoids through the use of the cannabis plant and there are many different ways to consume cannabis and i'll talk about those in a little bit so specifically two compounds that we deal with primarily is the delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol or thc it is produced in the buds and the flowers of the female cannabis plant and in the female cannabis plant only the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis is thc and some of the way it works is you get this downstream dopamine release via that mesolimbic cortical system now if anybody's seen any of my echo presentations i'll use that mesolimbic cortical system before because it's really important for dependence formation as well and so we get that activation in the nucleus accumbens and then the substantia [ __ ] and those two then remember and get that executive response get those the rewards um from uh activation you get your pleasure in the nucleus accumbens you get your bigger hit of dopamine and the substantia [ __ ] and those two in combination implant that memory in the brain of this is good we felt good when we had this this is a nice thing let's do it again right but thc doesn't just act there that's a really important section for developing dependence there's a whole lot of other places that it does act here's a small list and you can see you know various different places you know all the way from the amygdalin the basal ganglia through this brainstem cerebellum hippocampus hypothalamus neocortex nucleus accumbens and even in the spinal cord itself and each of those different areas it has a different effect and because of that this thing you know acts so many different places in our brain there's a whole bunch of different things that we can harness from it and can also cause some troubles so having slowed reactions is not necessarily a great thing you know impaired memory probably not great increased appetite okay well that one could actually be a beneficial effect um some euphoria altered pain sensitivities so there's not too bad not yeah not pure good not pure bad all right all right what about cannabidiol okay cannabidiol is non-intoxicating it acts more the cb2 receptors than cb1 it regulates the excitatory glutamate and the inhibitory gaba activity it's mostly basal ganglia and a bit of prefrontal cortex and interestingly enough because it's found in both male and female plants and in combination various different uh amounts within the the products that are available on the market it acts a bit as a modulator against thc reducing some of those adverse effects all right that's really important when we talk later about how we prescribe medicinal cannabis and what we need to think about when we're using either a pure thc a predominant thc a balanced product a predominant cannabidiol or a pure cannabidiol product so yeah as everybody has known it's really clear and easy to think about how we're going to prescribe this stuff we'll talk more about this as we go on one of the other things that it can do is modulate the resting limbic activity with those people who have anxiety and autism spectrum disorder so it can help modulate that activity to identify a little bit more about where it goes here's a nice little picture you get activity everywhere in the brain through all the way deep deep deep all the way out so everywhere everywhere how do we take it there's a whole bunch of different ways the oral route you can get it as a tincture you can bake it into cookies using it as an oil or butter uh you can actually make oils and use drops you can get nabixo malls you can get liquid caps wafers pick a different way you can get it smoking it vaping it dry powder inhalation um there is even a um like a nebulized version that you can have as well there are creams and patches there's so many different ways to use cannabis all right how does it work and what's the actual pharmacology and we'll talk about pharmacokinetics as well the absorption and the duration of effects really depends on how you take it i'll talk more about that in a little while and the ratio is important as well so as i said cbd is going to attenuate some of the bad effects so there's negative effects of thc so a pure thc products probably gonna cause a little bit of you know hallucination paranoia anxiety without some of that reduction in an attenuation effect from the cbd so we may not want to use a pure thc product now one of the interesting things in why we always heat cannabis in some fashion is the other cannabinoids that are within the plant need to be heated to then get converted into thc and cbd so they're not really active until they're converted cbd does control some of the metabolism of thc and that's via the liver cyp 450 system so it helps modulate how fast it's absorbed and it you know keeps us from having too high of levels the next bit is two is that um the effects are really dose-related with some variation so the more you give somebody the more they're going to get an effect and generally giving two different people the same dose you're relatively going to get the same effect there's a little bit of variation but not too too terribly and certainly not as big of a variation between people as something like methadone for instance the biggest thing is you get that reaction relaxation euphoria and then you can get some of that psychoactive stuff if you get a big enough dose you're going to get auditory and visual hallucinations in anybody okay now talking about the actual kinetics inhaled is your fastest onset somewhere between seconds to short minutes the peak effect in 15 to 30 minutes and it's gonna offset probably two to three hours so really quick on relatively quick off as well sublingual so if you've got it there and a wafer that's dissolving under the tongue a little bit slower you know take minutes to long minutes um similar peaks similar uh duration as well it's relatively quick or also if you're taking the drops if you're swallowing capsules you're eating some brownies um you know you've made some gummies whatever um onsets somewhere between 30 minutes and 90 minutes gonna have an effect that's going to peak about two or three hours later and last anywhere up to four to 12 hours so really long duration there and that's really important when you're talking to patients who are possibly using this method that if you don't have the effect that you're wanting right away oral absorption takes longer and it takes longer to get to your peak so don't just i've had my brownie and you know it's half an hour and i'm not really feeling it so i'm gonna have another one okay well hang on your effects gonna be you know potentially in 90 minutes and a couple hours from now so just watch out and be careful there topical is a lot slower onset it's got a smaller peak but can have a longer duration of time depending on how long the patch remains in place so if we're thinking about things like uh comparing like a fentanyl patch change it every three days okay your duration's about three days something like a duragizic so a northbound buprenor buprenorphine patch it's on there for a week really long duration as long as the patch is there okay it's not pristinely clean and non-interactive it couples via g proteins it's metabolized in the p450 system in the liver um and if if anybody's thought about these things before that 3a4 p450 section is really important in the metabolism of a lot of other drugs at its usual concentrations cannabis will inhibit the p450 3a4 section at normal doses it'll also do 2d6 at higher concentrations and some of the 2c9 at usual concentrations 2d6 is really important for things like um a lot of your opioids 3a4 methadone a lot of your other drugs for standard you know like anti-epileptics things like that all right our opioids really important um we do have a lot of our our patient population that are using opioids either prescribed or illicit if they also decide to use cannabis there's going to be some interesting interactions between those cannabis can affect that opioid metabolism we've seen in studies increased levels of methadone in patients that use cannabis and you've also noted some increased analgesic effect when cannabis is consumed in the presence of opioids in some studies other studies have shown a little bit lesser of an effect some of that has been attributed to that i feel more relaxed air go my pain is less and so it's really hard to determine is it purely that the cannabis is augmenting the the plasma concentrations of the of the opioids or is it that the effect of the cannabis itself is helping you feel more comfortable and less paint so it's hard to tell for sure going to be almost impossible to pull that out into a study and a lot of it also depends on whether the opioids active before it's metabolized or after it's metabolized in the liver all right what about other medications and other drugs now cb1 receptor if you activate that it can stimulate alcohol intake and alcohol cravings okay so we know that activation cause happens with cannabis so a lot of people that smoke cannabis ingest cannabis have complained about increased alcohol use and increased cravings for alcohol there's also some essential interactions in cocaine use disorder we don't see a lot of that in australia so i won't talk too much about that at the moment the opioid and cb1 receptors happen to be co-expressed in the nucleus accumbens and in the dorsal striatum and they've got reinforcement properties between morphine and withdrawal symptoms and so you can get some pretty nasty withdrawal in that combination of opioids and cannabis all right what about cannabis and other diseases okay we know that smoking cannabis buds and leaves itself um can produce a lot of the chemicals found in in combustible tobacco so there is that increased risk of lung disease and cancers bond use is in uh is implicated in negative pressure barotrauma and a lot of that is because the negative pressure required to pull the smoke up through the water will cause a lot of negative pressure in the chest and that negative pressure can actually pop belay cause problems as well bongs also if they're not kept clean the water's not changed etc etc there's a lot of fungal lung infections so if you've got somebody who's got a weird respiratory illness always check are they smoking marijuana if they're smoking marijuana do they use a bomb if they use a bomb how often do they clean and change the water cannabis has been implicated in increased risk of stroke and heart disease there's risk of increase in instances of testicular cancer there is a risk of temporary psychosis paranoia and anxiety a lot of that is dose dependent um it's linked to depression anxiety and suicide but some of that's not clear whether it's an association or a causation so a lot of the studies that have been uh investigating that have looked and found that in people who have cannabis use they have higher instances of depression and anxiety and people who have anxiety and depression may have higher uses of cannabis and whether it's cause or whether it's a temporary attempt to alleviate symptoms it's hard to to separate out it has been associated with lower birth rate increased risk of brain and behavioral issues and newborns specifically in that attention memory and problem solving and thinking back to a few slides ago when we talked about where it works or how it works it's not um not surprising for that there are some secondary effects on children in houses where cannabis is smoked so the second-hand cannabis smoke can have an effect on kids as well there's been a whole lot of attempts to try to link cannabis to schizophrenia and there have been a bunch of different trials that have said yes it causes schizophrenia no it doesn't at all it might make you more likely to have it if you've got a propensity towards schizophrenia no it doesn't it's really hard the evidence is completely mixed and no way to say yes or no and it may be trying to toss up is it a cause or is it is it a symptom so is somebody trying to alleviate those effects of schizophrenia by smoking cannabis all right so now that i've scared everybody saying yeah here's why you shouldn't do it at all and here's why it's all bad what do we actually get when we use cannabis all right human body gets relaxation euphoria laughter and excitement more social bill increased appetite increased creativity helps people sleep can act as an anti-nausea agent people talk about using it as a stress reliever sounds pretty good does a lot of good stuff in the short term you get some psychomotor behavior disruptions so you're all discoordinated and you don't care so much and stuff's a little bit weird okay i might have some short-term memory difficulty that feeling of being stoned getting hungry people talk about the munchies maybe some analgesic effect and certainly has been shown to act fairly well as an anti-emetic long-term use okay long-term use gets a little bit more problematic because there has been signs of cognitive ability decline and not 100 reversible as i said before maybe some stuff with schizophrenia we have done some studies with mri over longitudinal periods that there are gray matter changes there's a loss of volume in the medial temporal cortex leading to increased dependence in increased cravings the temporal pole and orbital frontal gyrus you get reduced emotional connection with sensory stimuli so something that would normally make you laugh you just go huh you're less engaged with things the para hypopara hippocampal gyrus reduces your memory capacity and your ability to learn and the left side the left insula you lose the ability to process error and what that means is that you make a mistake but you don't know that you've made a mistake and you can't recognize that you've made a mistake so leads to some significant problems other long-term things total words recalled quantity frequency duration age of onset again the more you use the longer you use the the harder it is and the bigger the damage is so what you would expect all right what happens if we have somebody who decides all right i've been using cannabis and i don't want to do it anymore you do can you can and do get a withdrawal syndrome decreased appetite labile moods poor sleep headaches anxious loss of focus sweaty chills cramps depression cravings and unlike a lot of our withdrawal symptoms that we talk about you know alcohols you know somewhere between one and five days usually heroin is you know one to seven days maybe methamphetamines five to seven days cannabis withdrawal is long your symptoms peak somewhere about 10 days after you cease and can last three weeks or more so if we've got somebody that we bring them into a withdrawal unit all right you're here for a week great fantastic you haven't had cannabis in a week go home there's still three days until their withdrawal symptoms are the most they're gonna be in the community maybe not as supported as they were in the withdrawal facility and really really craving and really feeling terrible so we need to think about what happens when they leave our care do we need to can't follow up with them in a close uh monitoring method all right i've said cannabis is a great anti-medic so why does cannabis hyperemesis syndrome exist it's this really weird counterintuitive process what is it to begin with what is it it's this repeated severe bounce of vomiting almost like cyclical vomiting it is almost exclusive in people that are long-term daily users and how it actually happens because cannabis in the brain dampens down emesis but there's not just the brain as the emesis centers in the body there's a few places here but in the gut there's some more emetic in in emesis causing areas and what happens is that in the body and in the gut it actually stimulates vomiting and so you get this really bad cramps you get this really bad vomiting that in the brain it's trying to turn it down but it ain't happening so how do we fix it okay well you stop using cannabis and you just wait and it's pretty terrible for however long it lasts for somebody some people and it can last days to you know a couple weeks maybe depending on the person usually reduced by hot baths or showers and some of that is thought to be related to the hypothalamus and its effects on nausea and so you get that that heat that changes with the hypothalamus which controls your temperature centers and you activate that and hopefully it helps activate a bit of the nausea stuff which is why people have those baths and they're always in the shower it's always really hot until the water runs cold if it's bad enough um you need to have the person in hospital give them iv fluids anti-medics analgesia anxiolytics while they're going through this horrible feeling of nausea and vomiting okay so we've talked a few things about cannabis how it works what it does there's a couple of interesting nasty things that go on with it but a lot of people still want to use it for various different conditions all right so talking about that we need to look at what have we proven about cannabis because we work in an evidence-based field we want to know that what we're doing is in the best interests of our patient and it's actually going to have an effect we want to know that it's good and not going to cause them harm and unfortunately in the medicinal cannabis world it is a minefield you go out and do a google search or a google scholar search or pick pubmed and look for cannabis there are thousands of articles and some of them say yes some of them say no some of them say maybe there isn't any great long-term big trials and a lot of that is confounded because there's a high prevalence of cannabis use around the world and trying to find some you know specific groups of people to use it's going to be really hard most of these trials are small they're not randomized they're not controlled and when they try to take them into larger groups it's really hard to make generalized statements because you'll bring a group of people in with pain okay so we've got chronic pain patients okay we've got a thousand patients and we've got hip pain back pain neck pain headaches gut pain you know trauma pains neuropathic pain surgical pain fracture pain so many different things that we're trying to say one thing is going to fix all of it and you can't pick any of the any of the information out of it and the subgroup analyses end up with such small subgroups that you can't generalize anything with it and it makes it really really difficult to see does this medication actually work that causes lots of problems okay that being said what do we actually know what we know is that it's not great for chronic non-cancer pain there's a little bit of evidence in neuropathic pain maybe weak to moderate level cancer pain again weak to moderate there's maybe some benefits in the symptoms related to cancer like all that perineoplastic stuff i apologize for my clock [Music] all right now there is good evidence for dravet syndrome which is a severe form of epilepsy of infancy five percent of the population that uses cannabidiol androvet syndrome become seizure-free not a lot but getting an infant seizure-free probably worth trying there is some evidence for spasticity in spasticity and in ms you get some reduction in the spasticity but it doesn't show much else other than for a pure [ __ ] and ms picture we know that we can use it as an adjuvant to other antiemetics for chemotherapy related nausea we do know that there is some improvement in hiv-related wasting and a lot of that comes from that increased appetite we know that there's a little bit of evidence for ms tourette's and mnd pain symptoms and there was a recent trial in australia that has basically said you shouldn't prescribe it for chronic back pain it doesn't doesn't actually help there's been a few decent trials babylonis and walsh in 2020 found that there was reduced pain in animal studies however when they then converted it into humans there was a preference for thc but it didn't actually reduce the opioid use and they found that um opioids by themselves were better for analgesia and opioids in the presence of thc actually increased the risk of opioid misuse so probably not a good idea raymond and company in 2017 had an observational study they felt that cannabis was more effective than opioids and was preferred but they didn't actually sort of say what did that mean what do you what do you mean by you prefer it over the opioids or you don't want opioids or yeah there was really they didn't actually clarify that may the there's some thoughts that maybe there's a benefit from that anxiolysis and improved sleep but not necessarily from pain relief there's some questions about whether we can use it to help de-prescribe opioids but what they found was it didn't actually show any improvement and there was potentially a slower rate of increase in opioid overdose deaths so maybe it doesn't actually help indeed deep prescribing but maybe slows down people overdosing and dying maybe there's no real good links between medicinal cannabis and opioid reduction they there are a few studies that show that education around opioids actually increased reduction rather than the addition of cannabis so as we all know if we talk to our patients about why we want to reduce them and how we're going to help them what we're going to work through and counsel our patients they actually reduce their use so let's keep doing all the important things rather than throwing yet another medication at somebody okay cancer pain really big really important section there's a few review articles that say that there's stuff all right there's a lot of small studies there's a lot of different treatment regimens and a lot of varied patient groups because it's kind of hard to find big groups of you know specific cancer modalities some studies have found that if you have a higher dose of thc it helps with reduction of the pain symptoms but you do get increased side effects and it wasn't statistically powered properly or powered well enough to say definitively any of the studies that had a low risk of bias showed no improvement in cancer-related pain that's the pain side of things some with the symptoms and the the other side effects of of cancer but not with the pain itself nausea and vomiting we've used cannabis for nausea and vomiting for a long time there's a few studies that have looked at that with chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting it was great we used it all the time fantastic and then a new trial happened um recently and published in 2020 they used a combination product um there was a one-to-one uh ratio so balanced product not real big 72 participants they found that if you add the cbd and thc product there was reduced nausea and vomiting but you also did get increased side effects um and they did note that the patients were able to tell uh whether they were on the active product or the placebo because they had a preferred preference to the one that actually had it so it might actually help a little bit there now with a lot of this nausea and vomiting we know that a lot of our newer antiemetics for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting far outstrip what we used to have and so cannabis for cinv is not as useful now as it used to be okay probably by far our largest patient group is the chronic non-cancer pain group there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of medicinal cannabis for chronic non-cancer pain and i hate to tell that to all of the people that ask about it the iasp recently presented their position statement and it can you know confirms that there's not a lot there there was a review that looked at 36 different studies with over 7000 participants there was huge risks of bias there was very low evidence for short term cannabis and longer term nabixamalls but again minimal risk improvement there was another one where moore and company looked at 106 different articles and what they actually reviewed was a review of review articles which was kind of cool to look at um but none of them looked at the effects of a particular cannabinoid for a particular dose for a particular route of administration for a particular condition reporting a particular outcome so what i was saying before there's so many studies where they're trying to combine lots of different things and we don't know exactly what we're looking at and you couldn't actually provide any good basis for decision making this is the iasp's statement from march of this year and i'll read it out because it's really important although there are pre-clinical data supporting the hypothesis of cannabinoid analgesia current uncertainties especially in the clinical evidence dictate that the evidence base regarding efficacy and safety fails to reach the threshold at which iasp can endorse their general use for pain control the studies and the statement are limited to the use of cannabinoids to treat pain and not for other conditions for which cannabinoids are currently being used all right so it's really important so this is purely based off of pain control they're wanting to stay away from anything else that within pain control there's not enough evidence to say that it's safe to use or will be beneficial and they also said that while the iasp cannot endorse the general use of cannabinoids for treatment of pain at this time we do not wish to dismiss the lived experiences of people with pain who have found benefit from their use so what they're saying there is that we don't have enough evidence to say that it works but we know that there are people who have anecdotally had benefit and so we can't say no you can't use it at all ever because we know that some people do get a benefit okay if some people get benefit great we're not going to say you can't use it perhaps we need to think about using it for some people all right now into the really important but probably a bit drier part and i apologize for this it's really important in victoria accessing and thinking about medicinal cannabis medicinal cannabis was approved by the tga in 2016. and from then there has been a massive increase in number of approval and applications and at the moment it's approximately 3 000 per month medicinal cannabis is not pbs listed it is available in victoria via permit system as either schedule 8 or sass b depending on the formulation cbd only products are scheduled for if they are listed in the artg and none of them are listed at the moment so whilst in theory a cbd only product could be purchased from your pharmacist there's no products that are allowed to be imported and sold by the pharmacists so that's kind of a difficult situation there interestingly enough they have kept medicinal cannabis prescribing very broad any doctor anybody don't care what kind you are don't care whether you've had any training in it don't care whether you've done anything else don't care whether you physically see patients you probably should if you're going to be prescribing stuff to them but you don't have to see very many there are also special permits for authorized prescribers and we'll talk a little bit more about that in just a second trouble with it is it is not pbs listed and the cost can be profoundly prohibitive it can vary immensely depending on the product where you're getting it from what it contains what the dosage is and it can be and i've i've had done this because i didn't believe the number anywhere between 50 and a thousand dollars per week which is ridiculous there are some clinical trials that may provide access the trouble with that is if it's a randomized controlled trial double blind you may or may not actually get the active product and you probably won't get it afterwards unless you're willing to pay 50 to a thousand dollars a week so probably not going to be a great idea for most of our patients very very importantly especially when you're having a conversation with your patients it is in victoria still illegal to drive with thc in your system and it can be present for several days post your use depending on how long you've been using it for so our balanced products our products that contain some thc our c thc predominant and our thc only products anybody put those on you know put those on um they can't drive legally so that's a little bit prohibitive as well and interestingly there's only two registered products in victoria those are nabixomals and epidiolex and we'll talk about those two products what is nabiximols it's sativex there's a nice little picture there it's an oral oral mucosal spray it's licensed for use in the treatment of symptoms related to spasticity in ms that's the only reason you can get it it reduces muscle tone relieves some of the symptoms of bladder spasm you can get up to 12 sprays a day it contains a relatively even balanced mixed thc in cbd the evidence is not great it's probably effective for spasticity pain and urinary dysfunction and it's expensive six to eight weeks is going to cost you about 745 dollars so yeah that's a little bit tricky there epidiolex very newly approved and pbs listed it was tga approved in september 2020 it is a cbd only product and on the first of may of 2021 this is the first medicinal cannabis product that has been pbs listed this one you can get with a health care card for six dollars a month if you need to indicated for the adjective treatment of seizures associated with a couple of very specific epilepsy disorders lennox gestalt syndrome and dravet syndrome for patients that are two years of age or older getting it is severely restricted the list of of what steps you have to go through to get the authority is about as long as that it is insane the doses are usually 10 milligrams per kilo per day titrated up to 20 milligrams per kilo per day in divided doses but it is a product that is now listed okay now for the really boring and dry stuff if we're actually going to prescribe medicinal cannabis how do we actually go about it it's kind of confusing and it took me a little while to try to wrap my head around it as well fortunately there's a digital form so that makes it a little bit easier and in victoria completing the digital form you get both your sasb and s8 permits completed at the same time so you don't have to do two different forms excellent makes it easier there are four different options the first one is to become an authorized prescriber for an established history of use now what that means is you can become a person who's allowed to prescribe for a specific product without the need of an ethics committee approval or endorsement from a college the product has to be on a list of medications that has an established history of use which is basically cannabidiol only dominant or balanced so heavily in that cannabidiol section treatment for anxiety or refractory chronic pain okay so not too bad you could become that once you're the authorized prescriber then it's a whole lot easier you don't have to fill out all the forms as many times and you are a person who's allowed to prescribe it great okay authorized prescriber standard pathways our second way it does require approval from a research an ethics committee or from a special college before you apply to the tga because they're gonna want here's the letter it's used for just about everything else and you would then be allowed to do stuff that has thc only or thc dominant products in that category and you've got to have really good justification for why you need to become this authorized prescriber to not get a permit every time you do it for all of this stuff okay a little bit more of a difficulty there if you're going to want to do it without having to send off the applications every time you can use a an sas category a which is for those critically unwell people that are expected to die within months if treatment is not commenced it's done by a patient-by-patient basis and the approval comes directly from the office of drug control right so there's if you really need a hurry you really really have to get it you think it's going to be the only thing that's going to save this person okay let's try really importantly and what's probably going to be the one that most people use is the sasbs individual patient permits for an unapproved medicinal product unapproved by the tga you need to outline the symptoms and the diagnosis for which you think this patient needs to have medicinal cannabis you need to be able to detail what treatments they have tried and failed or have excluded because of patient factors and you need to document an appraisal of what you think is actually going to help and what the risks are of the treatment there's no specific medicinal medical conditions that will be approved the way that the website lists it is you can give it for anything you think will actually benefit but you have to be able to justify the use and then you have to have a decent knowledge of the condition being treated to justify it and the dprg may ask for specialist support for okay why is this person prescribing this for for that have you spoken to a psychiatrist have you spoken to addictions but have you spoken to a pain specialist all right you might have to have a little letter saying yes i think this will work for this person once you get the permit then you have to have a plan for the pr as to the prescription and the dosing you've also got to discuss and organize that plan with the pharmacy to make sure that the product is going to be able to be dispensed and you have to have at least monthly monitoring to review the effect and the side effects and most of the permits will only be valid for about 12 months before you have to renew them before you prescribe it you've got to take a good history being able to document all of the things that you're taking in into consideration um you know mental health history family history physical history examinations yeah other things that have been tried what interactions that the patients got with other medications all of the things that might contribute to failure of treatment or impact on our level of success and it's very important to come up with that initial plan okay one to three months usually but what it'll take to establish whether it's working or not at the beginning it's really important to document what you think is going to happen and what our goals are what do we think is going to class as it's working all right i want joe blogs to become pain-free in three months and if he's not it's not working okay that might be aiming a little too high but we've got a clear goal pain-free three months okay well something to shoot for i want tom to not vomit every day after every meal okay that's a clearer goal you know we want to reduce his vomiting let's see what it looks like in three months at three months has he stopped vomiting every day if the answer is yes he stopped bombing every day and it's now every second day we might actually class that as a success because yeah he's not vomiting all the time so he tom's probably feeling better so let's think about what all is going on all right maybe that's actually efficacious maybe tom wants to continue taking this medication all right think about your risk mitigation if they've got concerns about misuse how are you going to monitor it what are we going to do if we don't think it's working you know if this person's taking this medication for three months and it's really not improving their symptoms okay maybe we need to back off maybe we need to wean it down over a couple of months and stop thinking about and document how you've had that discussion with the patient and their understanding and make sure make sure this is really important i should have made this one in red make sure that you document that the patient understands the rules about driving when using a cannabis product so that they know that if they've got a product that has thc and they get pulled over and drug tested they're going to get fined make sure you have documented clearly that you have told them that so that if they drive and they get caught they're like my doctor control me and then you go back uh yes i did three months ago i told you that sorry um you've got something to stand back on all right okay there's only a couple of contraindications all right absolute first one is obvious if a person is hypersensitive and allergic to cannabis don't use cannabis duh if they have unstable or severe cardiac disease don't add cannabis to the mix if they have had previous psychosis or they have an active mood disorder or anxiety disorder it's a pretty pretty bad thing to start something that might lead to these issues now remember though that the anxiety disorder is a reason with an established history of use for cbd so that one's not an absolute absolute um i think you might look at if it's like flooredly active they're so anxious that they can't do anything maybe not add cannabis to the mix for the moment maybe figure out another way to to bring the anxiety down and then try to use it as a a way of reducing how active their their anxiety is um and it is contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding we know that the cannabinoids do cross into breast milk across the blood uh placenta barrier so probably shouldn't do that while you're pregnant or breastfeeding relative contraindications under 25 years of age and a lot of that has to do with the fact that up to about 25 the brain is still developing there have been quite a few studies that have shown that cannabis use in a developing brain doesn't like the developing brain doesn't get to its maximum potential so try to avoid it if you can in somebody under 25 if you've got severe liver or kidney disease you know try not to if they have a concomitant substance use disorder probably not a great idea to add another possible substance of dependence if they're using other cns depressants and in the significantly elderly population all right so important important slide here how do we dose it just like everything start low and go slow give the patient time to uh increase it titrate the dose as to where everything goes there is a huge variation in the effect across the products and the patients and the conditions and so there is no one right answer you can consider a dose as low as one milligram of thc per day if you're going to use a product that has any thc in it at all uh a lowish dose of two to three milligrams per day can be an effective um but in a couple of medications they showed that um about a 20 milligrams of thc per day with a max of 40 is probably your effective therapeutic range um sativex uh the divixables is one to twelve sprays per day that is 2.7 milligrams of thc and 2.5 of cannabidiol in year one spray all the way up to a total of 32 and 30 for the day so that's about similar to one of the other products great so it's a good range to think about the general advice that i would give to anybody is pick your product of whatever you're gonna do pick the product start with the lowest dose you can use and then tie trade up okay don't titrate up in one day titrate up over weeks okay take your time with it don't be in a rush ignore that one and that one all right now for the last little section i want to talk about our nicotine vaping products because on the first of october the only way you can get nicotine e-liquids legally is to have a prescription all right it's a schedule for medication so you can get it at the pharmacy you have to have a prescription to receive nicotine containing e-liquids whether that is from your local pharmacy or whether you are importing it from overseas you have to have a prescription it is illegal for vape shops to sell nicotine liquids at all at all at all at all at all it is also an unapproved medication just like medicinal cannabis and is also not pbs listed great the recommendations is that it should not be the first line treatment as there are other well-proven therapies the long-term effects the safety and the efficacy are still not proven at this stage really important slide here the racgp the racp the australian heart foundation and the australian lung foundation have all released statements advising against the use of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation and in the icgp smoking cessation paper recommendation number 15 says look you shouldn't use it as first line but if you've tried a bunch of other stuff okay if you've used behavioral support you've used tga proof pharmacotherapies and it's not worked but the patient that you have is still motivated to quit smoking it may be a reasonable intervention to try along with behavioral support but you need to make sure that the patient you're prescribing for understands the evidence understands the lack of evidence proof of benefit and that they're aware that the long-term health effects are unknown it is also not registered as a therapeutic good so the safety is not established within the the vaping design devices and the nicotine liquid products there's not a lot of uniformity so we're not quite sure which one's going to contain what and be better or not and we you should avoid dual use of e-liquids and tobacco so you should minimize that and the goal for the person should be to cease using e-cigarettes as well it's not for years and years and years for the rest of my days i'm smoking vapes now it should be that this is an aid to sensation and that you need to have regular patient review okay this is from the rac gp and it is a pain in the butt to prescribe sort of authorized prescriber don't need your permits you're an authorized prescriber done you can become an authorized prescriber and i'll tell you how later or if you want to you don't want to become a prescriber i want an individual case by case i want to make sure that we talk about it we make sure we've got everything there scsb application for every single one okay you can also establish personal importation access for the patient in front of you and so that's going to give them the ability to have three months supply from international support now the trouble with that one is there's less regulation and there's concerns about quality assurance and any shipment coming from international to a patient has to have a copy of the prescription in the box or it's going to get taken all right all right how can you become an authorized prescriber pretty easy if you go to the compliance.health.gov.eu sas register or whatever there you can click on the box to become a new nicotine authorized prescriber fill out all the application stuff regarding the dose form and indication that you think you're going to be using and it's basically nicotine in solution assault or base and for smoking cessation you understand the privacy agreements submit your application then you can become an online prescriber or did um an authorized prescriber so it's pretty easy so what's your prescriber what do you do about it all right there's a nice little form and uh i've got the links for the for this section down at the on the last slide so don't write any of this down um there's links to this pdf um and this is from i think from wollongong what do we use how do we use why do we want to use and what are we thinking about things this slide is really good for people that are new to nicotine vape products so you think about where are we looking at um you know are you low to moderate okay what kind of device are we going to use i've been talking for an hour now uh where is our starting dosage what flavor are we going to use are we actually going to use any flavor are we just going to use nicotine liquid that doesn't have any flavor where are they getting it from how are we going to get it and what are we going to do in terms of reassessing and um the the supply and all of that okay now for those people that are existing vape product users now before the legislation came into about okay so what how much are they using of what kind of concentration what devices are they using what are we doing this okay here's our dosage goes through what flavor options do we want to use okay where are we getting our supply what are we doing for reassessing all right same sort of things only it's a little bit easier because your patient comes in and says this is what i'm already doing doc can i just have a script for what i'm doing well we talk about it and see where they're at with everything reassess why they're doing it what are our goals all those things but let's keep going down that same pathway we're not going to say no we're going to see what we can do to help them out and some idea here on this same this is all in that same pdf talking about okay what are we looking at what's the equivalent to this okay where are we looking at what's uh what kind of solutions do we need to think about and what are the the tanks and the pods and the disposables all look like and there's that list of resources including the tga stuff as well as the wollongong information that top link there where they talk about the analysis of evidence from university of wollongong it actually goes through each of the different types you know pods versus you know contain versus disposable how it works what kind of delivery you get what kind of you know amount of vapor you get when somebody's breathing out so it's really good and a very handy thing to talk about and read before you talk to your patients about so if somebody comes in and goes yeah i'm using one of these you're like okay what the heck is that how do you feel that where do you get oh okay but if you've already read this and you looked at it you go ah this is one of those self-contained things it has a pot okay what's your concentration there okay you can ask all the right questions you can understand the patient in front of you a little bit better and help engage them and that is all she wrote and so i expect there's probably a few questions hi everyone it's helene again um i don't actually have any questions that have come in yet so brilliant i've done it again i've explained everything perfectly box we do have half an hour if if needed for questions so adam the first question oh well it's got will this be recorded as i'd like to share with our consulting doctors and pharmacists at work safe and the answer is yes i think isn't it adam uh yeah i believe the answer is yes um and if if people need my slides i'm more than happy to share them obviously i'll get rid of those two slides that got stuck in there somehow um okay type your questions in everyone if you uh if you've got any and we can anything at all you want to ask adam just type it in there and i can ask it on your behalf you won't be identified but they'll all be anonymously asked um marking it yet that was fantastic adam thank you so much so interesting yeah well it's an interesting topic and it's certainly one of those things that you know a lot of people have heard about it but don't necessarily know what exactly should i be thinking about what should i be talking about with my patients you know mary's come in and said hey i've been having all of this nausea and somebody gave me a joint the other day and my nausea went away what do you think about medicinal cannabis and a lot of people get you know um struck out and go whoa hang on what's going on ah what do i do about that how do i answer that question there you go okay well let's talk about it let's think about okay what are we getting out of it you know what tell me about the nausea because maybe mary hasn't told you about her nausea you know and then you that opens that discussion and it may lead down to a prescription for medicinal cannabis but it may also be okay well we've now found out that the reason that you've got nausea is because you've got an esophageal structure and you've got that dilated now you don't have nausea so it opens that opportunity for for a discussion of conversation so only two products are approved in victoria can patients access other products like is the case with nvps which they import or can only access the two for indications other than the listed indications right um very good question um the two listed products are the only ones that are indicated and have they've been approved there are about 2 000 unapproved medicinal cannabis products out there and yes you can actually access any of those so only those two are are clearly documented as to why you can all of the other ones that anybody wants to use are available and you can pers you can prescribe them for your patient but you have to understand the patient has to understand that they're not approved medications hopefully that makes sense because like all of all of the nvps are unapproved but you can still prescribe thanks she said next question can you please provide the link for the journal articles particularly about not uh wreck cpd cbd for pain slash back pain uh a lot of them are in the bottom of my slides if it's not there let me know and i can find them yeah all right then another question if it isn't proven for long-term pain relief why is that why is the public impression that it works for chronic pain i don't know um anecdotal evidence you know my i knew a cousin who knew a friend who had somebody in high school that had chronic pain and it helped their pain um the it's one of those things that we we haven't been able to prove that it works but there's millions and millions of people that use it and a lot of those people have chronic pain and they have felt that it helped so it's just like one of those things like we think that this might work but we can't prove it um imagine a situation uh yeah it's like it's trying to get a group of people that have chronic pain that's big enough to say yes or no that all have identical kind of pain is almost impossible because even if you went you know people who have chronic hip pain post a joint okay what kind of joint did they have done yeah was it a unipolar a bipolar a tripolar was it just a dhs was it you know a moors you know what kind of a joint did they have okay how old are they how long was their pain what other comorbidities do they you have what else is the pain is it pain within the the bone is it pain because the muscles are weak is it pain because of something else and so there's so many different factors trying to put together that you you have a hard time actually determining that we have a homogeneous group that we're studying and good luck trying to get enough of them in one area or in at least one general similar you know genetic area to to be able to come up with any good evidence okay next question is it only not recommended for back pain or all chronic pain all chronic pain it just we don't we don't have enough evidence to say that it works and the one thing that i really want to i want to emphasize this because it's really important we don't have evidence that it works because all of the studies have been poor but we recognize that some people may get benefit all right hopefully that makes sense because what i'm saying and i what i want to get across is that whilst we don't we can't say that it will work we can't say that it won't work either all right we can say to our patients who ask about it the evidence doesn't show that it's going to help you here but if they want to and they want to try it and they understand that it's expensive and it might not work then it's not necessarily unreasonable as long as we think that the other patient factors are going to be safe enough it's not unreasonable to trial it very good thank you adam i don't have any other questions at the moment oh yes here we go what are the difference between pea as a medication um in brackets works on cannabinoid receptors for treating chronic pain versus cbd i don't know much about pea but if it's working on the cannabinoid receptors i would suggest probably not a lot of difference um if it's working at the same receptor then it might be doing the same thing it also depends on how it acts at that receptor so depending i would have to look that one up i'm sorry okay another question is it reasonable and worthwhile to try cbd for depression that hasn't responded to multiple medications that's one of the things that we look at um in our um in the in the sasb uh is we've tried other things we've tried conventional treatments we've tried the proven things and it hasn't worked um we know that cbd itself is uh non-dependence forming which is uh quite handy and so it's not unreasonable to try it we've tried other things and it may be beneficial but again with all of those other things that i said make sure that you've had you've taken that good history you make sure that you know what else is going on with the patient and that you set clear goals at the beginning and clear monitoring of how are we going to determine whether this is helping your depression or not okay thank you adam if there's no more questions we will finish the session and i'll just take this opportunity to thank you so much adam we're so fortunate to have such an expert in this topic addressing us and we really do appreciate your time with that so thank you very much and everybody don't forget your evaluations they'll be posted out after this emailed out after this event so if you could take the time um to fill those in and i will end the session now thank you everyone bye
