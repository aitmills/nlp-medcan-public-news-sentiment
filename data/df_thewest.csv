Brazil offers a significant growth market for MGC Pharma, with about 10,000 patients suffering various medical conditions who are currently registered with the Brazilian authority, ANVISA, to receive cannabinoid products directly. MGC Pharma struck an initial seven-year supply deal with ONIX earlier this year. The deal involves an agreed minimum order volume of 20,000 units in the first year with an estimated value of at least €1 million. The minimum order volume from year two onwards is 50,000 units per annum with an estimated value of at least €2.5 million a year. According to Perth-based MGC Pharma, it has become the first company globally to ship high-THC formulations directly to a patient’s door in Brazil, without the need to visit a pharmacy, once they have a prescription written by an ONIX referring doctor. ONIX, which currently has more than 100 referring doctors in Brazil who can prescribe cannabinoid products under the country’s compassionate use program, is looking to have more than 300 referring doctors by the end of this year and more than 1,000 by mid-2021. This is an incredible achievement as no other company has shipped high-THC formulations directly to patients in Brazil before. We have been working closely with our Brazilian partner ONIX and remain confident that Brazil will be a huge strategically and commercially important region for us going forward. Feedback to date from patients in Brazil has been extremely positive and we are seeing rapidly increasing demand for our Mercury Pharma products.

Founder and chief executive Matt Shales said that increasing research and clinical trials since the legalisation of medicinal cannabis in October 2016 was still throwing up opportunities. “When we look at the amazing results we’re getting from these cannabis products so far, it’s really just with the most standard formulas,” Mr Shales said. “Now that we can actually start to look into this with proper research ... we can improve the formulas, improve the efficacies to bring costs down for patients and have more targeted products for certain conditions.” Mr Shales founded MediCann in April 2019 after using medicinal cannabis for his own pain and sleep management for a decade. The company develops and supplies medicinal cannabis products around Australia through its MediCann Clinics. It is also collaborating with Curtin University and the Perron Institute to explore the use of medicinal cannabis in treating concussion to minimise the damage incurred by AFL players and others who have suffered head injuries. “With 200,000 concussions occurring in Australia each year with no treatment options, we feel it’s a very important area of research,” Mr Shales said. “The ultimate goal for that research is to have a medicine registered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods to allow for government subsidies making the medicine affordable for Australians.” Pointing to FreshLeaf Analytics data which forecasts Australian medicinal cannabis sales of $423 million this year, up from an estimated $230m in 2021, Mr Shales said it was an exciting area to be in. “The stigma is slowly changing and acceptance is continuing to grow every day,” he said. MediCann Health is now looking to raise $3m through a crowdfunding campaign opening this month through Birchal, with the funds going towards the expansion of their medicine range, team and sales force. The firm’s portfolio includes medicinal cannabis brand Maali, hemp brands Hemp Brothers and EndoScent.

The Perth-based company says it has achieved consecutive record week-on-week sales and revenue growth through September and October, exceeding $225,000 in the past 4 weeks. The numbers represent its best consecutive weekly sales results to date. Whilst the company has already sold over 7,000 units across its key global markets since its Mercury Pharma product line was launched last year, it said it was on track to deliver on its stated sales objective of 5,000 units per month in the first half of 2021. Close to 1,900 patients worldwide have now been prescribed Mercury Pharma products and a growing order pipeline for products in Australia and its new market in Brazil is set to deliver record December quarter sales and quarterly revenue results according to management. The strong sales were achieved despite the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the operation of its European manufacturing facilities. MGC Pharma said its operations are structured and authorised to continue throughout the second European wave of COVID-19, despite a 30-day ‘epidemic’ being declared in Slovenia. It is increasingly brought to our attention that one of the major inhibiting factors for patient access to medicinal cannabis in Australia, and globally, is the high price point that comes with high-quality medications that are not covered by insurance. We are constantly streamlining our operations in order to lower our overall cost base, to ensure we can meet our obligation to increase patient access to affordable, high-quality medicinal cannabis products. We are seeing the results of this strategy through the increase in patient demand and sales volumes.’  The Mercury Pharma product line is a range of prescription-based phytocannabinoid medicines which are commonly used to treat anxiety, schizophrenia, nausea, vomiting, inflammation, and epilepsy. MGC Pharma’s recent research has highlighted the positive impact of using other, specific phytocannabinoid formulations developed by the company in the treatment of glioblastoma, the most aggressive and, so far, therapeutically resistant primary brain tumour.

https://thewest.com.au/business/public-companies/mgc-to-enter-latin-american-with-medicinal-cannabis-deal-c-570346,MGC to enter Latin American with medicinal cannabis deal,"Saturday, 8 April 2023","ASX-listed bio-pharma company, MGC Pharmaceuticals, has taken a major step towards capturing the growing Latin American medicinal cannabis market by joining forces with Brazil’s leading merchant bank in a ground breaking sales and distribution deal. Under a 50/50 joint venture, MGC and BrasilInvest will sell and distribute MGC’s phytocannabinoid-derived medicines, not only in Brazil, but also in neighbouring Latin American countries where the use of medical marijuana has been approved. Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay have all approved medicinal cannabis use, potentially opening up a number of lucrative sub-markets for the new joint venture partners. BrasilInvest was behind the formation of Brazil’s first merchant bank in 1976 and has since established a multi-billion dollar track record in investment strategies within South America. It will use its extensive network to promote MGC’s wares to medical professionals and potential distribution partners across key markets in the region. In particular it will register MGC’s pharmaceutical products in Brazil under the JV company’s name and establish working relationships with doctors. For its part, MCG will manage the operations of the new company, provide IP formulas and standard operating procedures for the registration of its products, supply marketing resources and submit all clinical data. Distribution in Brazil will be via MGC’s existing agreement with ONIX Empreendimentos e Participacoes, a local outfit which also promotes business activities in the region. With its population of 210 million, Brazil represents the largest economy in Latin America. It is also at the forefront when it comes to embracing the use of medical marijuana, with the first license for a cannabis-based medicine, Sativex, being issued in the country during January 2017. Earlier this year Brazil’s health regulatory agency, Anvisa, which supports the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes, submitted two proposals for public consultation looking at both the technical requirements for plant cultivation by pharmaceutical companies solely for medicinal and scientific purposes and the procedures involved for the registration and monitoring of cannabis-based medicinal products, their derivatives and synthetic analogues. There is also a bill currently on the floor of the Brazilian House of Representatives to allow the full commercialisation of cannabis sativa-based medicines. In another positive development, the MGC/BrasilInvest JV has received initial import permits and purchase order approvals from Anvisa. As a result, it is now expected that MGC’s first product will be shipped to Brazil during December. MGC Managing Director and co-founder Roby Zomer said: “This binding agreement with BrasilInvest represents a key milestone towards establishing MGC as a leading international producer of phytocannabinoid-based medicines.” “We look forward to implementing our ‘Seed to Medicine’ strategy in this new marketplace and hope to replicate the success we have experienced in both the Australian and European markets thus far.” With some industry observers predicting that the medical cannabis market in Latin America will be worth a whopping $8.5 billion by 2028, MGC may well eke out a solid early mover position in this most lucrative of markets.

Chronic pain sufferer Francesca James, 27, says the clinic is a fresh start for her. “It been a nightmare. This is a godsend ... my life sucked before cannabis,” she said. A consultation at a new clinic in Subiaco can prescribe the medicinal cannabis she used to import illegally. But the process not as simple as many think. You have to be referred to the clinic by a GP. After a 45-minute consultation the doctor decides if medicinal cannabis is suitable for a patient. But before they can prescribe medicinal cannabis permission needs be given by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and WA Health Department. That can take up to a month. If permission is granted the clinic can write a prescription which patients take to a pharmacy which then has to order it, usually in oil form. Not only is it hard to obtain medicinal cannabis it is also expensive. It is not on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme so patients must pay the full price. Depending on the dosage — the average is about $300 to $350 a month. But for long-time sufferers like Ms James it is worth the expense. “This is her chance to get her life back,” Dr Berenice Blakemore, of Cannabis Access Clinics, said.

The company said CogniCann was developed with the specific aim to treat symptoms associated with dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. The trial will involve a total of 50 patients with dementia or Alzheimer’s disease over the age of 65 at various aged care facilities across Perth. The specific aim is to evaluate the potential behavioural benefits of CogniCann on those patients as the company said the number of patients with various behavioural difficulties is growing globally. MGC Pharma said that this Phase two clinical trial was looking to confirm the clinical effectiveness of the CogniCann drug and determine the therapeutic individual dose response. Results of the trial are expected in the third quarter of 2021. The company said that the CogniCann medicine is the only dementia targeting phytocannabinoid-derived product available for prescription in Australia and it is accessible through its distributors, Cannvalate and Health House International by prescription under Australia’s Special Access Scheme. MGC Pharma’s research partner in the clinical trial, the University of Notre Dame, will be led by Dr Amanda Timler. Management said the research team at Notre Dame was recently rated at world-standards for its health and medical research during Australia’s 2018 Excellence in Research Assessments. Co-founder and Managing Director of MGC Pharma, Roby Zomer said: “I am proud to see the commencement of this Phase II clinical trial in partnership with UNDA. The Trial will provide the healthcare community with more evidence on the performance and the benefits of phytocannabinoid-derived medicines, in particular for patients suffering from dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, and we hope to see positive results in the near future.” “If successful, CogniCann® has the potential to positively impact the lives of patients and their carers around the world, and contribute to a novel avenue of clinical research and development for contending with the challenges of the effects of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.” MGC is a reasonable way ahead of the majority of the medicinal cannabis hopefuls listed on the ASX.

Notably, the company more than doubled the number of units prescribed in October, when compared to September. Management said the recent landmark milestone appears to underline its strengthening position and the rapidly growing popularity of medicinal cannabis-based health products. MGC has managed to grow the demand for its proprietary medicines on a global scale within a relatively short period, demonstrating the immediate, ongoing and material revenue-generating potential of the company’s products. These include CannEpil and MXP100, which are prescribed in Australia under the Special Access Scheme and in the UK through specialised doctors permitted to prescribe phytocannabinoid-derived medicines under the Early Access to Medicines Scheme. CannEpil is the company’s high cannabidiol, or “CBD”, and low tetrahydrocannabinol, or “THC”, phytocannabinoid-derived formulation, used in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. The MXP100 product is recommended for use in mild neurological disorders, inflammatory and hepatoma patients, with the latter being a cancer of the cells of the liver. Both products are proprietary medicinal drugs developed internally through MGC’s research and development divisions. The company is rapidly advancing its international distribution efforts in a bid to lock down major markets ahead of any competing products. One of MGC’s key distribution partners, Cannvalate, who account for more than 50% of prescriptions to date, due to its close ties with the medical community and national footprint, has reported increased interest in the company’s products. MGC also said that Cannabis Access Clinics had recently joined fellow Australian, Tetra Health, as one of the company’s important clinical partners who will expand the network of medical professionals informed of its available product range. The company’s European-based, “seed to pharmacy” strategy closes the loop for its medicinal cannabis products, with the MGC now on track to significantly increase its production capacity after recently signing a long-term lease agreement with Maltese Government-owned Malta Industrial Parks, for a 6,000 square metre site to cultivate cannabis plants. The company has begun site works for the fully-integrated, multi-storey building in Malta that will contain 15,000 square metres of space for the cultivation and manufacture of cannabinoid-derived medicines for its proposed global distribution networks. This facility, when constructed, will be capable of producing over 8,000 units of each MGC Pharma product per hour and has been designed with significant excess capacity to meet the company’s future needs, once in full swing. MGC’s “EU-GMP” manufacturing facility in Slovenia can produce pharmaceutical-grade phytocannabinoid medicines for about 5,000 patients a month at full capacity. The ASX-listed company recently received new purchase orders exceeding €0.3m, or AUD$485,000, across its product range, as demand continues to skyrocket globally. MGC Pharma Co-founder and Managing Director, Roby Zomer said: “From a standing start, we have now hit 1,000 prescriptions in a short space of time and ahead of schedule, demonstrating a clear demand for MGC Pharma’s products. The established profile of return patients for (the) products is expected to drive the prescription growth rate through November, December and beyond.” Cannvalate CEO Sud Agarwal said: “We are delighted to see that MGC Pharma's product range has been so well received by the medical community. Each week, there are hundreds of patients that are accessing MGC range medication via our network. The spike of interest has been due to superior quality (EU-GMP), competitive pricing and individually designed condition-specific medications.” NB: This article is for general financial markets news purposes only and is not to be taken as an endorsement of, or advertisement for any individual product, medicine or drug.

Perth phytopharmaceutical company Little Green Pharma harvested its first crop in WA’s South West last week, almost 18 months after it revealed it was cultivating plants. It is the first time medical cannabis has been grown in WA, with Little Green Pharma the only company in the State with a licence and permit from the Office of Drug Control to grow crops locally. Managing director Fleta Solomon said the company had reached a major milestone towards its goal of producing high-quality, locally grown medicinal cannabis. Its long-term aim was to build a world-class production facility in WA and expand business. “We will now dry the flower and shortly after extract a sample of resin to send to an approved certified laboratory,” Ms Solomon said. “Testing the resin for purity and quality assurance is mandatory.” Strict controls around the production of medical cannabis meant the company could not reveal the location of its secure hydroponic growing facility. Ms Solomon said the plants being cultivated generally had lower levels of the psychoactive THC cannabinoid and higher levels of the non-psychoactive CBD cannabinoid compared with recreational marijuana. Directors of the company recently returned from a fact-finding mission on the medical cannabis industry, taking them to Israel, Canada and the US. Ms Solomon said they had looked at large-scale growing and manufacturing facilities and planned to raise funds to enable the company to ramp up production. The company also wanted to take part in medical research and was in talks with several research institutions in WA and overseas. Patients will need a doctor’s prescription to get medical cannabis.

Notably, the increase comes after the company recently broke into the European pharma-market after getting green-lighted from the Irish Government to sell its phytocannabinoid-derived “CannEpil” product to epilepsy sufferers. In Brazil, key legalisation was recently passed relating to cannabis for medicinal use and MGC expects prescription numbers to begin to grow in this emerging market too. The ASX-listed company is at the forefront of growth in the burgeoning medicinal cannabis market with its proprietary CannEpil and MXP100 medicines rapidly gaining acceptance globally. CannEpil is the company’s high cannabidiol and low tetrahydrocannabinol, phytocannabinoid-derived formulation, used in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. The MXP100 product is recommended for use in mild neurological disorders, inflammatory and hepatoma patients, with the latter being a cancer of the cells of the liver. Both products are proprietary medicinal drugs developed internally through MGC’s research and development divisions MGC was recently awarded a $25,000 payment from the Innovation Connection Grant from the Australian Government to support its research. In particular, the money is being used to support a clinical trial for its CogniCann product that is being run alongside the University of Notre Dame in Western Australia. The trial is set to assess human patients’ symptoms that are associated with dementia and Alzheimer’s disease in a controlled, double-blind placebo trial. Worldwide, every three seconds, someone is diagnosed with Dementia, according to Alzheimer’s Disease International – and according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, dementia is the second leading cause of death in Australians. Even the West Australian Government has been getting in on the action with Health Minister, Roger Cook, recently revealing that WA GP’s will be able to prescribe medicinal cannabis to a wide range of patients. If MGC’s CogniCann® trial is successful in reducing or eliminating the devastating symptoms associated with Alzheimer’s and Dementia, the company will eek itself out a spot in the medical community usually reserved for big pharmas. On the international front, the company is rapidly advancing its distribution efforts in a bid to lock down major markets with Managing Director and Co-founder, Roby Zomer saying: “First prescriptions in Ireland signify another milestone for MGC as we expand our product offering to new territories and thereby gain access to more potential customers.” “We continue on an upward trajectory, as we’ve increased our prescription numbers by more than 25% is just a few weeks. I’m confident that in 2020 we’ll be able to deliver our phytocannabinoid derived medicines in even more jurisdictions as we continue to gain momentum.” MGC has a “seed to pharmacy” strategy that closes the loop for its medicinal cannabis products right through the value chain from genetic development to packaged pharmaceutical, sale-ready products.

The ASX-listed, Perth-based medicinal marijuana company hopes to be one of the first suppliers out of the blocks come June 2021 when the TGA approval kicks in. And MGC Pharma feels it is in the box seat to capitalise on the TGA’s decision to “down-schedule” some low-dose cannabidiol-based medicines from Schedule 4 to Schedule 3 status. We are very pleased to see the proposed down-scheduling changes from the TGA. We are one of the market leaders in Australia for CBD products and these changes provide MGC Pharma with the ability to further increase our product offering and market penetration, while at the same time improving accessibility and affordability of high-quality CBD products for patients. The company recently imported its first shipment of the European Union-Good Manufacturing Practice certified Mercury Pharma product line, which significantly expands the current range of CBD medicines available in Australia. MGC Pharma says the soon-to-be-finalised acquisition of the Medicinal Cannabis Clinics business, which it is buying for $1.4 million in cash and scrip from Melbourne-based medicinal cannabis distributor Cannvalate, also bolsters the distribution capabilities of MGC Pharma’s CBD-based products in the Australian market. Eligible CBD medicines under Schedule 3 are still required to be registered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, or ARTG, which requires medicinal cannabis companies to comply with strict Good Manufacturing Practices. To that end, MGC Pharma has already launched a clinical program to develop new CBD medicines in its Mercury Pharma product line that meet the proposed Schedule 3 regulations, with the aim of being one of the first companies to see Schedule 3 CBD products on pharmacy shelves next year.

In an operations update recently, MGC said that it had tested final yields of its cannabidiol or “CBD” test crop at its laboratory in Ljubljana, Slovenia, to evaluate and establish the best soil, nutrients and growing conditions. MGC said cultivation of the 5,000m2 trial crop would be used to test the running of its CBD extraction facility, which was due for completion early next year. Production of CBD for the company’s cosmetics and medicinal raw materials is on schedule to start in the second quarter of 2017, company management said. The Perth-based company’s products are based on CBD, a non-psychoactive component of cannabis that in pre-clinical trials has been shown to have a range of therapeutically useful effects, including anti-seizure, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-psychotic, and anti-anxiety properties. MGC is different to most players in the growing global medicinal cannabis industry because it has a traditional medical research program that is partly funded by a separate cannabis based cosmetics business that recently receiving its first major European sales order. In positive news for its cosmetic arm, MGC Derma, the company said it was on track to gain official approval to sell its unique cannabidiol-based skincare range into the European Union, with formal European Cosmetics Products Notification Portal registration expected in coming weeks. On the medicinal side, the company, which has Israeli executives and is backed by Perth corporate financial players, also confirmed the execution of a new and better binding heads of agreement to acquire Czech-based medical cannabis company Panax Pharma. The deal, announced earlier this month, will see MGC acquire up to 100 per cent of Panax – a highly connected player in the Czech Republic’s medicinal cannabis industry that will give MGC access to world-leading facilities in Europe for its medical cannabis research. MGC co-founder and managing director Nativ Segev said: “We are pleased to have executed a new agreement with Panax on favourable terms.

The ASX-listed company said on Tuesday that it had signed an amended supply deal with ONIX subsidiary, OnixCann, a distributor of medical cannabis products in Brazil. The deal will see the Perth-headquartered company’s medicinal cannabis-based products distributed in the South American nation for the next seven years. In year one of the multi-year deal, a minimum order volume of 20,000 units with an estimated value of at least $1.65 million will be supplied to Onix, which would increase in years two though seven to at least 50,000 units, worth $4.1 million per year, MGC Pharma said, noting that the deal may be renewed for an extra five-year term by mutual agreement. The ASX junior said the amended deal, along with its current level of monthly sales in Australia, is expected to deliver the company break-even cashflow at the start of year two of the agreement. Positive EBITDA is forecast for the start of 2021, the company added. In further positive news for the local medical cannabis player, the Onix deal includes significantly improved payment terms for MGC Pharma. According to the company, this includes a down payment on purchase order and 30-day payment terms from product arrival -- better than the standard 90-day terms. The landmark supply and distribution agreement will see ONIX purchase a bulk order of a combination of MGC Pharma’s pharmaceutical grade products, the company said, including CannEpil, CogniCann and products from the recently launched Mercury Pharma line such as MP100. Given the high standards of regulatory compliance imposed by Brazilian authority Anvisa on medical cannabis, MGC Pharma sees the decision to allow ONIX to register MGC Pharma’s products in Brazil as a significant validation of the quality of the ASX-listed company’s products. Co-founder and Managing Director of MGC Pharma, Roby Zomer, said: “This binding extension of our existing agreement with ONIX is a clear commitment of minimum order volumes over the next seven years, and confirmation that ONIX are the partners we are looking for in the region. This is a significant milestone for MGC Pharma and will have an immediate positive impact on the Company’s cashflows.” “Importantly, the Amended Agreement, in combination with our current Australian sales is expected to deliver our stated operating breakeven cashflow target of 5,000 units per month by the start of 2021.” Founder of Onix Marcelo Galvão said: “We are very pleased to sign this agreement with MGC Pharma. With a population of over 210 million, Brazil has a large pharmaceutical market.” “The ability of MGC Pharma to meet Anvisa’s strict requirements is a significant validation of MGC Pharma’s products and capabilities as a leading bio-pharma company, firmly placing MGC Pharma ahead of many of its peers in entering the Brazilian market.” The milestone deal with Onix is another boost for MGC Pharma after it earlier this year inked a new supply agreement with THC Global Group Limited, who will white label MGC’s pharmaceutical-grade phytocannabinoid, or “CBD” products to the Australian and New Zealand markets. It also recently signed a distribution agreement to produce and supply its cannabinoid medicines to South American-based Anden Bio Naturals SA, a company that was at the forefront of importing cannabis-based products into Peru Is your ASX listed company doing something interesting ?

https://thewest.com.au/opinion/opinion-doctors-views-gone-to-pot-on-medicinal-cannabis-ng-b88729080z,Opinion: Doctors’ views gone to pot on medicinal cannabis,"Saturday, 8 April 2023","Things have moved a long way in Australia in the past few years in developing medicinal cannabis to treat a wide range of illnesses. The Turnbull Government said this month it would continue to relax the laws by licensing legal Australian cannabis producers to export to countries where its use is much more widely accepted by the medical community. Here in WA, local company Little Green Pharma will harvest its first South West crop in March and expects to have an oil-based medication ready for Australian patients by the middle of April. Its progress has been amazing since Federal restrictions on the use of cannabis in medicine began to be loosened in 2016. About 320 patients have been given legal access to it since then. But one thing that has been very slow to change is the negative attitude of the doctors’ trade union, the Australian Medical Association. In August 2014, I wrote a column on these pages based on radio interviews with people who had firsthand knowledge of the medical benefits of cannabis. I cited a mother who broke the law to get supplies for her two-year-old epileptic son. “He went from being a little boy who used to stumble around everywhere and had to wear a helmet to within days being able to walk very solidly and not bump into things,” Kim told me. “Within a week he was running. It was crazy. We were standing back thinking this is unbelievable. He went from just saying one or two words at a time to putting sentences together.” That article sparked a very pointed op-ed piece by then president of the AMA in WA, Michael Gannon, who has since moved on to head the body nationally. “Why are we relying on the scant knowledge and occasionally complete ignorance of politicians and media commentators when it comes to policies surrounding health care?” Gannon wrote. Ouch. It was a bit of that 1950s Father Knows Best paternalism that is an AMA specialty. “We are standing on shaky ground if we allow our decision about this issue to be driven by commentators using little more than emotion, or politicians using examples of one or two of their constituents who claim to have found pain relief from the use of cannabis,” Gannon continued. It was such an unreasonable attack that the memory of it has lingered much longer than the flaky arguments he made deserve. This was another case of the medical establishment reacting badly when their orthodoxy is questioned. It also hinted at the influence of what is known as Big Pharma, the massive multinational pharmaceutical industry which controls the opiates medication business.  Traditional approaches are under attack by increasing interest in complementary medicine and the ease of access to information has made people far more questioning of doctors.  These changes obviously threaten the AMA’s privileged position as the self-imposed arbiters of medical opinion in the national health debate.  For a start, nowhere in my column did I push for the legalisation of medicinal cannabis. I merely gave a voice to some brave women who were prepared to take personal risks to try to alleviate the suffering of their children.  And I certainly didn’t presume any expertise in the matter. I was doing what journalism does best — airing issues to inform the public. Gannon back then was pushing the AMA mantra of caution in the approach to medical cannabis and blurring the lines of logical argument by stressing the health dangers of recreational marijuana use, which — while real — pale compared with the abuse of opioids. That dog-in-the-manger approach has continued over the years as governments slowly began to relax the restrictions on medical cannabis. This was Gannon’s response in February last year to the green light for Australian medical cannabis cultivation: “Look, I suppose it’s good news, but I’m not going to greet this with the level of enthusiasm that many others will. It’s so important that we stick to the scientific evidence about exactly where cannabis may and may not be useful.” You could hardly accuse him of being encouraging. Last June, Gannon was criticising the Senate decision to make it easier for terminally ill patients to buy medicinal cannabis from overseas, again raising the canard it could end up in the wrong hands. “Certainly, in the palliative care setting, we’re not worried about addiction and, to be honest, we’re not too worried about major potential side effects,” Gannon said. “But we remain concerned about potential diversion into the general community.” Why would people buy expensive medical-quality cannabis medications when it is much cheaper and stronger in their preferred form on the streets — or easy to grow in the backyard? But there was one slight shift in the AMA approach. “If cannabis was the panacea that the people who seem desperate to import it — if it really was that good, then it would be in liberal use across the entire medical system,” Gannon said. “We’re excited about its potential in palliative care, we’re excited about its potential when it comes to juvenile epilepsy, and forms of spasticity, but let’s look for the evidence.” One of the reasons doctors are reluctant to prescribe is the AMA’s continual negativity and the bureaucratic difficulties in accessing it. But Gannon, who in 2014 thought coverage of the efficacy of medicinal cannabis on juvenile epilepsy was “little more than emotion”, is now excited about its prospects. And just two weeks ago he appeared to shift again. “There is a small-to-medium quality body of evidence in so many of the areas where people are promoting the use of medicinal cannabis,” he said. “But there is no question that where a doctor has made a decision and the patient wants to use the medication there should be fewer barriers to obtaining a safer legal supply.” I suppose we should be grateful for such small blessings.

By night, she takes on a second job in a pub to pay for the medical cannabis that has turned her life around. The 29-year-old, who has had epilepsy since she was 12, pays almost $600 for a month’s supply of Tilray medical cannabis — a cost she is struggling to afford. Ms Merendino said the medicine had transformed her from a skeletal “zombie” on strong medication to control eight or nine seizures a day. Her weight had plummeted to 42kg, with many people assuming she had an eating disorder. Figures show that by last month, the Therapeutic Goods Administration had approved 2339 special access scheme applications for unapproved medical cannabis products, including 568 approvals last month alone. There are 52 doctors across the country who have authority to prescribe medical cannabis but no products are subsidised under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Ms Merendino said that her seizures came on with no warning other than her arm flicking up. “Before I knew it I’d be on the floor and then two hours later I’d wake up and my mum would have me on the bed and I’d be so tired,” she said. “I had medication to control the fits but the side effects were so bad that I had no energy and would have to have a sleep as soon as I got home from work.” While she still took medication to control “blank-outs” — where someone loses awareness for a short time — medical cannabis replaced the drugs that had controlled her fits. “I’m so much healthier now, you can see it in my face and body,” Ms Merendino said. “But I’m paying $450 for a 25-day supply of medical cannabis. “The only way I’ve been able to afford it is because I live at home and sometimes work at night as well — and even then I struggle.” Tilray, one of the biggest global producers of medical cannabis, is lobbying governments to contribute to the cost in the same way they do for other drugs. Vice-president of global patient research and access Philippe Lucas said the company believed there should be reasonable patient access to medical cannabis. “Unfortunately, research has shown that cost is a very real obstacle to access in many jurisdictions, so we work with government regulators and insurers to increase cost-coverage for patients wherever we can,” he said. “We believe that Tilray medical cannabis has met the standard of safety and efficacy to be recognised as a medicine and therefore should not be taxed any differently than other prescription drugs.” Sign up for our emails Find out More © West Australian Newspapers Limited 2023","Dec 7, 2018 ...

The approval is expected to result in significant import cost savings for the company and also allow MGC Pharma to expand the range of available products from its Mercury Pharma brand. The granting of the import licence is a milestone achievement for the company, who credits the development with helping advance its strategy towards becoming a vertically integrated bio-pharma company with global distribution capability. According to MGC Pharma, the licence significantly reduces its logistics and handling fees by allowing its Australian operations to directly import schedule 4-prescription only medication and schedule 8-controlled drug products into the country from its Slovenian manufacturing operations. It will now bulk import its medicinal cannabis products for storage, distribution, and sale across Australia through its commercial distribution partners. At a later date MGC intends to expand its importation activities to a wider range of products including those in its Mercury Pharma brand. The company’s medicinal cannabis products are available both in Australia and internationally in New Zealand, the UK, Ireland, and Brazil. A recent company presentation also pointed to new markets potentially opening up in the EU and Israel. The granting of the import licence in Australia is very significant for our Australian operations. With the logistics savings, we are able to become more cost-effective and are also able to expand our product offering to our Australian customers. The company also said it will now look to increase its sales team and access to clinics as it seeks to ramp up its operations on the back of the granting of the import license. In other news, MGC is currently conducting human clinical trials in Israel and India that involve the testing of its natural supplement, “ArtemiC” on patients infected with COVID-19 as a possible treatment for the virus. The company has also been chosen to be part of a global Coronavirus task force set up by the World Health Organisation that will look at various cures and vaccines being developed around the world News of the AODC’s granting of an import licence to MGC Pharma provided a shot in the arm for the company’s share price, which spiked more than 15 per cent on opening trades.

MMJ had planned to spin-off its two subsidiaries United Greeneries Holdings and Satipharm in TSE-listed Top Strike Resources. But today it announced it had received an offer from Harvest One Capital Corp, providing total consideration of $C42 million, compared to $US40 million under the Top Strike deal. MMJ would also retain a 70 per cent stake in the new entity compared with 69 per cent under the Top Strike deal. MMJ said Harvest One principals were experienced in the Canadian cannabis sector and provided access to extensive institutional and retail investor networks. MMJ managing director Andreas Gedeon said the Harvest One offer provided the company with the potential to deliver increased value to MMJ’s shareholders in the near-term. “The Harvest One proposal offers a number of compelling advantages, including a materially higher valuation for the United Greeneries and Satipharm assets, which is a significant endorsement of MMJ’s assets and development strategy,” he said. MMJ said it had executive a binding term sheet with Harvest One and would provide further updates on the transaction in the near-term. The board hopes the new entity will be trading on the TSE by the end of the year subject to due diligence and shareholder approval. MMJ's management will be responsible for the operations of the new entity. The deal aims to provide shareholders with exposure to the rapidly growing recreational and medicinal cannabis markets in Canada, which are expected to be worth $C8 billion by 2024. There are already 34 approved medicinal marijuana companies operating in Canada, 10 of which are publicly listed. MMJ said Canada had one of the most highly regulated and favourable operating jurisdictions for medicinal marijuana in the world. The company is also expecting considerable upside from a new regulatory system for recreational cannabis expected to be introduced in the second half of next calendar year. MMJ’s United Greeneries already has cannabis growing facilities in Canada and its Swiss subsidiary Satipharm has a number of key international distribution partnerships for the distribution of cannabinoid-based pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and wellness products.

In an update to the market on Thursday, MGC said the changes revealed this week by the Turnbull administration would mean patients that are prescribed medicinal cannabis would now be able to import the medication from local outfits, such as MGC, instead of having to source medicinal cannabis from overseas on a case-by-case basis. Under the changes, approved importers will be able to buy medical cannabis medication from overseas for immediate distribution in Australia, until domestic production meets local needs. The policy shift is aimed at making it easier for sufferers of a wide range of ailments to access medicinal cannabis and ease delays currently experienced at present. For Perth-based MGC, the announcement represents a major opportunity given the current ramp up of the company’s European medical marijuana production capabilities based in Slovenia.  The company is also undertaking a clinical trial of its proprietary cannabis formulation for the treating epilepsy in children and this week’s legislation change may provide a fast pathway to market if that trial is successful. Earlier this week the company said that its cannabinoid extraction facility located in Slovenia was on schedule for completion in the second quarter of this year, while its first marijuana crop from the recently scaled-up growing operation was due to be harvested in August. MGC co-founder and managing director Nativ Segev welcomed the new laws and said: ""This is a great step forward by the federal government to ensure that safe, proven medical cannabis products manufactured by companies like MGC Pharmaceuticals are made available to patients in Australia. “ “This measure will reduce the time it takes to import the product into the country, creating a shorter timeline to patient accessibility.” MGC is currently developing its research program into medicinal cannabis alongside its cannabis-based cosmetic and dermatological lines aimed at the growing global market for the previously illicit substance. They have already achieved European and US revenue flows from their cosmetic offering and the company is now moving towards the commercialisation of its dermatological line.

The company will be allotted 2200 square metres of industrial land to construct and operate a fully automatic, controlled environment, hydroponic cultivation, manufacturing and distribution facility. Other companies that were issued the letter of intent by Maltese investment body, Malta Enterprise, include Canada’s Aurora Cannabis, a CAD$7.5bn market cap medical cannabis producer. Malta, a member of the European Union, provides a gateway to the more than 500 million people who live in the 23 member countries that have legalised medical cannabis. Affinity’s planned facility will use its proven “RotoGro” technology used in Canada that allows for up to nine times the surface area for growing compared to traditional growing techniques while allowing for 5.5 harvests per year. This is achieved through the use of stackable, rotating growing beds that are expected to produce 3000 kilograms of cannabis “bud” per annum, once all units are installed. The facility will be built to meet European Union good manufacturing practice standards with an initial 15 growing units. This will be expanded over three years to a total of 175 units. Affinity said the initial build out will be funded through internal resources and the expansions via cash generation. The company will invest an initial €200,000 in a wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in Malta. A further €3.4m is expected to be invested over 3 years to achieve the planned production level. Separately, Affinity is working with Austrade and Colombia’s ProColombia to submit a licence application for the cultivation, manufacture and sale of medical cannabis in Colombia. This licence is expected to be issued during the first half of 2019. The company’s application for an Australian medical cannabis licence is also currently being processed by the Australian government. Affinity Managing Director Malcolm James said: “The approval of our plans to establish a vertically integrated cannabis operation in Malta is an exciting development which will position Affinity as a globally significant player in the medicinal cannabis sector.” The company said the Maltese approval complements its global medicinal cannabis strategy which includes strategic alliances with key industry bodies and R&D partners. In October, Affinity signed an MoU to be the exclusive supplier of algae and cannabis oil formulations in either discrete or blended forms to fellow Australian company Skin Elements. The two companies will collaborate on the development of a new range of algae and cannabidiol based natural skin care products for supply to key global markets. Affinity also recently executed an MoU with The University of Sydney in August to support its medicinal cannabis research and development activities in Australia. Under this agreement, The University of Sydney will undertake research programs utilising Affinity’s bank of Australian medicinal cannabis cultivars to develop products focused on strategic stress and pain reduction (and management) in commercial livestock and the pet animal sector. With the global cannabis market expected to be worth over USD$55bn by 2024 according to Global Market Insights Research, Affinity’s plans to establish a medical cannabis cultivation and manufacturing facility in Malta provides a doorway into what is looking more and more like a major potential market.

The exclusive five-year agreement will give MGC access to Anden’s Peruvian and Bolivian industry networks containing over 7,500 pharmacies, private clinics and an oncological private insurance system that has over one million listed clients. Co-founder and Managing Director of MGC Pharma, Roby Zomer said: “This closely follows our entry to the Latin American market in November 2019, when MGC Pharma’s products became available in Brazil and in December receiving formal approval for the sale of CannEpil in Ireland.” “We’ve rapidly diversified our global reach, with plans in place to add further jurisdictions this year, which is to have immediate positive impact on our cashflows…” CannEpil is the company’s high cannabidiol, or “CBD”, and low tetrahydrocannabinol, or “THC”, phytocannabinoid derived formulation, used in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy amongst other things. Co-Founder and CEO of Anden, Curt Schwarz said: “We firmly believe that cannabis medications have the potential of improving the quality of life of millions of people worldwide. The decree estimates that a minimum of 7,596 patients in Peru are in urgent need of access to medical cannabis…” MGC’s pharmaceutical-grade phytocannabinoid products are emerging as a realistic alternative to conventional drugs. The company’s CBD formulations are not psychoactive and are used internationally by patients for a range of indications and symptoms including pain and inflammation. According to the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, the most common uses of CBD are in the treatment of anxiety, schizophrenia, nausea, vomiting and epilepsy. In 2018, MGC received a manufacturing license for its cutting-edge manufacturing facility in Slovenia to commence producing cannabis-based medicinal products. CBD is legal in Australia under the Special Access [prescriptive] Scheme and MGC has permission from Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration to import its medicinal cannabis-based products for supply in either a clinical trial or under the Special Access Scheme. The Special Access Scheme allows health practitioners to access therapeutic goods for their patients that are not on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods under exceptional clinical circumstances. MGC has a “seed to pharmacy” strategy that seeks to be involved all the way along the value chain from seeding a plant to selling medicine.

https://thewest.com.au/business/public-companies/mgc-triples-medical-cannabis-patients-in-a-month-c-508184,MGC triples medical cannabis patients in a month,"Saturday, 8 April 2023","MGC Pharmaceuticals has received a shot in the arm for its medicinal cannabis-based pharmaceutical products business globally, recently racking up its 600th patient that has either prescribed for, or is being processed to receive prescriptions of its medical cannabis-based products in both Australia and the UK. Notably, the company has now tripled its number of patients over the last month and the recent milestone appears to underline its strengthening position and the rapidly growing popularity of medicinal cannabis-based health products. MGC has managed to grow the demand for its proprietary medicines on a global scale within a relatively short time period demonstrating the immediate, ongoing and material revenue-generating potential of the company’s products. These include CannEpil and MXP100, which are prescribed in Australia under the Special Access Scheme and in the UK through specialised doctors permitted to prescribe phytocannabinoid-derived medicines under the Early Access to Medicines Scheme. CannEpil is the company’s high cannabidiol, or “CBD”, and low tetrahydrocannabinol, or “THC”, phytocannabinoid-derived formulation, used in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. The MXP100 product is recommended for use in mild neurological disorders, inflammatory and hepatoma patients, with the latter being a cancer of the cells of the liver. Both products are proprietary medicinal drugs developed internally through MGC’s research and development divisions. The company is rapidly advancing its international distribution efforts in a bid to lock down major markets ahead of any competing products. Management recently said that Cannabis Access Clinics had recently joined fellow Australian, Tetra Health, as one of the company’s important clinical partners which will expand the network of medical professionals informed of its available product range. MGC’s European-based, “seed to pharmacy” strategy closes the loop for its medicinal cannabis products, with the company on track to significantly increase its production capacity after recently signing a long-term lease agreement with Maltese Government-owned Malta Industrial Parks, for a 6,000 square metre site to cultivate cannabis plants. The company has begun site works for the fully-integrated, multi-storey building in Malta that will contain 15,000 square metres of space for the cultivation and manufacture of cannabinoid-derived medicines for its proposed global distribution networks. Managing Director of MGC Pharma Roby Zomer said: “The increased momentum of new prescriptions in Australia and the UK is a testament to the effectiveness of our phytocannabinoid medicines and growing recognition from, and use by, the medical community.” “With our unique EU-GMP production and key market distribution infrastructure now established, we can meet this increasing demand for our offering of phytocannabinoid derived medicines in our existing and future markets in both Europe and Australasia.” NB: This article is for general financial markets news purposes only and is not to be taken as an endorsement of, or advertisement for any individual product, medicine or drug.

Madison Williamson, 15, has been taking medical cannabis as part of her treatment for epilepsy for the past 10 months and hasn’t had a seizure since, her mum says.  “Over the years the seizures changed. She ended up having cluster seizure where they could be up to 50 a day,” Amanda told reporters in Melbourne on Sunday.  “Within two months, I realised that there were no boxes ticked for seizures. There’s been nothing since to this day. Everything has changed.”  Madison has become the poster girl for the state government’s decision to expand its scheme for children with intractable epilepsy to use medical cannabis from 60 to 90.  “We are going to expand the program to 90 children so that more children have the same opportunities to fully participate in society, to see a reduction in their seizures,” Health Minister Jenny Mikakos announced, adding it would cost $3.7 million annually.  Ten children will be immediately added to the scheme, with the extra 20 young people to start on the scheme next year.  Canadian pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol is used in the scheme.  Royal Children’s Hospital paediatric neurologist Jeremy Freeman said many patients, aged from infants to 18, benefited from using the product with their other medication.  “For the patients that have a good response, the change is pretty dramatic and fairly quick,” he said.  “About half the patients we’ve treated have had significant reduction in their seizures and two-thirds of those are major reduction (less than half the normal amount of seizures), about a third of those have had about a minor reduction.”  The hospital has about 30 children on its waitlist for the scheme, which has also been rolled out at Monash Health and the Austin Hospital.  Ms Mikakos wants the federal government to add the medication it to the PBS.  The federal government last month announced $3 million for clinical trials looking at how cannabis can be used to help treat cancer pain and other side effects.  Opposition leader Michael O’Brien said more work needed to be done to find out if it is as effective as it can be before it goes on the PBS.  “(But) if it is going to be effective in helping young people get through very difficult medical problems, I wouldn’t have a problem with it being added to the PBS,” he said.

https://thewest.com.au/news/australia/wa-government-to-support-medicinal-cannabis-ng-ya-121869,WA Government to support medicinal cannabis,"Saturday, 8 April 2023","The Barnett Government has thrown its support behind medicinal cannabis in a major departure from its long-held suspicion about the emerging treatment. Commonwealth legislation making medicinal cannabis a controlled prescription drug comes into effect on Tuesday, forcing States to decide whether they will give legal effect to the changes. State Cabinet decided on Monday to fall into line and enact necessary regulations. WA Health will set up an “expert advisory council”, to which doctors will have to apply, as well as the Federal Therapeutic Goods Administration, before prescribing new cannabis drugs from early next year. It will also spawn a new industry, with growers and manufacturers able to apply for State and Federal permits from today. There is demand for cannabis as oil, tablets or spray to treat ailments including epilepsy, spasms caused by multiple sclerosis and the pain of cancer and AIDS. But its path to market in WA has been politically fraught. When Labor promised in 2014 to legalise medicinal cannabis, it was heavily criticised by former health minister Kim Hames who said consumption in tablet form would “totally dilute the message about stopping people smoking marijuana for recreational use”. His successor John Day will today welcome the new products and emphasise that illicit cannabis use is still prohibited. Royal Australian College of GPs president Bastian Seidel said he doubted doctors would flock to cannabis because supporting evidence was “very limited”. But GPs were already under pressure to prescribe it from patients influenced by “hype”. Reclassification had the potential to worsen this by being perceived as official endorsement, he said. Australian Medical Association WA president Andrew Miller said cannabis was seldom an effective drug but had strong community support because many people liked to smoke it to get high. It would have been politically difficult for the State not to join the national framework. “I suspect they are clearing the decks ahead of an election,” he said. Former Federal Liberal MP Mal Washer, chairman of medicinal cannabis company AusCann, said it hoped to be the first WA producer and had secured agreement to grow plants at Murdoch University. The company says hundreds of clinical studies and firsthand evidence support the drug’s benefits. Sign up for our emails Find out More © West Australian Newspapers Limited 2023","Oct 27, 2016 ...

By 10.44am, shares in Cann Group were up 28 per cent at $3.68, The Hydroponics Company had gained 22 per cent to 87.5¢, and WA-based AusCann had soared passed a dollar for the first time, up 31 per cent to $1.075. Distributor Bod Australia also hit record highs in early trading - and was still up 24 per cent to 53.5¢s - after inking a manufacturing and commercialisation agreement with pharmaceutical company iX Biopharma Limited to develop a cannabis wafer product. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt today said granting the export of medicinal cannabis products was “an important step” for the development of the sector and to secure long-term supplies for Australian patients.  “This decision will help both the domestic supply and Australian producers by strengthening the opportunities for domestic manufacturers,” Mr Hunt said in a statement.  He said allowing the export of medicinal cannabis product will also help the developing domestic market to grow further, amid increasing competition from imports. AusCann managing director Elaine Darby described the decision as a win for Australian companies and patients.  “This will really strengthen the industry, enabling it to supply Australian patients - in addition to international patients - with high quality, cost- effective cannabinoid medicines,” Ms Darby said.  “It will allow the Australian medical cannabis industry to scale up to a certain size and stability, making it easier to produce more cost effective products in a shorter amount of time.”  Cann chief executive Peter Crock said the decision would allow the company to set up at a global scale. “I think we are seeing there is a global shortage so there is going to be room for multiple players,” Mr Crock said. He said Cann is well placed to remain at the forefront of the industry, thanks to a $78 million capital raising that will support expansion and ensure it has capacity to meet local and export needs. “We have got an expansion plan that we went to market and raised capital specifically for that and it really allows confidence to move forward,” he said.

Victoria's two newly elected upper house MPs from the Legalise Cannabis Party introduced a bill on Wednesday to change the Road Safety Act. Under the legislation, it would no longer be an offence for unimpaired drivers to have detectable tetrahydrocannabinol (TCH) - the primary psychoactive substance from cannabis - in their blood or oral fluid. They would have to carry a medicinal cannabis prescription and be taking the drug as prescribed to be legally permitted to get behind the wheel. In 2016, Victoria became the first state to approve medicinal cannabis but unimpaired users were not exempted if caught driving with the drug in their system. ""People who have been prescribed a medicine and can drive safely should be allowed to drive,"" Legalise Cannabis MP David Ettershank said. ""This is how we treat every single prescription medicine in Victoria, except medicinal cannabis, and its time for that to be corrected."" Medicinal cannabis patients can drive in Tasmania if unimpaired and fellow Legalise Cannabis MP Rachel Payne called on Victoria to follow suit. THC is known to stay in saliva for between a few hours and several days after use and is commonly found in the blood and urine samples of frequent users weeks after the initial effects have worn off. Alice Davy, who has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and endometriosis, said medicinal cannabis saved her life. ""Without this I wouldn't be able to get up in the morning to take my kids to school. I have THC at night and CBD (a nonpsychoactive component of cannabis) all day,"" she said. She used to take prescription benzodiazepine and would wake up so impaired she was unable to drive. ""That's a completely legal drug and cannabis isn't,"" Ms Davy said. Karen Hitchcock, a medicinal cannabis doctor, said many of her patients opted not to take medicinal cannabis to avoid the risk of losing their licence for six months. ""They can't drive their children around; they can't get to work,"" she said. ""I'm giving them care based on what are draconian rules that aren't actually evidence based or science based."" Premier Daniel Andrews said it was a challenging area of policy as there was no test to gauge a cannabis user's level of impairment, but the government was open to exploring solutions. ""I know its deeply frustrating for those who have advocated for some time,"" he said. ""The aim is to make sure that everyone for whom medicinal cannabis is an important part of their treatment regime ... (to) have no barriers to accessing that care.""

ONIX subsidiary OnixCann, a distributor of medical cannabis products in Brazil, will use its CANTERA digital health platform to deliver MGC’s products directly to patients. CANTERA facilitates legal access to medical cannabis products, while providing doctors and patients with guidance about the available treatments. MGC’s move into Brazil comes after it secured distributors for its products in Australia and the UK. In Australia, the company signed agreements with medicinal cannabis distribution and logistics specialists Health House International and Cannvalate. MGC also has signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Grow Biotech and IPS, who have an extensive network of 5,500 pharmacies across the UK. MGC Managing Director Roby Zomer said: “This distribution agreement with ONIX represents a milestone towards establishing MGC Pharma as a leading international producer of phytocannabinoid-based pharmaceutical products.” “Brazil represents a key emerging market and with the expected growth of the use of cannabis-based medicines in the region, it could become a significant market for the company.” Earlier this month, the company revealed that it had received additional product orders from Health House and Cannvalate that were 50% greater than their initial AUD$200,000 orders. This response was due to positive feedback from patients that led to doctors writing new prescriptions and several repeat prescriptions. Given this promising early result from MGC’s distribution agreements in Australia, the company will be hoping that similar efforts in Brazil could also pay off in the near term. Further highlighting this growth potential, specialist market insight provider, Prohibition Partners, has estimated that the Brazilian and Latin American medical cannabis market could be worth up to USD$8.5 billion by 2028.

They were planted at a secure hydroponic growing facility in the South West last month by phyto-pharmaceutical company Little Green Pharma. The private company expects to be harvesting by late March and sending resin to a manufacturing unit in Perth where it will be processed into an oil-based cannabis medication, ready for patients by mid-April. The plants are not all the same, with various strains aimed at providing different therapeutic effects — but not the big psychoactive high associated with recreational marijuana. Company managing director Fleta Solomon said indoor hydroponic plants tended to take 12 weeks to grow before their flowers were harvested for resin. The plants were now from10-40cm high. The two main types of medical cannabis plants being grown were sativa and indica, with hybrids in between. They had different concentrations of the cannabinoids THC and CBD as well as other compounds. “The sativa plant is tall with long, narrow leaves and tends to be more uplifting and invigorating, and is often prescribed for daytime use,” Ms Solomon said.  “Indica plants are shorter, denser and have broad leaves, and these strains tend to be more relaxing and are often prescribed before bedtime.”  Although they originated from similar plants, medical cannabis and recreational marijuana had little in common. “Many people are surprised to learn this,” she said.  Once the products were ready in April, they would be kept at the manufacturer until a patient presented a prescription to a pharmacy and the order was filled, she said. “It’s getting to a really exciting stage now and the biggest issue we probably have now is getting doctors to prescribe it. But I think in 12 months time the landscape will have changed quite a lot,” Ms Solomon said. “There’s also a bit of a misconception out there that it’s a synthetic product and just another pharmaceutical pill. But it’s not, it’s almost a herb, and we’re not allowed to modify the plants.” Company medical adviser and Perth GP Joe Kosterich said they were working with local medical specialists from neurology, cancer, palliative care and pain management disciplines to research the effects of different strains. Dr Kosterich said there was a lot of focus on the human endocannabinoid system, which was thought to regulate homeostasis, which is the balance of different bodily functions such as metabolism.

He said he had long advocated for medicinal cannabis with strict controls. “If available as part of approved treatment for particular problems, why not try it?” he said. “It’s not going to be open slather. “It will be properly produced and prescribed, with rules governing its use.” In a report inThe West Australian , Royal Australian College of General Practitioners president Dr Bastian Seidel said he doubted doctors would flock to cannabis because supporting evidence was “very limited”.

The global market for medicinal cannabis therapeutics has a projected worth of $US44 billion ($A55 billion) by 2024. CSIRO Scientist, Adjunct Professor Peter Duggan, says the new licence places the national science agency at the forefront of research into the development of new cannabis medicines. ""Around the world, researchers are exploring the potential for medicinal cannabis to help with conditions such as epilepsy and the nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy treatment, multiple sclerosis and chronic pain,"" he said in a statement on Thursday. ""We had been able to do early-stage work with cannabis but the new licence will enable us to develop cannabis-derived cannabinoid medicines using innovative extraction, refinement and formulation techniques."" The experienced botanical extracts team at CSIRO will develop cutting-edge cannabis products in their state-of-the-art lab. CSIRO is the only independent research institute in Australia able to develop drug manufacturing protocols in the medicinal cannabis space. This work will bridge the gap between the growing of plants and manufacture of medicines, with researchers developing the manufacturing protocols and preparing the first prototype products before transferring the technology to manufacturers for large scale production. The use of cannabis for medicinal purposes is highly regulated in Australia. In December the Therapeutic Goods Administration approved over-the-counter pharmacy sales of a low dose form of cannabidiol, one of the key components of cannabis that can help with a range of medical conditions. Oils, capsules, oral sprays, lozenges or other drug formats, can also be prescribed through the TGA's Special Access Scheme. There are more than 20 medicinal cannabis companies listed on the ASX and a growing number of licensed cultivators and manufacturers. Peter Crock, CEO of industry leading medicinal cannabis company, Cann Group, and Chair of Medicinal Cannabis Industry Australia, said the independent licence meant the CSIRO would be able to play a key role in helping establish a vibrant industry in Australia.

The company has received purchase orders for over 2,000 product units already, which will see revenues of around $270,000 realised. Co-founder and Managing Director of MGC Pharma, Roby Zomer, said: “The launch of Mercury Pharma brand and “MP100” so early in 2020 bodes well for the year ahead as MGC Pharma continues to follow its agenda to provide cost-effective affordable standardised phytocannabinoid based medicines to patients globally. “The Mercury Pharma brand brings an alternative affordable high CBD prescription medicine to the Australian and New Zealand markets only, as well as adding a new product line to MGC Pharma’s offering”. Cannabis plants contain about 500 chemical compounds with the two major cannabinoids or chemical compounds secreted in the cannabis plant being CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol, or “THC”. THC is the recreational, psychoactive and illegal cannabis drug. CBD, however, is not psychoactive, meaning it will not get the user ""high"" and comes with a rapidly developing suite of medicinal uses. According to the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, the most common uses of CBD are in the treatment of anxiety, schizophrenia, nausea, vomiting, inflammation and epilepsy. In 2018, the biopharma company received a manufacturing license for its cutting edge manufacturing facility in Slovenia to commence producing cannabis-based medicinal products. Since then it has established non-exclusive distribution agreements with Health House and Cannvalate, significantly improving the availability of its medical cannabis products under the Australian Special Access Scheme via an expanded network of clinics and pharmacies. Health House pioneered the medicinal cannabis sector as an international distributor and Cannvalate connects suppliers of medicinal cannabis with doctors and pharmacies COO of Cannvalate Pty Limited, Darryl Davies said: ""Cannvalate are delighted to introduce MGC Pharma's latest range across our network. MP100 is a high-quality, cost-effective medication option that we expect to be extremely well received by both prescribing physicians and patients. [MGC Pharmaceutical] continue to work towards lowering barriers for Australian patients and we expect this will be the start of significant growth in patient numbers for 2020."" CBD is legal in Australia under the Special Access [prescriptive] Scheme via doctors and MGC has permission from Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration to import its medicinal cannabis-based products for supply in either a clinical trial or under the Special Access Scheme. The Special Access Scheme allows health practitioners to access therapeutic goods that are not on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods for their patients under exceptional clinical circumstances.

Canndeo focuses on CBD formulations, which are not psychoactive and are used internationally by patients for a range of indications and symptoms including epilepsy, anxiety disorders, pain and inflammation. The white labelled cannabis-based pharmaceutical products will be sold under THC’s “Canndeo” brand in a liquid form and will contain a variety of CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol quantities that are produced in MGC’s Slovenian facility. Importantly, the new agreement will not compete with any of MCG’s existing cannabinoid products. The company has received its first purchase order for about €25,000 and the agreement provides for a minimum order quantity of €50,000. Co-founder and Managing Director of MGC Pharma, Roby Zomer, said: “The Supply Agreement with THC Global for the white label production and supply of pharma grade Canndeo branded products demonstrates MGC Pharma’s reputation, high quality and cost competitiveness in the ever-growing use of phytocannabinoids for medicinal purposes. “This new, and immediate, revenue stream will contribute to increasing revenues from Australia and New Zealand going into 2020, and we expect that further discussions between MGC Pharma and THC Global on mutual exports of product to respective international markets will be beneficial to the Company going forward, particularly as we develop our ~15,000m2 multi-purpose GMP certified pharma production and research facility in Malta.” According to the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, the most common uses of CBD are in the treatment of anxiety, schizophrenia, nausea, vomiting, inflammation and epilepsy.

Health Minister Sussan Ley will today announce changes to drug laws will be introduced to Parliament by the end of the year to license growers and allowing monitoring of products from “farm to pharmacy”. The proposed overhaul is being described as the missing link in legalising medical marijuana in Australia. Growing cannabis for medical and scientific use is banned in Australia under anti-drugs treaties but the changes to the Narcotic Drugs Act and the creation of a new regulator within the Federal Health Department will provide a legal and controlled crop. “This Government is incredibly sympathetic to the suffering of those Australians with debilitating illnesses and we want to enable access to the most effective medical treatments available,” Ms Ley said. “Currently there are already systems in place to licence the manufacture and supply of medicinal cannabis-based products in Australia, however there is no mechanism to allow the production of a safe, legal and sustainable local supply. “This has meant Australian patients, researchers and manufacturers have had to try to access international supplies of legal medicinal cannabis crops and products, but limited supplies and export barriers in other countries have made this difficult.” Medicinal cannabis has been used relieve pain for patients with a terminal illness, alleviate nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and control epileptic seizures. The Turnbull Government has been under pressure to act on legalising medical marijuana. NSW is leading a trial in the Eastern States to begin next year while Victoria plans to legalise its use by 2017. WA Health Minister Kim Hames revealed this week he was examining options for WA patients to participate in clinical trials. And a cross-party group of federal MPs, including Liberal backbenchers, are pushing their own Private Members’ Bill to establish a standalone regulator to license cultivation and approve products by year’s end. The Government’s approach would keep those roles separate, with the Health Department licensing growers and the Therapeutic Goods Administration responsible for registering products, just as it does with conventional medicines. “I’m sure Australians would be concerned if we allowed medicinal cannabis products to be subject to lower safety standards than common prescription painkillers or cholesterol medications,” Ms Ley said. She stressed that medicinal cannabis would not be available over-the-counter at pharmacies and she did not want today’s announcement was not a debate about legalising marijuana for recreational use.

https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/push-to-allow-medical-cannabis-for-lily-ng-ya-253399,Push to allow medical cannabis for Lily,"Saturday, 8 April 2023","A Perth mother yesterday confessed she had considered making cannabis oil to help relieve her daughter's pain symptoms but feared repercussions from child welfare authorities. Evidence of the medicinal benefits of cannabis in the form of sprays, tablets or oils is growing worldwide, but the products are illegal in Australia. Today, the Poulter family of five joined a push by WA Labor Leader Mark McGowan for medicinal cannabis to be prescribed in strictly controlled circumstances. BARNETT COULD SUPPORT MEDICINAL MARIJUANA | PUSH FOR MEDICAL CANNABIS ROLLS ON Mother Nicole Poulter said her daughter Lily, 9, had been prescribed a series of opiate drugs for more than two years including Lyrica, Oxynorm and Tramadol to treat the symptoms of two rare disorders. One is Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which causes Lily’s joints to regularly pop out of place, and the other is complex regional pain syndrome, which overstimulates nerves so the slightest touch is felt as pain. Mrs Poulter said the side effects of opiates on a small body were harsh and the family’s research led them to believe medicinal cannabis would be preferable. “It’s very heart-wrenching, as a parent, seeing your daughter go through so much pain,” she said. “I’ve researched how to make the oil but due to the fact that it is against the law, I can’t do it. We love our kids, we don’t want (Department of Child Protection and Family Support) involved.” Lily said: “If I had a genie I would only have one wish. To take the pain and the syndrome out of my life.” Health Minister Kim Hames has written to federal counterpart Peter Dutton recommending a Commonwealth-led trial of medicinal cannabis. He has said any new drugs on the market need to be approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, therefore a federal approach is needed.  Mr McGowan said one letter was not enough and Premier Colin Barnett should be raising the matter with Prime Minister Tony Abbott. “When I came out with this policy back in July (the State Government) accused me of being soft on drugs,” he said. “They seem to have changed their mind a little bit but it’s not good enough.” Sign up for our emails Find out More © West Australian Newspapers Limited 2023","Oct 5, 2014 ...

CSIRO is currently the only independent research institute in Australia able to develop drug manufacturing protocols in the medicinal cannabis space, and the agency has been granted a new licence to partner with local manufacturers to produce therapeutics. CSIRO scientist Professor Peter Duggan told The West Live the new licence would bridge the gap between growing the cannabis plants and turning the plants into medicines. “There’s already more than 20 (medicinal cannabis companies) on the stock exchange, and a number of private companies as well, so there is a huge amount of interest on the Australian scene,” Professor Duggan said. “But one of the issues is a lot of these companies have been focused on growing the plants, getting the right genetics, learning how to dry them, and there hasn’t been a lot of work on the next stage, which is producing actual medicines.” Professor Duggan said smoking a joint wasn’t an acceptable way to absorb medicinal cannabis in Australia, so the simplest vehicle for the delivery of such medicine is putting the cannabis extract in an oil, such as coconut oil. “That’s already been prescribed around Australia, but that’s pretty low technology,” Professor Duggan said. “Capsules or tablets are a slight extension on that, but there are a lot of other formats we’re expecting to be quite efficacious, like lozenges or wafers ... beverages, but there’s a lot of interest in trans-dermal delivery through the skin with creams and patches.” Researchers are exploring the potential for medicinal cannabis to help with conditions such as epilepsy and the nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy treatment, multiple sclerosis and chronic pain. Olivia Newton-John, who was diagnosed with stage four cancer in 2017, revealed last year that she and husband John Easterling, a plant medicine specialist, grow their own cannabis in a greenhouse on their property in California.  “I know Australia is a bit behind the rest of the world with cannabis but I’m hoping eventually Australia will realise that cannabis is a medicine and it can help people,” she said at the time. The use of cannabis for medicinal purposes is highly regulated in Australia. However, in December, the Therapeutic Goods Administration approved over-the-counter pharmacy sales of a low-dose form of cannabidiol (commonly abbreviated to “CBD”), one of the key components of cannabis that can help with a range of medical conditions. Professor Duggan said it was possible some people might try to exploit the system to obtain medicinal cannabis products for recreational purposes, as has been observed in America. “There are potential side-effects and potential drug interactions that can lead to unfortunate consequences, so it’s really important people who take these drugs do it through a physician,” he said. However, the CSIRO scientist said he couldn’t see Australia following in the footsteps of America, where CBD can now be found in beer, chocolate and a variety of readily available products. “There’s obviously a push for that in some parts of Australian society, but many medicinal cannabis companies are not keen on that because it complicates the whole thing and makes it difficult for the proper control and care of patients,” Professor Duggan said.

Just 2.5 years after being back-door listed into Erin Resources by Mitchell, a well connected West Perth corporate finance virtuoso, MGC has already developed its first medicinal cannabis product and built a cutting edge manufacturing facility in Slovenia. This week the company announced it had received a manufacturing license for that facility and it is now putting plans in place to commence production of its heralded medicinal cannabis product known as CannEpil. MGC developed CannEpil to assist epilepsy sufferers to control their epilepsy, particularly in circumstances where traditional drugs are having no impact. The company will now begin full scale manufacturing of its orally-administered CannEpil for final, independent validation before exportation into Australasia and Europe. According to MGC, drug resistant epilepsy accounts for around 30 per cent of the estimated 240,000 people diagnosed with epilepsy each year. Importantly CannEpil is already approved for use in Australia. The newly awarded manufacturing license allows MGC to immediately start production of pharmaceutical grade medical cannabis medicines containing both tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol active pharmaceutical ingredients. The manufacturing license was awarded to MGC after the company successfully applied for “good manufacturing practice” certification, which management says has now propelled its Slovenian facility into the upper echelons of the medicinal cannabis manufacturing industry in Europe. The company is now also able to design and produce additional good manufacturing practice grade medical cannabis medicines that target a range of conditions, many of which are currently on the drawing board at MGC. MGC managing director Roby Zomer said: “We are delighted to have been awarded our formal GMP Certificate and manufacturing licence and to commence production at our cutting edge European Facility, this is one more step in our Seed to Pharma strategy to become a leading BioPharma company with formulated medicines to sell into the global market.” The company’s Slovenian facility could soon be joined by another in Malta with the European island nation passing laws legalising the production of cannabis for medical use in May 2018. MGC only needs to sign formal agreements now with the Malta Medicine Authority to commence construction of another facility in that country. Medical cannabis from the Maltese operation will be used to produce GMP-grade pharmaceutical products at a commercial scale for sale into the EU market, which is expected to be worth $56 billion by 2020. MGC also got its foot in the door of the $265bn global cosmetics market last month when luxury UK retailer Harvey Nichols announced that it would stock its MGC Derma and Derma Plus medicinal cannabis cosmetics lines. Mitchell and his crew originally back-door listed MGC into Erin Resources at 2c a share with a starting market cap of around $14m. By January this year the stock was trading at 12.5c a share, delivering a tidy profit for Mitchell’s original believers. Whilst it is now trading off its highs at around 7c a share, MGC still boasts a market cap of around $76m – nearly 5.5 times the company’s starting market cap when the back-door listing was completed. MGC doesn’t appear to be a fluke either as Mitchell has similar form with telco tech play Sky and Space Global that he helped back-door list into Burleson Energy in May 2016 – also at 2c a share with a starting market cap of around $25m. Sky and Space is now trading at over 8c a share and has a market cap approaching $150m – once again, a 6 bagger for Mitchell’s original cohorts.

It comes amid proposed new laws for the state which would allow to users to drive with the drug detectable in their system. The bill was introduced to the upper house on Wednesday by members of the Legalise Cannabis Party which nabbed two seats at the last election. Among the changes to the Road Safety act would include it no longer being an offence for otherwise unimpaired drivers to have detectable tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in their blood or oral fluid. TCH is the primary psychoactive substance from cannabis. Dr Karen Hitchcock, who works as a GP specialising in medicinal cannabis, said Victoria’s current laws were pushing patients towards other prescription drugs. “I am referred patients with insomnia, often to assist them to withdraw from addictive drugs with overdose potential – benzodiazepines such as valium and temazepam, opiates, antipsychotics such as quetiapine, and hypnotics,” she said. Dr Hitchcock said a dose of cannabis oil before bed is “often all that is required” to treat symptoms but this can stay in a driver’s system after “the effects of the cannabis have long abated”. “Unfortunately by morning, the patient may still have traces of THC in their saliva, and it may be detected in their blood for weeks,” she said. “Many patients choose to stay on their more dangerous and more addictive medications because of the driving laws. Others take a risk, as the relief and increase in quality of life now that they are sleeping soundly are worth the risk of losing their licence. Dr Hitchcock went on to say the current laws could cause pain-stricken drivers to become a danger on the roads due to a lack of sleep. “Sleep deprivation, we know, grossly impairs driving ability. It is time the laws were changed to reflect the reality that cannabis is a medicine,” she said. “It is time we stopped mistaking innocent citizens for criminals”. Legalise Cannabis Victoria MP David Ettershank, who represents the Western Metropolitan region, said the laws should be focused on impairment, not just THC being present. “People who have been prescribed a medicine and can drive safely should be allowed to drive – this is how we treat every single prescription medicine in Victoria, except medicinal cannabis, and it’s time for that to be corrected,” he said. “Testing for the sheer presence of THC rather than impairment is not right. This failure is based on stigma rather than evidence and the law for cannabis needs to be brought in line with all other prescription medicines.” Currently, Tasmania is the only state which provides a medical defence for driving with the presence of THC in bodily fluids. This is only applicable if the medicinal cannabis is obtained and administered in accordance with state laws. In response to a Bill on the issue in 2019, the Victorian government established the Medicinal Cannabis and Safe Driving Working Group and commissioned research into its potential impact.

Dr Neale Fong, a former WA director-general of health, sits on its advisory board, and Perth GP Joe Kosterich is a medical adviser.  Little Green Pharma managing director Fleta Solomon said 13 companies were licensed to produce medical cannabis in Australia but only a few had a permit to start production. Her company was the only one in WA with a licence and permit to grow plants locally.  It had taken six months of work for it to reach cultivation stage this week. It had developed a novel delivery system which allowed patients to use a “micro dose”.  The products would be manufactured at a local licensed facility monitored by health authorities. The company also planned to start research on the use of medical cannabis with several WA and overseas research institutions.

https://thewest.com.au/business/public-companies/mgc-grows-medical-cannabis-patient-numbers-c-460162,MGC grows medical cannabis patient numbers,"Saturday, 8 April 2023","MGC Pharmaceuticals continues to grow its medicinal, cannabis-based pharmaceutical products business globally, recently racking up its 200th patient that has either prescribed for, or is being processed to receive prescriptions of its medical cannabis-based products in both Australia and the UK. Notably, the company has effectively doubled its number of patients over the last month and the recent milestone appears to underline its strengthening position in those markets. MGC has managed to create a demand for its proprietary, standardised and remarkably affordable medicines on a global scale within a relatively short period of time. The company’s products, CannEpil and MXP100 are prescribed in Australia under the Special Access Scheme and in the UK through specialised doctors permitted to prescribe phytocannabinoid-derived medicines under the Early Access to Medicines Scheme. CannEpil is the company’s high cannabidiol, or “CBD”, and low tetrahydrocannabinol, or “THC”, phytocannabinoid-derived formulation, used in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Management also said that Cannabis Access Clinics has recently joined fellow Australian, Tetra Health, as one of the company’s key clinical partners, which will expand the network of medical professionals informed of its available product range. MGC has a “seed to pharmacy” strategy that closes the loop for its medicinal cannabis products, with the company on track to significantly increase production capacity after recently signing a long-term lease agreement with Maltese Government-owned Malta Industrial Parks Limited, for a 6,000 square metre site to cultivate cannabis plants. The company has already begun site works for the fully-integrated, multi-storey building that will contain 15,000 square metres of space for the cultivation and manufacture of cannabinoid-derived medicines for its proposed global distribution networks. Roby Zomer, Managing Director of MGC Pharma said: “Having progressed CannEpil and MXP100 from the Research & Development stages through to commercialisation, we now have a proven process in which we can advance additional standardised, affordable phytocannabinoid-derived medicines.” “We anticipate the uptake of patients to continue to increase accordingly, providing revenue to invest further in new production and our Research & Development strategies, as well as cementing MGC Pharma has a key player in the medical cannabis sector globally.” NB: This article is for general financial markets news purposes only and is not to be taken as an endorsement of, or advertisement for any individual product, medicine or drug.

https://thewest.com.au/business/aust-medicinal-cannabis-ships-to-europe-ng-s-2046259,Aust medicinal cannabis ships to Europe,"Saturday, 8 April 2023","Australia has broken into the European medicinal cannabis market with the first batch in a decade-long, multi-million deal on its way to Germany. The $92 million export agreement marks the start of a trade partnership with the region, which is forecast to become the world's largest legal market. Health Minister Greg Hunt says Australia is poised to become a recognised leader in the global supply of the highest quality medicinal cannabis products. ""Australia's gold-standard regulation of medicinal cannabis products, coupled with a premium agricultural and manufacturing industry, means we are well positioned to become a preferred supplier,"" Mr Hunt said on Thursday. ""This has the potential to create jobs and boost economic growth in Australia as we look to new and different export channels."" The 10-year deal will initially see about two tonnes of locally grown and dried cannabis flowers shipped over the next 18 months. ""This is a major win for the industry in Australia,"" Australian Natural Therapeutics Group chief executive Matt Cantelo said. ""While the German cannabis industry is still in its infancy, it is (already) the third-largest market globally behind the US and Canada"". ANTG are the first local growers to crack the EU market, which currently receives the majority of imported products from Canada and The Netherlands. ""Now that we have the gold standard in growing and manufacturing medicinal cannabis - in line with the most stringent in the world - it means our product also qualifies for export to every other nation,"" Mr Cantelo said. The market for medicinal cannabis in Germany is expected to grow rapidly in the next decade and reach $12.4 billion by 2028, according to ANTG. Mr Cantelo said Australia's tough regulatory framework had set the local industry up as the best in the world. ""Australia also has the reputation and climate for growing excellent produce in general - it makes sense that we would produce the highest quality, non-irradiated medicinal cannabis product as well,"" he said. Federal parliament in June passed legislation authorising the export of medicinal cannabis and hemp into more overseas markets. It gives farmers access to export opportunities in Southeast Asia, China, Canada and the lucrative US market, along with Europe. The new laws also mean Australia will be able to certify legitimate exports of narcotic products, helping producers export to countries and regions that need government approval, such as the European Union, which holds the strictest regulations on imports.

In an update to the market on Thursday, MGC said that following due diligence it had executed the revised acquisition agreement, which would see the Perth-based company acquire up to 100 per cent of Panax – a highly connected player in the Czech Republic’s medicinal cannabis industry. Importantly, Panax holds research access rights to the Czech Republic’s Institution of Experimental Botany of Academy of Sciences, which has a cannabis breeding licence from the Ministry of Health in the Czech Republic. The new deal gives MGC Pharma access to these facilities for its medical cannabis research. The acquisition, which enables MGC to commence research operations in January 2017, also means the company will likely be able to boost its research production, with a scale up to 1,000m2 of greenhouse growing space on the cards for its medical grade marijuana, company management said this week. Under the agreement with PANAX, MGC Pharma will receive 25 per cent equity issued up front at no cost to MGC. A further 55 per cent equity in Panax will be issued to MGC in return for MGC’s commitment to fund operating costs for the next 12 months up to €700,000 (AU991,759.04). MGC will have an option to acquire the final 20 per cent equity in Panax by issuing €600,000 worth of MGC shares, a substantially better deal than the original agreement which would have seen MGC pay €800,000 for the final 20 per cent equity in Panax. MGC co-founder and managing director Nativ Segev said: “This acquisition will strengthen our research capabilities and we intend to conduct research on our medical cannabis strains in the facility which has the potential to be used in the coming Pharmaceutical products and clinical trials, both in Europe and in Australia.” MGC is a unique player in the burgeoning global medical cannabis industry. It has a traditional medical research program and is has also achieved first revenues from its unique cannabis based cosmetic lines. The company, which has Israeli executives and is backed by Perth corporate players, said that it was in a strong cash position of around $6.2 million as at 30 September 2016 and was fully funded to execute its growth objectives.

Under the terms of the deal, MMJ’s Canadian subsidiary United Greeneries and Swiss subsidiary Satipharm will be rolled into the TSX-V-listed shell of Top Strike Resources. In return, Top Strike will pay MMJ $C2.5 million in cash and $C37.5 million in shares (300 million shares at 12.5 Canadian cents). Top Strike will concurrently undertake a $C15 million equity raising. MMJ's management will be responsible for the operations of the new entity. MMJ said the deal would provide its shareholders with exposure to the rapidly growing recreational and medicinal cannabis markets in Canada, which are expected to be worth $C8 billion by 2024. There are already 34 approved medicinal marijuana companies operating in Canada, 10 of which are publicly listed. MMJ said Canada had one of the most highly regulated and favourable operating jurisdictions for medicinal marijuana in the world. The company is also expecting considerable upside from a new regulatory system for recreational cannabis expected to be introduced in the second half of next calendar year. MMJ’s managing director Andreas Gedeon said the company’s decision to pursue the listing of United Greeneries and Satipharm on the TSX-V would be a transformational transaction for the company. “The transaction provides MMJ shareholders with the opportunity to benefit from the significant value currently being realised by TSX-V listed cannabis producers such as Aphria, Canopy and Aurora,” he said. “The board has been assessing the merits of obtaining a public listing in Canada for some time, and Top Strike represents a compelling and timely opportunity.  “MMJ shareholders will continue to benefit post transaction, from indirect exposure to the rapidly expanding Canadian cannabis market, and near-term revenues generated from increased Satipharm sales through key regulated markets globally.” MMJ’s United Greeneries already has cannabis growing facilities in Canada and its Swiss subsidiary Satipharm has a number of key international distribution partnerships for the distribution of cannabinoid-based pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and wellness products. The deal is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval as well as due diligence, financing and a definitive agreement.

https://thewest.com.au/business/public-companies/mgc-clinches-key-uk-medical-cannabis-deal-c-1245091,MGC clinches key UK medical cannabis deal,"Saturday, 8 April 2023","ASX-listed medicinal cannabis player, MGC Pharmaceuticals, has snared a key UK distribution agreement with leading UK medicinal cannabis provider, LYPHE Group, for MGC Pharma’s cannabinoid medicines that will see its products delivered directly to patients. MGC has notched up a few significant milestones recently – including an import licence and cannabis research cultivation permit from the Australian Office of Drug Control – as it looks to fill the gaps of its “nature to medicine” business strategy. The company says LYPHE has already ordered an initial shipment of MGC Pharma’s Mercury Pharma line of products. MGC Pharma’s product offerings target two widespread medical conditions, epilepsy and dementia. Under the terms of the agreement, London-based LYPHE will prescribe and dispense Mercury Pharma medicinal cannabis products under LYPHE labels to patients at its clinics. LYPHE’s recent collaboration with pharmaceuticals supplier, Eaststone, one of the UK’s leaders in the supply of cannabinoid medicines, will also open the door for MGC Pharma to Eaststone’s network of more than 700 pharmacies that the Greater Manchester-based firm services across the UK. The first commercial order from LYPHE – who, according to MGC Pharma, currently writes more than half of all new prescriptions for medicinal cannabis in the UK – is the largest single order for MGC Pharma into the UK to date. Importantly, the company says, it represents a valuable commercial channel into the UK and a key stepping stone towards meeting its objective of supplying quality phytocannabinoid-derived medicines for growing demand in the UK, Europe, North America and Australasia markets. MGC Pharma’s products will be registered in UK through LYPHE and delivered directly to the end patient. Last week, MGC Pharma revealed its natural supplement “ArtemiC” is being analysed in the global fight against Coronavirus, with results from pre-clinical in-vitro laboratory testing in Israel suggesting it can reduce the risk of inflammation at the very least. Some elements of the ArtemiC formulation showed it was effective in modifying the function of human immune cells in response to inflammatory stimuli. Whilst it still has more work to do on its COVID-19 strategy, MGC Pharma is well in the mix of global companies racing to find a way to deal with the ravages of the Coronavirus and the latest deal with LYPHE gives it a solid presence in the all-important UK market.

IHPS is a public research, developmental, advisory and educational organisation principally focussed on research and advice in growing plants. The two parties were granted a first of its kind approval by the Slovenian Government to carry out research on the cultivation of cannabis for medical purposes, which MGC expects to lower its production costs. The research will also seek to standardise the process for isolating and extracting an active pharmaceutical ingredient of various phytocannabinoids for use in the development of medicinal products. Management said that research would focus on the positive and negative selection of various genotypes in the cannabis plant to extract an active pharmaceutical ingredient for use in the development of a medical product. The project will be carried out at IHPS’ large-scale secure facility, which includes a quarantine base for the cultivation of various strains of cannabis for medical purposes for use in pharmaceutical manufacturing, in addition to a controlled storage facility. MGC Managing Director Roby Zomer said: “The objective of the research project is twofold – the optimisation of cultivation techniques and the isolation of an active pharmaceutical ingredient from the cannabis plant that can be utilised in the future development of medical products by the company …” “This furthers MGC’s agenda of working to create cutting edge, cost-effective standardised medicines to treat underserved indications around the world, and to maintain our position as market leaders in research and tapping the full emerging potential of diverse phytocannabinoids as active pharmaceutical ingredients.” MGC recently raised $4.75 million through a share placement priced at 4 cents per share to fund its ongoing production operations, sales of pharmaceutical-grade cannabinoid derived medicines and initial construction works on its Malta Good Manufacturing Practice Pharma facility. The company has also inked a milestone lease for a 6,000 square metre site to house its fully-integrated, multi-storey Malta facility, which will have 15,000 square metres of floor space available for the cultivation and manufacture of cannabinoid-derived medicines for global distribution. This facility will be capable of producing over 8,000 units of each MGC pharmaceutical product per hour, which is a material production volume for the pharmaceutical industry, according to the company.

Slovenian authorities inspected the facility during January before granting a penultimate approval certificate that brings an important 18-month process to the brink of closure for the company. The latest approval sets MGC Pharma on a pathway towards the production of CannEpil, the company’s first pharmaceutical-grade medical cannabis product to be used for the relief of drug-resistant epilepsy, also known as refractory epilepsy. This form of epilepsy accounts for approximately 30% of the estimated 240,000 people diagnosed with epilepsy in Australia each year, the company said. MGC Pharma said, ‘This full GMP licence will enable MGC Pharma to commence full-scale manufacture and to be licensed for distribution and CannEpil as well as other pharmaceutical grade medicinal cannabis products.’ ‘GMP certification provides MGC Pharma with a significant competitive advantage to access key European and global markets, to be one of the most advanced medicinal cannabis production facilities in Europe.’ The interim licence for the facility is expected to be upgraded to full certification once the first batch of CannEpil has met additional protocols defined by a post-production validation process. MGC also announced it had signed an agreement with specialist Australian pharmaceutical distributor HL Pharma to bring CannEpil to the Australian market. Under the agreement MGC Pharma will be responsible for securing Therapeutic Goods Administration and Office of Drug Control approval to import and supply the products in Australia.

The women self-reported positive outcomes in using cannabis to manage the often painful condition, in which tissue similar to that which lines the uterus grows beyond it causing inflammation and scarring. It is estimated that one in nine Australian women has endometriosis. Just 23 per cent of the 186 Australian respondents accessed cannabis through a doctor's prescription, the study, published in the journal of Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research found. Medicinal cannabis was approved for use in Australia in 2016. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has said the majority of patients who seek medicinal cannabis do so for pain management but that the evidence for many painful conditions is still limited. The administration does not consider medical cannabis a ""first-line therapy"" for any illness, meaning other treatments should be considered first. Chief Scientific Officer with the Australian Natural Therapeutics Group and lead author Justin Sinclair said there was still stigma around medical cannabis and he was concerned people were using cannabis without medical supervision. ""A number of factors, including concern surrounding possible legal repercussions, judgement from either their doctor or society, or their doctors' presumed unwillingness to prescribe legal medicinal cannabis were the main reasons for not talking to their doctor,"" Mr Sinclair said. ""Improving doctor and patient communication about medicinal cannabis use may improve levels of medical oversight, the preference for legal medicinal cannabis adoption over acquisition via illicit supply and reducing cannabis-associated stigma.""

https://thewest.com.au/news/australia/little-proof-of-medicinal-pot-benefit-ng-ya-121980,‘Little proof’ of medicinal pot benefit,"Saturday, 8 April 2023","Medicinal cannabis can have negative side effects and there is little evidence of its medical benefits, WA’s top public health official said yesterday. But executive director of Public Health Tarun Weeramanthri said WA’s decision to allow cannabis-derived products to be prescribed as a controlled drug, and to be grown and manufactured for that purpose, would lead to better research and a safer supply chain. EDITORIAL: Medicinal cannabis sends wrong message on drug use The Health Department’s Healthy WA website says acute side effects of cannabis include “vomiting, impaired co-ordination and performance, anxiety, suicidal ideation and psychotic symptoms”, and “side effects of cannabis used for medicinal purposes are not well understood”. On Tuesday, medicinal cannabis will be reclassified from a schedule 9 prohibited substance to a schedule 8 controlled drug, and new products are expected to be available from early next year. Dr Weeramanthri said at first it would be prescribed only by specialists as a “last resort medication for people with complex conditions that have not responded to other means”. He said there was “limited, but some evidence” medicinal cannabis could be effective to treat conditions such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, cancer and appetite loss. “There’s currently great difficulty in obtaining such pharmaceutical products from overseas and part of the reason the Commonwealth has allowed growing in Australia is to improve the supply of such products,” he said. Labor Leader Mark McGowan complained he had been labelled “soft on drugs” by the Barnett Government when in 2014 he proposed legalising medicinal cannabis. “They have been dragged kicking and screaming to follow our lead,” he said. Health Minister John Day said: “The world has moved on, there’s now national legislation in place and an acceptance ... it is appropriate for there to be pharmaceuticals available where they may assist patients but really to allow further research.” Sign up for our emails Find out More © West Australian Newspapers Limited 2023","Oct 28, 2016 ...

The company accepted $2 million in oversubscriptions on the placement priced at a discounted 20.5 cents. MMJ plans to spin-off its two subsidiaries United Greeneries Holdings and Satipharm in TSE-listed Top Strike Resources. The board hopes the new entity will be trading on the TSE by the end of the year subject to due diligence and shareholder approval. MMJ said the better than expected result from the placement might mean that the company would be able to reduce the cash component of the transaction with Top Strike, enabling it to secure a greater equity interest in the company. MMJ PhytoTech managing director Andreas Gedeon said the company was pleased to have secured this additional funding, and support from a number of well-known institutional investors. “Their participation in this placement further validates our near-term strategy to fast-track the growth of our core cannabis brands on the TSX-V, and provides the requisite financial flexibility to execute this process,” he said. MMJ last month announced a $40 million deal to backdoor-list its two subsidiaries on the TSE-V. MMJ's management will be responsible for the operations of the new entity. MMJ said the deal would provide its shareholders with exposure to the rapidly growing recreational and medicinal cannabis markets in Canada, which are expected to be worth $C8 billion by 2024. There are already 34 approved medicinal marijuana companies operating in Canada, 10 of which are publicly listed. MMJ said Canada had one of the most highly regulated and favourable operating jurisdictions for medicinal marijuana in the world. The company is also expecting considerable upside from a new regulatory system for recreational cannabis expected to be introduced in the second half of next calendar year. MMJ’s United Greeneries already has cannabis growing facilities in Canada and its Swiss subsidiary Satipharm has a number of key international distribution partnerships for the distribution of cannabinoid-based pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and wellness products.

https://thewest.com.au/politics/medicinal-cannabis-set-to-be-easier-to-get-ng-s-1736743,Senate scraps rules on medicinal cannabis,"Saturday, 8 April 2023","Terminally-ill patients waiting months to access medicinal cannabis could have that slashed to just hours after a backflip by crossbench senators. The Greens have succeeded in scrapping rules which made it harder for dying patients to access medical cannabis after a failed attempt in May. The changes mean terminally-ill patients will get quicker, easier access to medicinal cannabis, prescribed by a doctor, by allowing access under the Therapeutic Goods Administration category A list. Access is now available under category B, which the Greens say can take months for approval. Tuesday's vote came after One Nation and independent Jacqui Lambie backtracked on their original positions, teaming up with Labor and the Greens to defeat the government. Pauline Hanson claims she initially voted against the move because she was deceived by the government, saying she was falsely assured terminally-ill patients had access to adequate supplies of the drug. ""I was not informed correctly by the government,"" she told the Senate. She rejected government claims that axing the rules would allow unsafe, uncontrolled importation of cannabis into Australia. Health Minister Greg Hunt slammed the change as reckless and irresponsible, saying it will remove protections against unsafe medicinal cannabis that could be diverted for criminal use. The move was in defiance of advice from the medicines regulator. ""The Therapeutic Goods Administration could not be clearer that it is a potential risk, not just to health, but to lives,"" Mr Hunt told reporters in Canberra. ""There is already a safe, legal way to access medicinal cannabis in Australia - 133 patients have been prescribed that."" Greens leader Richard Di Natale labelled the government's complaints ""utter nonsense"". ""What this change does is ... if you've got a terminal illness you can go and see a GP and if the drug is not available here in Australia, they can order it for you and you can source it from other regulated markets,"" he said. Opposition health spokeswoman Catherine King said it was a win for dying Australians. ""We now hope the government gets on with the job of implementing a national scheme and stop scaremongering and stigmatising the people who are trying to access medicinal cannabis,"" she said. Doctors warn the move will undermine the existing, safe process for the sake of political point-scoring. ""When it comes to medicinal cannabis we need to keep politics needs out of healthcare,"" Royal Australian College of GPs president Bastian Seidel said. ""This change undermines the reporting and monitoring processes to the detriment of patients and their doctors.""

The federal government has given the green light for approved companies to legally import, store and sell the drug until domestic production meets local needs. The move will make it easier for patients who now must go through a lengthy process to get cannabis from overseas once prescribed by an authorised doctor. Health Minister Greg Hunt says those with profound conditions or palliative care needs will instead be able to access safe, high-quality and appropriately-obtained medication within days. ""It is time that they have the care that they need, the drugs that are prescribed by medical professionals, and that they are actually available,"" he told reporters in Sydney on Wednesday. Once approved, commercial importers will be allowed to source medicinal cannabis products from a reputable international supplier and store it in a secure warehouse. It's expected Australia will have a continuous supply of medicinal cannabis within eight weeks. That will help fill the gap until local production - which was legalised late last year - ramps up. The first licence for private cultivation was only issued last week. Victoria expects locally-sourced medicinal cannabis to be available by the middle of the year or a little bit later. ""We want to make supply available but it has to be legal,"" Mr Hunt said. ""It has to be safe and we want to make sure this medicinal cannabis is available but on the same basis as any of the serious drugs and medicines that can only be dealt with through prescription and through a very rigorous medical process."" Labor welcomed the move, after Bill Shorten last week wrote to the prime minister calling for the government to regulate overseas supply. Opposition health spokeswoman Catherine King said she hoped the fast-tracked importation will immediately improve access to medicinal cannabis. ""However it should be noted there are still unanswered questions around the other barriers to access, such as patients' access to doctors who can prescribe medicinal cannabis,"" she said in a statement.

https://thewest.com.au/business/public-companies/mgc-cranks-up-medical-cannabis-orders-c-164634,MGC cranks up medical cannabis orders,"Saturday, 8 April 2023","MGC Pharmaceuticals has received early signs of revenue growth from its medical cannabis business with the company already receiving additional product orders under its agreements with Australian distributors Health House International and Cannvalate. The company has just completed an initial order of $200,000 of cannabis-based pharmaceutical products to the distributors and has received another order that will provide an additional $100,000 to the company’s revenue in the September quarter. Management said this was due to positive feedback from patients that led to doctors writing new prescriptions and a number of repeat prescriptions. Under the non-exclusive distribution agreements, Health House and Cannvalate will improve the availability of MGC’s medical cannabis products under the Special Access Scheme via an expanded network of clinics and pharmacies. MGC has permission from Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration to import its medicinal cannabis-based products for supply for use in either a clinical trial or under the Special Access Scheme, which allows health practitioners to access therapeutic goods that are not in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods for their patients under exceptional clinical circumstances. Health House wholesales and distributes medicinal cannabis products in Australia and the UK to community and hospital pharmacies while Cannvalate is Australia’s largest network of cannabis prescribers and dispensaries with over 1000 doctors and more than 600 pharmacies. The increasing orders for MGC’s medical cannabis products follow closely on the heels on the receipt of a $700,000 purchase order from Canadian cannabis investment company CannaGlobal for cannabis-based cosmetic raw materials earlier this month. Separately, MGC now expects to conclude the Phase II clinical trial for its “CogniCann” medical cannabis product for the treatment of dementia and Alzheimer’s patients in the second quarter of 2020, about 12 months ahead of schedule. This is due to the unexpectedly high level of interest from potential candidates to participate in the trial. The Good Manufacturing Practice certified CogniCann would be tested on 50 participants aged 65 years and older over an 18-week period to assess the effects of the treatment on the symptoms of mild dementia and Alzheimer’s and the improvement of patient’s quality of life. A series of pre and post treatment surveys and focus groups will also be carried out to assess care givers and family member’s knowledge and perceptions towards the use of the treatment. Managing Director Roby Zomer said: “We have already been reaping the commercial benefits of the signed distribution agreements with Health House International and Cannvalate with first material revenues coming from initial orders in addition to experiencing a significant increase in product orders.” “This is testament to the quality and affordability of MGC Pharma’s products that ensure doctors remain confident when prescribing to patients and reflects strong immediate demand from the market.” Mr Zomer added that the unanticipated level of demand to participate in the Phase II clinical trial for CogniCann demonstrated the considerable interest in medical cannabis and growing awareness in its potential medicinal benefits. “The volume of applications has meant that the recruitment process will not take as long as originally anticipated and will result in a considerable time saving for the completion of the study which we now look to complete in Q2 2020, significantly ahead of schedule,” he added.

In a market update on Monday, MGC said final legislation legalising the production of cannabis for medical use in Malta had passed through Parliament, paving the way for the company to build a fully licensed medicinal cannabis manufacturing facility there. The landmark legislation represents a significant milestone for MGC on its mission to build a medical cannabis facility in Malta after the Maltese Government awarded it a contract to construct the facility last month. The passing of legislation through Malta’s Parliament takes MGC closer to commencing construction of the facility, with the company now only needing to sign formal agreements with the Malta Medicine Authority in the coming weeks to finalise the deal. Under the contract with Malta Enterprise, the Government agency responsible for attracting Foreign Investment in Malta, MGC is proposing to construct a 4,000 square metre facility with land already earmarked for the project. The company wants to build the Cannabis growing lab as a base to launch into the EU market, which is expected to be worth $56 billion by 2020. MGC CEO Roby Zomer said: “I am pleased to inform you that the production of cannabis for medical use has now become legal and regulated under Maltese legislation and a plot of land within one of the Maltese industrial zones has been designated to us for our project.” “Once the licence by the Malta Medicines Authority is issued we will be able to commence work on the project in Malta.” Malta represents an ideal location for the facility too because of its good growing climate, relatively low-cost environment and proximity to EU nations like Germany where demand for medicinal marijuana is particularly explosive. According to company management, medical cannabis from the Maltese operation will be used to produce GMP-grade pharmaceutical products at a commercial scale. This week’s announcement comes after the Perth-listed company recently raised $5 million via a share placement to fund the proposed lab, leaving it with $12 million cash in the bank to fund its growth agenda through the rest of the year. MGC is one of only a handful of companies - and the sole Australian company - to be awarded a full medical cannabis production and cultivation contract in Malta, following a competitive tender process there.

AusCann, whose chairman is former WA Federal Liberal MP Mal Washer, has been granted a manufacturing licence by the Office of Drug Control, paving the way for it to not only grow but also make cannabinoid medical products. The company was given approval in May for a secure outdoor cultivation facility in WA, with the intention of having its first locally grown product ready next year. Until its cultivation facility is operating in WA, the company said it would import medical cannabis from Chile in partnership with Canopy Growth Corporation, one of Canada’s biggest medicinal cannabis companies. AusCann managing director Elaine Darby said the latest approval was a major milestone in the company’s bid to be a leading supplier of high quality and affordable medicinal cannabis for Australian patients. The company has a cultivation licence in both WA and Tasmania and now a manufacturing one in WA. Dr Darby said the new licence completed the supply chain for the company. “Securing both a cultivation and a manufacturing licence will enable us to achieve this aim,” she said. “In preparation for the supply of Australian-produced medicines, AusCann has been actively engaged with the medical community through its educational and medical outreach program.” Despite groups including the Australian Medical Association urging caution in the push for medical cannabis products, Dr Darby said the company had made progress in gaining support from the medical community.

Perth-based MGC said on Friday that the changes, revealed earlier this week by Health Minister Greg Hunt, meant it would now accelerate plans to develop a pharmaceutical grade medicinal cannabis cultivation and manufacturing strategy in Australia, to complement its existing operations in Europe. The ASX Junior said the long-awaited policy shift opened up the opportunity for it to sell its breakthrough cannabis-based epilepsy treatment, CannEpil into global markets via its Australian operation. According to MGC management, the set-up of an Australian manufacturing operation would provide the company with significant cost and logistics advantages when it came to targeting both local buyers and key Asia Pacific markets compared to sourcing product from its European operations based in Slovenia. “MGC CEO Roby Zomer said: “This is positive news for the emerging Australian medicinal cannabis industry and we welcome the move by the federal government to further establish a clear legislative and regulatory framework around exporting products to support domestic producers. “Australia has such a strong reputation globally as a leader in agriculture, agricultural innovation and pharmaceutical products. It is only natural that the country is positioning itself to be a world leader in the medicinal cannabis industry.” Under the changes, the regulations that outlaw exports of medicinal cannabis products will be altered once federal parliament resumes next month. The latest changes follow 2017 amendments that allowed for the controlled importation of medical cannabis products by approved suppliers from international sources. The upcoming changes cover cannabis-based treatments like CannEpil, already approved for use in Australia, as well as various oils, sprays, patches, lozenges and tablets that can relieve pain and ease symptoms of medical conditions. The policy easing comes after MGC revealed in November that its unique marijuana-derived epilepsy treatment, CannEpil, would be available to Australian patients in 2018 from authorised doctors. MGC expects to generate about $1 million per year from the less then 100 patients already registered for the product targeted at drug-resistant epilepsy.

The agreement aims to promote and encourage collaborative activity to improve the offerings of both CannPal and Zelda and exploit opportunities of mutual interest in both the human and animal pharmaceutical markets. Zelda said the deal would provide it with meaningful exposure to the large and growing animal health market. Zelda’s executive chairman Harry Karelis said the partnership effectively outsourced Zelda’s animal studies while retaining the company’s focus on human studies for a zero cost. “There are tremendous opportunities in the rapidly expanding global medical cannabis sector and this strategic partnership reaffirms Zelda’s position as a leader in the field of cannabis based medicines,” he said.

MGC said it had settled on a binding heads of agreement to acquire up to 100 per cent equity in Panax following due diligence on the acquisition and the finalisation of a research deal with the Czech Republic’s Institute of Experimental Botany of Academy of Sciences known as “IEBAS”. In an update to the market on Tuesday, the Perth-based company said the next step following the acquisition would be to work collaboratively with Panax executives to develop a medical cannabis genetics and breeding program. One of the major upsides for MGC from the deal is that Panax, a well connected player in the Czech Republic’s medicinal cannabis industry, holds research access rights to IEBAS, which has a cannabis breeding licence from the Ministry of Health in the Czech Republic. As a result of the acquisition, MGC can access IEBAS’ world renowned medical cannabis research facilities in Prague. Specifically, the links between IEBAS and Panax mean that MGC will be able to conduct medical cannabis breeding research at IEBAS’s labs and scale up to 1,000m2 of greenhouse growing space, with ability for further scale up if needed. MGC co-founder and managing director Nativ Segev said: “We are pleased to announce that our acquisition of Panax is complete. MGC Pharmaceuticals will now immediately commence its research operations at the world-class Institute of Experimental Botany of Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. ” Under the acquisition deal, 25 per cent equity in Panax was immediately issued to MGC while a further 55 per cent equity was issued for MGC’s commitment to fund operating costs for the next 12 months, capped at €700,000. MGC has an option to acquire the final 20 per cent equity in Panax by issuing €600,000 worth of MGC shares. MGC is confident the deal will strengthen its medical research program that is being developed alongside its cannabis-based cosmetic and dermatological lines targeted at the booming global market for marijuana-derived products.

It came as a Greens bid to speed up access to medicinal marijuana passed its first parliamentary hurdle, bringing terminally ill patients one step closer to securing access to imported and Australian-grown products under the Therapeutic Goods Administration category A list. Patients can already get the drug through category B of the Special Access Scheme, which is a longer and more arduous process, but Liberal Democrats senator David Leyonhjelm told the Senate the Government had “blood on its hands” for not making access easier. The Bill will now go before the Lower House, where it faces an uncertain future because of the Government’s one-seat majority. Greens leader Richard Di Natale, who proposed the Bill, urged Government MPs to cross the floor to pass the changes.  “It is simply cruelty from this Government,” Senator Di Natale said. Ahead of his talk sponsored by the WA Clinical Oncology Group, Professor Grimison said there was some evidence medical cannabis could help patients having chemotherapy control side effects including nausea. “There is the hope that it will help to relieve cancer symptoms and the great hope it will cure cancer but the current evidence is limited, which is why it is important to do more research,” Professor Grimison said. “If we get some clinical trials with more reliable evidence, it’s more likely doctors will prescribe it in patients.” Preliminary results from the University of Sydney pilot study of 80 chemotherapy patients were expected next year and if they were positive, a larger trial would start.

https://thewest.com.au/news/medicine/cannabis-driving-less-risk-than-some-drugs-c-3088753,Cannabis driving less risk than some drugs,"Saturday, 8 April 2023","The risks of driving after taking medicinal cannabis are the same or lower than for many other prescription drugs, research shows. ""The risk is probably considerably less than with many medications such as antidepressants, opioids and benzodiazepines,"" Professor Iain McGregor from The Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics at the University of Sydney told AAP. His analysis, published in the International Journal of Drug Policy, shows other prescription drugs such as opioids and benzodiazepines can more than double the risk of crashing. By contrast, previous studies have shown drivers testing positive for cannabis have a slightly increased crash risk (of 1.1 to 1.4), while other recent research has shown no increased risk at all. Prof McGregor said the scenario could be characterised as similar to a blood alcohol level of between 0.02 and 0.05 per cent. Medicinal cannabis has been used to treat problems including chronic pain, chemotherapy-induced nausea and multiple sclerosis. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has approved more than 100,000 applications for patient access as of March 2021 and recently announced some medicinal cannabis products would be downgraded, meaning they can be sold over the counter in pharmacies. But patients prescribed these treatments have been fined and taken to court after taking the drug as directed by their doctor. Justin Sinclair, from the medicinal cannabis company Australian Natural Therapeutics Group, says regulatory risk is putting off people in regional Australia who may benefit from the drug but rely on their cars. ""I think there certainly needs to be some regulatory clarity,"" he told AAP. He wants an exemption from drug driving laws for people who have been prescribed medicinal cannabis, similar to that available for people on prescription methadone. TGA figures show medicinal cannabis has mostly been prescribed to women over 50. Previous research has found older drivers with physical ailments have a lower crash risk. Victoria is considering legislation to allow people to drive with chemicals from medicinal cannabis in their system as long as driving is not impaired - but the reforms would not cover people using illicit cannabis.

This trial is aimed at providing sufficient evidence to impact legislation in favour of permitting patients taking medical cannabis products to drive. Individuals taking medical cannabis products are currently not permitted to drive as roadside testing is unable to differentiate between legal and illegal use. Additionally, the trial will provide safety data required for the European Medicines Agency and Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration product registration. The trial is being carried out in conjunction with the Swinburne University of Technology and Australian medical cannabis distributor Cannvalate. Recruitment of 30 test individuals will begin in the fourth quarter of this year once all import/export permits that the company is seeking are granted. MGC’s product is a 20:1 cannabidiol to tetrahydrocannabinol compound formula that is authorised for prescription as an Investigational Medicinal Product in both Australia and the UK.

MGC said on Monday that the facility located in Slovenia and fitted out with state-of-the-art equipment to extract cannabinoid was on schedule for completion in Q2. Company management said that once completed, the major commercial and operational milestone would produce up to 3,000kg per year of cannabinoid in resin form.  This cannabis product will be used to supply clinical trials currently being undertaken by MGC into medicinal marijuana uses and is being sourced from the company's recently scaled-up marijuana growing operation, also based in Slovenia. MGC's first marijuana crop is due to be harvested in August this year. The company has been ramping up its Slovenian operations this year, cementing itself as a unique player in the global cannabis market. They have a research program into medicinal uses for marijuana in addition to their cannabis-based cosmetic and dermatological lines targeted at the booming worldwide demand for cannabis-derived products. MGC co-founder and managing director Nativ Segev said: ""The global demand for pharmaceutical grade Cannabinoids extract is strong and this presents a significant commercial opportunity for MGC Pharmaceuticals alongside our clinical trials.” ""There are few fully compliant GMP extraction facilities throughout Europe and we are pleased that our facility brings such a strong competitive advantage for our company."" Earlier this month, MGC recruited two leading epilepsy experts to conduct a new clinical trial looking at the efficacy of a cannabis based formulation to treat children and adolescents suffering from severe epilepsy. In another move aimed at bolstering its medicinal cannabis program, MGC recently completed the acquisition of Czech-based medical cannabis company Panax Pharma and can now access world-leading European facilities at the Czech Republic’s Institute of Experimental Botany of Academy of Sciences (IEBAS).

Her mother Kirsten said Saba, 9, started taking the prescription medicine this week and early signs were encouraging. Mrs Button said that it had been relatively straightforward getting a doctor to prescribe it because Saba’s neurologist had been treating her since she was a baby. Medical cannabis was recently approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Saba suffered extensive brain and organ damage after she had the Fluvax shot in 2010 when she was 11 months old. She was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy from an acquired brain injury, spastic quadriplegia, epilepsy and respiratory weakness. Her parents received a multimillion-dollar payout from the State Government and CSL which made Fluvax at the time. The vaccine is no longer approved for use in young children. The family set up the charity Saba Rose Button Foundation, which helps fund rehabilitation such as physiotherapy and equipment for special needs children. Mrs Button said they hoped medical cannabis would help reduce Saba’s 10 to 15 short seizures a day and cut her use of sedatives. “The benefits are that we will be able to move away from using the more sedating anticonvulsants, which is particularly important when you’re working really hard on her rehabilitation,” she said. “When they are alert and there is more communication, that’s when growth and development can occur in the brain. “The way we look at it, the medicinal cannabis doesn’t have the THC which is the psychoactive component and can’t do any harm, and might have some real benefits.” Sign up for our emails Find out More © West Australian Newspapers Limited 2023","Jun 22, 2018 ...

The company is also expecting to secure its own medicinal cannabis license in Australia within just months. The company has secured funding of up to $7m from New York financier Magna to drive near-term expansion and development of its algae and medicinal cannabis operations. Under the convertible note facility, $1m will be available immediately and another $1m will be made available upon shareholder approval with the remaining funds to be unlocked upon completion of key milestones. Algae.Tec Managing Director Malcolm James said: “With this funding now in place, we turn our focus to the full-scale commercialisation of both our algae and medicinal cannabis operating divisions and we look forward to providing our shareholders with further updates on these strategic initiatives shortly, as we enter this transformative period for the business.” The company is also finalising the proposed spin-off of its Uruguay medicinal cannabis interests as a wholly-owned subsidiary listed on either the ASX or possibly even another more appropriate stock exchange. This will provide a new home for the company’s 20% stake in Ma Genetics, and its 100% interest in the Auberna Uruguay medicinal cannabis collaboration venture with Auberna that will have its own cannabis license. The newly listed company will also own a 25% direct stake in Auberna who already have a license in Uruguay to grow and sell medicinal cannabis. Algae.Tech’s interest in a potential Zambian Cannabis licence and licensed operations in Fiji, PNG and China will also end up in the newly listed company whilst its Australian medicinal cannabis play will remain in-house. According to the company, strong interest has already been received from institutional investors for a planned $10 million capital raising that will be the centrepiece of the spin-off. Additionally, management is currently finalising plans and necessary arrangements for the development of a 4,000m2 to 8,000m2 controlled environment facility in Uruguay in partnership with Auberna. This will have attached harvesting and extraction capabilities to produce medicinal cannabis products for export to the North and South American markets. In November last year, Algae.Tec reached an agreement to acquire a 25% direct interest in Auberna through a further US$1m investment above the previous US$1.5m under their existing collaboration agreement. Auberna subsequently entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with Ma Genetics, giving it the right to access live plants and seeds to further the growing, licensing and research and development of medicinal cannabis. Separately, the company will carry out a Feasibility Study with Canadian-based extraction firm Radient Technologies for the proposed development of a large-scale commercial algae plant in North America. The plant will have a capacity of more than 300 tonnes per annum and be focussed on production for the nutraceutical and health food markets. Last month, Algae.Tec partnered with Radient to use the Edmonton-headquartered company’s extraction technology to boost the yield and consistency of its plant-based nutraceuticals, which are currently in development. The technology has previously proved effective at extracting the active ingredients from plants, including algae, in a cost-efficient manner. Once considered a noxious substance, algae is now believed to have many benefits flowing from its mix of essential amino acids, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins and minerals. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the company sees considerable potential for its algae-based offering in the nutraceutical market, which is estimated to be worth a staggering $200bn per year.

According to the company, these products retail for between US$30,000 and US$40,000 per kg and the company is working with a range of wholesalers to arrange supply agreements for them. Cannabidiol is the major non-psychoactive component of Cannabis and has a number of reported health benefits including its potential to act as an anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, antioxidant, antiemetic, anxiolytic and antipsychotic agent. The medical cannabis market is now busy developing cannabidiol as a potential medicine for the treatment of neuroinflammation, epilepsy, oxidative injury, vomiting, nausea, anxiety and schizophrenia. Algae.Tec has a 25% interest in Auberna and a joint venture collaboration arrangement in Uruguay that the partners are seeking to list publicly. In addition to its stake in Auberna, the new listing will also house the company’s 20% stake in Ma Genetics and its interest in the Auberna Uruguay medicinal cannabis collaboration venture with Auberna. According to the company, strong interest has already been received from institutional investors for a planned $10 million capital raising that will be the centrepiece of the spin-off. With Auberna being just one of two companies licensed to produce cannabis in Uruguay, there is potential for Algae.Tec and the soon to be listed company to take a commanding lead in the rapidly developing South American medical cannabis market.  While Uruguay was the first country to legalise the sale of marijuana in 2013, it is still struggling to meet the legal demand for product. An estimated 147,000 Uruguayans between the ages of 18 and 65 consume marijuana, with about a third of them using it weekly. Of these, only about 35,000 have registered to use the legal marijuana system, which allows them to buy as much as 40 grams of marijuana a month at participating pharmacies. The two licensed companies have only recently started meeting their combined 4 metric ton limit while licensed individual growers and user clubs produce up to 5 tons in total.

The term sheet is also subject to extensive market research conducted by IMC indicating the marketability of the product in the Territory and both parties entering into a formal agreement within 30 days of completion of the due diligence, according to management.

https://thewest.com.au/business/public-companies/mgc-pharma-signs-rmit-landmark-cannabis-research-deal-ng-b88463661z,MGC Pharma signs RMIT landmark cannabis research deal,"Saturday, 8 April 2023","Leading Australian medical marijuana company MGC Pharmaceuticals has announced it is partnering with the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, often referred to as “RMIT”, on a suite of research initiatives related to medicinal cannabis. MGC told the market on Tuesday that it had signed a binding Memorandum of Understanding with RMIT establishing a research partnership that would initially focus on cannabis genetics and cultivation to treat a range of diseases, including cancer. The strategic partnership between MGC and RMIT, one of the country’s most revered University based scientific research institutions, will include setting up a world first “International Library of Cannabis Medicine” detailing the genetic make-up of a wide variety of cannabis strains, MGC said. The proposed umbrella agreement will also aim to develop a genetics and breeding program for establishing medical cannabis strains and greenlights collaboration on medical grade cannabis products for future clinical studies in Australia, management said. MGC Managing Director Nativ Segev said: “This is a substantial and landmark research agreement in the emerging medicinal cannabis space. We look forward to working with RMIT University, a world-class research institute with cutting-edge facilities and exceptional scientific staff.  “This research initiative also presents a significant long-term commercial opportunity for the Company, as the research could guide the development of future proprietary medical grade cannabis products.” MGC sees the deal as something of a coup given it is likely to strengthen its position in the expanding Australian cannabis market, with the Perth listed company now set to apply for an Australian Medical Cannabis Licence for cultivation and research at RMIT’s facilities. The announcement comes just a day after MGC revealed it had boosted its presence in Europe, securing new wholesalers for its cannabidiol-based cosmetics and skin care products for retail outlets in Spain, Italy and Romania. The RMIT deal marks another positive step for MGC’s ambitious journey into the booming global market for cannabis-based products after the company recently easily raised $10 million to pursue its growth objectives.
