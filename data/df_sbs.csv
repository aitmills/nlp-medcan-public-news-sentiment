The amendments will create two licence classes (medicine and research), limit access only to “fit and proper” Australians with no ties to crime, and allow the importation of plants and seed. This is an important milestone intended to (re)introduce lawful medicinal cannabis in Australia, after it was prohibited some 50 years ago. Almost two-thirds of the community have supported medicinal cannabis for many years. Several further steps are required before people with distressing symptoms from conditions for which conventional medicines have been ineffective can obtain some relief from medicinal cannabis. These conditions include cancer, epilepsy and multiple sclerosis. The House of Representatives and Senate are expected to approve the proposed amendments. Almost two-thirds of the community have supported medicinal cannabis for many years. The government seems, sensibly, to prefer a single national system for medicinal cannabis rather than see eight different state and territory systems. There has been considerable negotiation between the Commonwealth, states and territories to this end. More will be needed. For elderly people from rural areas dying of cancer, these are very significant penalties. (AAP) Source: AAP First, as there is no current law allowing medicinal use of cannabis in Australia, some legal changes are needed. Under Commonwealth law, cannabis is now in Schedule 9 of the Poisons Standard, the most restricted category. This means cannabis cannot legally be used for medicinal purposes including being prescribed by a doctor. The Commonwealth government is consulting on shifting cannabis from Schedule 9 (Prohibited Substance) to Schedule 8 (Controlled Drugs) to enable the drug to then be prescribed by doctors for patients. This may also require the states and territories to undertake some similar changes. The government is also ensuring the provision of medicinal cannabis will not breach Australia’s international drug treaty obligations. Second, decisions are needed about how medicinal cannabis will have to be stored. Restricting medicinal cannabis only to hospital pharmacies will severely limit utilisation of the drug. But there is still some resistance to community pharmacies being allowed to store it. Unless lawful medicinal cannabis is made reasonably accessible, including in community pharmacies, current strong demand will continue to be met largely by an unregulated black market. For elderly people from rural areas dying of cancer, these are very significant penalties. Third, decisions will have to be made about the sorts of patients allowed to be prescribed medicinal cannabis, about the doctors allowed to prescribe the drug, whether any training would be required before doctors are approved and what formulations of medicinal cannabis will be allowed. Some are confident all of these matters will be resolved before the end of the year, enabling a system of routine care involving medicinal cannabis to commence operating in 2016. But this will require action from the Commonwealth to engage with GPs and pharmacists through their professional bodies to identify and resolve outstanding issues with the supply chain at the point where it should be delivering to patients. Several research projects involving medicinal cannabis in NSW, Queensland and Victoria will commence soon. 




NSW signs up for  cannabis trials
The NSW government is pushing ahead with plans to trial cannabis-based medicines in children with epilepsy.  

 One of the unresolved problems is the eight state/territory drug driving laws. These enable police to perform roadside testing of oral fluid for THC (cannabis), methamphetamine and MDMA. No proof of driving impairment is required to support a conviction by the courts. Penalties for convicted drivers in some jurisdictions are quite severe involving a fine of over A$1,000 and a driving license disqualification of six months. At present, there are no plans to amend the drug driving laws for people lawfully taking medicinal cannabis under medical direction. For elderly people from rural areas dying of cancer, these are very significant penalties. Ley said the legislation tabled did not relate to the decriminalisation of cannabis for general cultivation or recreational use adding: if states wish to decriminalise cannabis, then that’s entirely a matter for them. This is a very significant statement for several reasons. First, it recognises the reality that in many of the countries that have allowed medicinal cannabis, a debate has soon developed about regulating the recreational use of the drug with growing community support soon forcing politicians to allow regulation. Second, it seems to accept that while the decision to start allowing medicinal cannabis is separate from any decisions regarding the prohibition of recreational use, how lawful medicinal cannabis is provided cannot be considered without also taking into account the recreational use of the drug. The more restricted the availability of medicinal cannabis, the more patients will utilise unregulated black market supplies and vice versa. The good news is that the process of providing legislative and policy framework for lawful medicinal cannabis in Australia has at long last started. But we still do not know when and how that framework will operate.   Alex Wodak, Emeritus Consultant, St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst This article was originally published on The Conversation.

Our Elle Macpherson has her own lingerie line. Britney Spears has a series of fragrances. Even Russell Crowe has delved into the lucrative world of running eateries and football teams alike. But actress and talk show host, Whoopi Goldberg, has taken the celeb business model to new heights by launching her very own line of medicinal marijuana products. The new line of lotions, bath soaks, edible treats, and therapeutic oils, produced alongside edible food maker, Maya Elisabeth, has been specifically designed for women to reduce cramps and period pain.   Whoopi Goldberg has launched a line of pot-infused products to help women with period pain. (Touchstone Pictures) Source: Touchstone Pictures Goldberg, who is determined to have her products to be taken seriously, says she is not interested in providing a platform for recreational cannabis use.  Her health line is for medicinal usage alone, she emphasises. “I want to go nice and slow with this. I don’t want this to be a joke to people. It’s not a joke to women,” Goldberg told USA Today. Beyond regular monthly discomfort, cramps can be symptomatic of serious medical conditions like dysmenorrhea or endometriosis, meaning Goldberg's could provide more effective relief for these women than simple painkillers.  Even Queen Victoria used marijuana to alleviate her period pain. (Creative Commons) Source: Wiki Commons Medicinal Cannibis Australia tells SBS Life cannabis can be successfully used to treat period pain, and has been used to do so throughout history. ""It is in our opinion that medicinal cannabis can assist with the pain associated with menstrual cramps. This can be taken orally in food/oils, or the dried plant can be vaporised. ""This has been done throughout history. Queen Victoria even spoke about the relief that cannabis gave her for her menstrual cramps,"" says the organisation. Period pain is an important issue for women. Even the UK has recently entertained the idea of a monthly period leave, allowing women to rest for a day or two whilst suffering from cramps and bloating. As passionate as she is about her products, Goldberg says getting her cannabis line off the ground was not easy.  This is what Whoopi Goldberg's new weed-infused products look like. (Whoopi & Maya) Source: Whoopi & Maya “They always came back with: ‘That’s too niche a market,’” she told Glamour. “It’s like, half of the planet is not a niche market! Most guys don’t have any idea what a period is or how it works. It’s like, ‘There’s a vagina, and there’s an egg ...’” Goldberg's business partner, Maya Elisabeth, with whom she forms the company called Whoopi & Maya, also shared her views with the magazine, saying their products, though strong enough to be effective, was perfect for first time users. “This is a great introductory line to first-time cannabis users because two of the items are topicals, which don’t get you high,” Elisabeth said. “And one product, the cocoa, can be made only with CBD (cannabidiol), which is a very subtle but powerful mood elevator that helps with anxiety and depression, and is an anti-inflammatory.” For now, these health products are only available in California, and to those with medical marijuana cards. Cannabis is illegal at the federal level in the US.

https://www.sbs.com.au/topics/voices/health/article/2018/03/29/we-were-desperate-family-turns-black-market-medical-cannabis,‘We were desperate’: Family turns to black market for medical cannabis                                  ,,"Alice* watched her four-year-old son Rhys* be loaded onto an air ambulance bound for Sydney, and thought, this can’t go on. It had been the second time in two months that Rhys had been airlifted from his home in Canberra to Sydney for a five-day stay. The month prior, his condition was so bad that Alice and her family had thought they’d lost him. Rhys was born with a chromosome disorder, which means he needs a wheelchair and cannot walk, talk, feed himself nor dress himself. On top of this, he was suffering regular unexplained pain episodes which saw his body stiffen for hours on end.  Rhys had to be flown to hospital when his condition would worsen. Source: Supplied “We were desperate,” Alice says. “There was nothing we could give him apart from opiates to control the pain, but opiates meant [hospital staff] would have to take over his breathing.” She started researching alternative pain relief methods and quickly zoned in on medical cannabis. Via personal networks, she found an Australian-based distributor, and contacted them to purchase a supply, despite not having a prescription.  She started giving Rhys regular doses: starting with one drop morning and evening, and rising to three drops each time. And almost instantaneously, things turned around. “It’s made a huge difference. He’s put on weight, he sleeps better and he hasn’t been in the hospital with pain related issues since we started it,” she says. Alice is one of a growing number of parents giving their children cannabis oil to help mitigate the effects of chronic illnesses. But they do so knowing there is a risk: uneven legislation across states governing the prescription and use of medical cannabis means that some risk fines, even jail, for obtaining, growing or supplying the drug. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners is one group working hard to ensure the legislation is standardised. ""It’s almost impossible to jump through all these hoops and prescribe cannabis in a timely and reasonable fashion.” “If we look at the scientific evidence, there’s now conclusive and substantive evidence that [medicinal cannabis] is effective in patients with severe and disabling pain,” says Dr Bastian Seidel of the college.  “There’s no nationally consistent regulatory framework covering cannabis. It’s very confusing if you’re a medical practitioner and you feel you’ve exhausted all other avenues to treat a patient, it’s almost impossible to jump through all these hoops and prescribe cannabis in a timely and reasonable fashion.” Marijuana has been decriminalised for medicinal use across the country, yet different states have different laws, and it remains difficult to source.  Marijuana has 113 active chemical components, and when it is processed for medical use, the main psychoactive component THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol) is removed, meaning you can’t get high. It is CBD (cannabidiol) that users want to help treat medical conditions such as multiple sclerosis, epilepsy or pain.  ""It’s had such a positive impact on Rhys and our whole family that I don’t want to lose it."" Still, companies supplying the oil in Australia can face legal action or being shut down. This is precisely what happened to the organisation that initially supplied Alice. After it shut down she looked elsewhere, and now obtains the oil from a company in the Netherlands which sends her packages through the mail. “We’ve had no problems, none of our packages have been held up at Customs, but we know the legalities around it are grey,” she says. According to Alice, the oil doesn’t contain THC and has all ingredients properly listed, however even after looking at the TGA’s website she can’t work out whether it’s legal or not.  The European supply has added benefits: it has a purer taste, meaning Rhys can swallow it comfortably, and it is also thoroughly batch tested, with results available to view online. “It’s had such a positive impact on Rhys and our whole family that I don’t want to lose it,” says Alice. “I’d gotten to the point where I felt like I wasn’t coping. Life was so unpredictable and ending up in hospital for days would really disrupt our lives. I have other children who still need to be picked up from school, I have work deadlines to meet. My other children’s behaviour was starting to deteriorate. Now, they’ve settled a lot. It’s made a huge difference, everybody’s less stressed and I feel we can manage a bit better.”  Alice wants proper regulation so she can be assured of consistent supply and the knowledge she isn’t breaking any laws. “If a medical professional feels it’s appropriate to prescribe medicinal cannabis then they should be able to."" Dr Seidel says obtaining medicines on the black market limits the capacity of the medical profession to monitor how patients respond. “In 2018 it’s completely unacceptable to have to get drugs on the black market,” says Dr Seidel. “If a medical professional feels it’s appropriate to prescribe medicinal cannabis then they should be able to. If it’s being accessed on the black market we don’t know what’s being put in, we don’t know the dose being given, and this isn’t in the interests of the patient, of parents, or of society.” *Names have been changed.

Last year, the Victorian state government made moves to legalise its use by people with serious medical issues, including severe epilepsy, cancer, multiple sclerosis and HIV/AIDS. Other states are following in Victoria’s steps to legalise and provide the highly effective pain relief to those who need it most. In Victoria, marijuana is being grown at a secret location and will be produced in eyedropper, oil, capsule, vapour and spray form. But not in a form that would allow it to be smoked. The public perception of someone who uses marijuana oil and a joint smoker could not be more different - cannabis oil has been marketed as a natural and powerful painkiller, often for very sick and vulnerable children. Smoking weed, on the other hand, is considered to be something purely recreational and illegal - ‘stoners’, droopy eyed with the munchies. “Victoria Police (would also not support smoking cannabis being legalised) because the medicinal product could be confused with the illegal product.” It’s not just the public image of smoking weed that’s prevented it from being legalised for medical use; there are genuine reasons for this, says Nick Gadd, from the Victorian Law Reform Commission. “Smoking has adverse health effects and is an unreliable way of dosing; the Cancer Council Victoria among others would not support such a scheme,” he says. Mr Gadd says governments have also run successive health campaigns against smoking tobacco, so it would be contradictory to allow the smoking of medical marijuana. “Victoria Police (would also not support smoking cannabis being legalised) because the medicinal product could be confused with the illegal product,” he says. 




Weed advocate Woody Harrelson quits marijuana due to incorrect use
The 'True Detective' star has broken his silence on the trappings of a cannabis-centric life. 

  Medical cannabis is a strong painkiller for people with severe medical conditions and for many, it is the only effective way of controlling, not only excruciating pain and nausea, but violent spasms and seizures. Despite its effectiveness, patients and their carers have struggled for years to be able to access it legally. Geoff Munro, national policy manager with Alcohol and Drug Foundation, says legalising medical cannabis has been a complex process, in part because of its illegal recreational use and the image that comes with it. Keeping the ban on smoking marijuana will help separate its distinctive uses - recreational and medical - and maintain community support.  ""When medical cannabis is available...in some people’s eyes, it will give it a more positive image,” he says. Keeping that distinction, Mr Munro says, is really important for the integrity of its medical use. ""When medical cannabis is available...in some people’s eyes, it will give it a more positive image.” The way that medical cannabis actually works on the body isn’t entirely understood. However, scientists do know that marijuana is a complex plant that’s made up of more than 60 compounds. Of those, two compounds - THC and CBD - have the biggest impact on users. CBD is the ‘good’ compound, which provides the pain relief and lessons the severity of seizures and spasms, while THC is responsible for the ‘high’ that recreational users seek. Apart from the direct benefit that people suffering from unspeakable pain and seizures will receive from using medical cannabis, there will be other gains of legalising medical cannabis for producers and researchers.  Mr Munro says currently, the ‘illegal’ supply of medical cannabis is almost all synthetic. This is why the Victorian Government has allowed for the cultivation of a crops – which could in turn provide a financial windfall to people with licences to grow pharmaceutical grade cannabis. The other upside, he adds, is that despite the fact that medical cannabis provides so many positive benefits, as scientists have never been able to find out why, because of the law. This will finally allow this medical mystery to be resolved and could pave the way for further treatments. “When medical cannabis is a pharmaceutical product, they have to be suitably tested and the ingredients have the known exactly, and that’s the value we’re going to learn about.”   The documentary, 'The Truth About Medical Marijuana' , exposes audiences to living examples of the benefits of medical marijuana, while exploring the forces that seek to keep the treatments at bay.  The Truth About Medical Marijuana airs on Sunday 9 April at 8:30pm on SBS and is available on SBS On Demand after broadcast.

We didn’t know it at the time, but the unbearable, agonising pain she was experiencing in the months before her death was due to an acute form of leukaemia that was hard to detect. Traditional pain management wasn’t particularly effective, so Mum was forced to endure the suffering. I was quite shielded from witnessing much of her pain at its most severe. I was 17 at the time, but Mum being Mum didn’t want her kids to see her that way if she could help it. I’m sure that was as much about protecting us as it was herself. There’s a relentless indignity in acute suffering. No one wants to suffer in front of an audience. But I could hear her cries of pain. Those cries and the suffering I did see will remain with me for the rest of my life.   Happier times: my mum, Gillian, and me in 1980. Source: Jim Mitchell Looking back, I wonder if medical marijuana might have helped my mum better manage the pain of this unknown disease that was ravaging her body. I don’t know if it was ever raised with her as an option. Certainly at the time, the issue wasn’t prominent on the national agenda like it is now. Most of all, I wish my mum had been afforded the choice - the legal choice to use it as a treatment if that was her wish. Helen Kapalos’s documentary A Life of its Own: The Truth about Medical Marijuana offers a poignant insight into the unfathomable suffering those with debilitating illnesses endure and investigates the stunning therapeutic benefits of medical cannabis.  Left: Dan Haslam without medical marijuana to help manage his sickness from chemotherapy. Right: By smoking medical marijuana, Dan’s sickness subsided. Source: SBS It remains a much stigmatised and misunderstood treatment. There’s a misconception it’s the same illicit drug as recreational marijuana. Recreational marijuana’s high derives from the compound Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Medical marijuana has a much higher concentration of the therapeutic compound Cannabidiol (CBD) and a much lower concentration of THC. Unlike THC, CBD is generally thought to be non-psychoactive. Put simply, medicinal marijuana’s purpose is not to make people high, it’s therapeutic. Complicating access is that the scope of legality or lack of it differs between states and territories. Legal access is incredibly limited, so people have been forced to break the law to source treatments from the unregulated black market or by growing their own cannabis. People can feel like criminals for sourcing what is, for some, their only form of effective treatment. There’s an infuriating irony here. Conventional opioids that can have serious side effects are a legal treatment for the management of chronic suffering. Meanwhile medical marijuana with its proven benefits - and, according to many users, no reported side effects - is not readily available in Australia, stuck as it is in a legal and bureaucratic minefield.  Left: Deisha Stevens, who suffers from a severe form of epilepsy, without cannabis oil. Right: Deisha becomes a changed girl with cannabis oil treatment. Source: SBS How can we allow people to endure the barbarity of their suffering? There’s a desperate need for widespread, legal access that is currently limited - for example, to select patients participating in strictly controlled trials. For patients and their families, there’s growing frustration at how slow the process towards legalisation is in this country. Progress is happening in Australia, but it’s a mixed blessing. The federal government announced recently that importation of medicinal cannabis treatments would be made easier, but only those with a doctor’s prescription can access them. The government is also promising a faster approval process for licences to grow and harvest medical cannabis domestically. There’s also a key stumbling block in the contentious issue of research within the medical community. Some believe there’s overwhelming evidence to legalise medicinal cannabis; others say that more definitive research needs to be done before safe, legal treatment can be prescribed.  Head grower Roy Reshef at a licensed cannabis farm in Israel. Israel is leading the way in medical cannabis research. Source: SBS What’s heartening is the groundswell of advocacy and support for legalisation that has made the issue a key rung on the national and media agenda. That’s due in large part to the tireless advocacy of Lucy and Lou Haslam, a former policeman who has led drug squads. Their late son, Dan, was a tireless advocate. He had benefited greatly from medical cannabis to treat debilitating sickness from chemotherapy for his bowel cancer. A bill has been introduced into federal parliament to legalise medicinal cannabis in Australia - it's named ""Dan’s Law"" in his honour. When it comes down to it, only those who are battling these severe traumas to the body and mind can know how that feels. And only those who also suffer as they watch their loved ones in debilitating pain can know the sheer desperation of wanting something, anything to take it away.  Tireless advocates for the legalisation and awareness of medicinal marijuana - Dan Haslam and mum Lucy. Source: SBS Imagine the suffering that could have been prevented if medical marijuana was already a legitimate treatment like opioids? If we take the red tape out of the equation - and it’s a mighty barrier - the right to legally use medical marijuana for those in desperate need becomes an issue of compassion and empathy. We can’t stop people being dealt a bad hand, but we can help them manage it. If medical marijuana can be beneficial to those in pain – and we know it can – then blanket legalisation needs to happen as soon as possible in Australia. When people are suffering needlessly, it should be a human right.    Watch A Life of its Own: The Truth about Medical Marijuana on SBS On Demand right here:  More on the Guide
