The $92 million export agreement marks the start of a trade partnership with the region, which is forecast to become the world's largest legal market. Health Minister Greg Hunt says Australia is poised to become a recognised leader in the global supply of the highest quality medicinal cannabis products. Looking for a new job or job candidate? Post jobs and search for local talent on 7NEWS Jobs >> ""Australia's gold-standard regulation of medicinal cannabis products, coupled with a premium agricultural and manufacturing industry, means we are well positioned to become a preferred supplier,"" Mr Hunt said on Thursday. ""This has the potential to create jobs and boost economic growth in Australia as we look to new and different export channels."" The 10-year deal will initially see about two tonnes of locally grown and dried cannabis flowers shipped over the next 18 months. ""This is a major win for the industry in Australia,"" Australian Natural Therapeutics Group chief executive Matt Cantelo said. ""While the German cannabis industry is still in its infancy, it is (already) the third-largest market globally behind the US and Canada"". ANTG are the first local growers to crack the EU market, which currently receives the majority of imported products from Canada and The Netherlands. ""Now that we have the gold standard in growing and manufacturing medicinal cannabis - in line with the most stringent in the world - it means our product also qualifies for export to every other nation,"" Mr Cantelo said. The market for medicinal cannabis in Germany is expected to grow rapidly in the next decade and reach $12.4 billion by 2028, according to ANTG. Mr Cantelo said Australia's tough regulatory framework had set the local industry up as the best in the world. ""Australia also has the reputation and climate for growing excellent produce in general - it makes sense that we would produce the highest quality, non-irradiated medicinal cannabis product as well,"" he said. Federal parliament in June passed legislation authorising the export of medicinal cannabis and hemp into more overseas markets. It gives farmers access to export opportunities in Southeast Asia, China, Canada and the lucrative US market, along with Europe. The new laws also mean Australia will be able to certify legitimate exports of narcotic products, helping producers export to countries and regions that need government approval, such as the European Union, which holds the strictest regulations on imports.

Researchers at Western Sydney University surveyed women with endometriosis in New Zealand and Australia, where 72 per cent of respondents reported self-administering cannabis illicitly. The women self-reported positive outcomes in using cannabis to manage the often painful condition, in which tissue similar to that which lines the uterus grows beyond it causing inflammation and scarring. For more Health & Wellbeing related news and videos check out Health & Wellbeing >> It is estimated that one in nine Australian women has endometriosis. Just 23 per cent of the 186 Australian respondents accessed cannabis through a doctor’s prescription, the study, published in the Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research journal, found. Medicinal cannabis was approved for use in Australia in 2016. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has said the majority of patients who seek medicinal cannabis do so for pain management but that the evidence for many painful conditions is still limited. The administration does not consider medical cannabis a “first-line therapy” for any illness, meaning other treatments should be considered first. Chief Scientific Officer with the Australian Natural Therapeutics Group and lead author Justin Sinclair said there was still stigma around medical cannabis and he was concerned people were using cannabis without medical supervision. “A number of factors, including concern surrounding possible legal repercussions, judgement from either their doctor or society, or their doctors’ presumed unwillingness to prescribe legal medicinal cannabis were the main reasons for not talking to their doctor,” Mr Sinclair said. “Improving doctor and patient communication about medicinal cannabis use may improve levels of medical oversight, the preference for legal medicinal cannabis adoption over acquisition via illicit supply and reducing cannabis-associated stigma.” Mr Sinclair said “on a positive note” almost all Australian respondents said they would continue to use cannabis as it provided better pain relief than current treatments.

Heavy knocks are causing injuries that leave players suffering from a lifetime of crippling chronic pain. But world-leading clinical trials in Perth and Melbourne have found daily doses of medicinal cannabis can provide relief to those whose pain is so severe they rely on large doses of drugs like morphine to get through the day.

Stream them all for free on 7plus  >> Find out more in the video above Years of rough play has taken its toll for ex-WAFL and VFL player Ryan Gale. “I don’t think I ever went one week without pain somewhere,” he told 7NEWS. Like so many sports players, Ryan had pushed through the pain, hiding it from club doctors. “Physios say, ‘are you alright?’,” Ryan said. “(You say) yes you are alright, give me an injection and get me back on the field.” It was a mindset that led to years of chronic pain. ""‘(You say) yes you are alright, give me an injection and get me back on the field.’"" But at just 33, he ended up needing a hip replacement. Countless retired sportspeople have the same problems. But Richard Hopkins, the managing director of Zelira Therapeutics, which is conducting a medicinal cannabis trial for retired athletes, says the sporting pain and injury is a “silent epidemic” not being talked about often enough. Early results of the Zelira Therapeutics trial, being carried out at St Vincent’s Hospital in Melbourne and Emerald Clinics in Perth, have shown medicinal cannabis can safely provide relief to patients who would otherwise be relying on opioid-based medications such as morphine. “Not only did we find that our cannabinoid formulation is safe for them to use and did not result in any serious side-effects, but we have also seen promising positive effects on their physical and mental wellbeing,” Dr Hopkins said. Seven patients who used at least 60mgs of morphine or equivalent medication daily to treat chronic pain took part in Phase 1 of the study. Patients were given a single dose of a medicinal cannabis formulation on the first day, followed by two doses daily for a further six days. A questionnaire filled out by trial patients showed a “significant improvement” in pain interference scores, which measures how pain impacts a person’s function and daily life. It doesn’t work for everyone and more research is needed, but for Ryan Gale, it’s been a game-changer. “It’s so much better than taking some of the other stuff,” he told 7NEWS. ""‘It’s so much better than taking some of the other stuff.’"" Dr Hopkins said the adverse side-effects of opioid-based treatment, including physical dependence, meant alternatives needed to be found. “In the United States, an estimated 49,000 people died from opioid overdose in 2017 and that’s why it’s so important that we find alternative medications to treat chronic pain,” he said.

But cannabis oil could help change this, with a clinical trial in Perth already revealing positive results. Medicinal cannabis has been shown to relieve pain and has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that can influence mood, memory, sleep and appetite. Watch the latest news and stream for free on 7plus  >> The treatment option is legal in Australia, but is highly regulated and getting your hands on it can be a challenge. Its potential to relieve medical conditions is being researched worldwide, but the lack of concrete evidence has some doctors hesitant to prescribe the drug. For Melbourne mother Kerri Honey, cannabis oil has dramatically improved her family’s life. Her eight-year-old daughter Phoenix lives with autism and started using medicinal cannabis around five months ago. “She takes about 12 tablets a day - she’s on a lot, and for me I don’t see the effect that it should be having,” she said. Despite taking several different medications, taking care of Phoenix is still “full on”. “We physically can’t take her out unless we have a support worker,” Mrs Honey said. “Her meltdowns are really aggressive ... she goes from very calm to very aggressive in a split second. “Her meds are supposed to stabilise that, but we don’t see that.” Mrs Honey says her husband was initially hesitant about trying medicinal cannabis, but once they got a prescription they quickly noticed significant results. “She was fully medicated on the day we went to the clinic and the doctor asked ‘is she medicated?’ because she was bouncing off the walls,” she said. The medicinal cannabis combined with her medications and a new sleep probiotic helped make Phoenix easier to manage. “We’ve noticed a change with it all together, she seems a lot calmer,” Mrs Honey said. “We need to have them all in play for it to have a difference for her.” The mother-of-five says people need to understand that family situations like hers are not easy. “I was one of those judgmental mums in the street saying keep control of your kid before Phoenix was diagnosed,” she said. “Now on the other side, I think there needs to be more education and support if a parent chooses to medicate in general.” A clinical trial in Western Australia is exploring how low dose medicinal cannabis oils can treat autism associated behaviours in young people between six and 18 years old. The product, Hope 1, is welcome news for parents, who say finding a treatment that doesn’t have other side effects is challenging. Amour Stanes’ son Austin was diagnosed with autism at the age of eight. She says they tried every drug available, experiencing severe side effects. Six years later, Austin’s quality of life was showing no signs of improvement. “He was going to school less, because he just couldn’t handle being at school a whole day due to a myriad of issues, but mainly behavioural,” Ms Stanes told 7NEWS. That was when she took matters into her own hands, discovering the Hope 1 trial at the start of last year. “The effect that it’s having for him significantly outweighs the benefit of any medication that he has been on in the past,” she said. Emerald Clinics medical director Alistair Vickery says that while the results have been overwhelmingly positive in the early stage, the trial is not for everyone. “Of the patients we’ve recruited, three have dropped out because of side effects,” Dr Vickery said. “This isn’t a drug that doesn’t have side effects, and it’s not a drug that’s for everyone.” The side effects of cannabis are still being studied, but may include drowsiness, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, problems with memory and problems with balance. Since early 2021, the Therapeutic Goods Administration has allowed the sale of lose-dose cannabidiol (CBD) over the counter at pharmacies - but it could be a long wait before you find any at your local chemist. Currently no CBD products have been approved by the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, meaning the TGA can’t vouch for their safety, quality or efficacy. This means patients wanting to buy medicinal cannabis products legally will still require a prescription. Medical practitioners in all states can prescribe medicinal cannabis products for patients if they believe it is clinically appropriate and they have the required approvals. Prescribing for young people may require the support of a medical specialist and special approvals. While recreational cannabis remains illegal in most countries worldwide, various jurisdictions have legalised its medicinal use. The UK, Brazil, Colombia, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Poland and Switzerland are among those, while countries such as France and Ireland are currently trialling the treatment option. Affordability and accessibility are a big issue families face when considering medicinal cannabis, Mrs Honey says. Medicinal cannabis products are not currently subsidised by the federal government through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, meaning the full cost falls on the patient. The Victorian Government has a “compassionate access scheme” that funds the products for a limited number of children with severe epilepsy, but otherwise patients must front the cost. A study of medicinal cannabis use in Australia found 21 per cent of respondents were illicitly sourcing their medicine because legal cannabis was too expensive. Costs vary depending on each person’s condition and the product, but the average spend is around $10-$15 a day. “It’s very expensive,” Mrs Honey said. The family blows through around $500 each month for Phoenix’s 30mL bottle with 1500mg of CBD. When the prescription increases to a higher dose of 3000mg, it will double in price. “It puts a dent in the wallet,” Mrs Honey said. Many healthcare professionals are still hesitant to prescribe medicinal cannabis, but Dr Vickery says that is mainly because of a lack of knowledge. “It’s the fear of what people understand about recreational cannabis where people are essentially overdosing with THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol) to get high ... whereas we’re using very small doses ... and slowly getting up to a dose that is effective,” he said. Mrs Honey says she thinks medicinal cannabis should be more accessible for children with autism and other conditions, after her family faced an uphill to get a prescription. “The first pediatrician we saw blatantly shut me down when I suggested it,” she said. The doctor told the family there was not enough studies for them to feel comfortable prescribing it. “At our fourth appointment in, we were still not getting anywhere,” Mrs Honey said. “Nothing was stabilising, sleep was becoming a bigger issue where she wasn’t doing it and we couldn’t physical function during the day without her sleeping.” It was then they found relief in a clinic that provided them with a prescription at the first appointment. “There’s a huge call for it, so many kids these days are being diagnosed and the answer is to shove a pill down their throat,” Mrs Honey said. “What do the tablets do to their bodies in the long term? “I hope the government can decide to give this a bigger try ... it could help so many other people.” Researchers say there is a need to expand the evidence base supporting medicinal cannabis to help change public perceptions and make it more accessible. CBD oil is considered a promising candidate for supporting children with ASD, due to it being prescribed to help reduce seizures in childhood epilepsy. The drug may reduce severe behavioural problems in children and adults with an intellectual disability, according to a recent study by the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute. The pilot study, published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, involved eight participants, aged 8-16 years, who took either CBD or placebo over eight weeks. Most of the participants also had autism. It found a clinically significant change in the children’s irritability, aggression, self-injury, and yelling. The early findings are not enough to make definitive statements, but “strongly support” a larger follow-up trial, which has since been funded. A study from Israel observing 53 children with ASD taking CBD oil recorded improvements across several areas including sleep disturbances, hyperactivity, self-injury and anxiety. Another study out of Turkey concluded using lower doses of CBD and THC seemed promising in managing behavioural problems associated with autism and could be effective in managing the core symptoms. However, the TGA says there have been “very few” well-designed clinical trials using medicinal cannabis, so there is limited evidence available on its success in treating conditions and on effective forms and dosages. The authority cautioned patients about the “very limited evidence” about how medicinal cannabis reacts with other approved medications. “There is a significant need for larger, high-quality studies to explore the potential benefits, limitations and safety issues associated with medicinal cannabis treatment across a range of health conditions and symptoms,” it says. “If more studies support medicinal cannabis use and provide evidence for particular forms, dosages and administration methods, it is more likely that doctors will feel confident in prescribing medicinal cannabis over other approved options.” Watch the latest news on Channel 7 or stream it for free on 7plus >> Stream Big on By Darren Walton / Golf Sowaibah Hanifie / NSW News By George Clarke / Rugby League By Bianca Bongato / Housing Digital Staff / Entertainment Ailish Delaney / VIC News Ailish Delaney / VIC News Ailish Delaney / Queensland News By Darren Walton / Golf Sowaibah Hanifie / NSW News By George Clarke / Rugby League By Bianca Bongato / Housing Digital Staff / Entertainment Ailish Delaney / VIC News Ailish Delaney / VIC News Ailish Delaney / Queensland News","Mar 26, 2022 ...

""The risk is probably considerably less than with many medications such as antidepressants, opioids and benzodiazepines,"" Professor Iain McGregor from The Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics at the University of Sydney told AAP. His analysis, published in the International Journal of Drug Policy, shows other prescription drugs such as opioids and benzodiazepines can more than double the risk of crashing. For more Medicine related news and videos check out Medicine >> By contrast, previous studies have shown drivers testing positive for cannabis have a slightly increased crash risk (of 1.1 to 1.4), while other recent research has shown no increased risk at all. Prof McGregor said the scenario could be characterised as similar to a blood alcohol level of between 0.02 and 0.05 per cent. Medicinal cannabis has been used to treat problems including chronic pain, chemotherapy-induced nausea and multiple sclerosis. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has approved more than 100,000 applications for patient access as of March 2021 and recently announced some medicinal cannabis products would be downgraded, meaning they can be sold over the counter in pharmacies. But patients prescribed these treatments have been fined and taken to court after taking the drug as directed by their doctor. Justin Sinclair, from the medicinal cannabis company Australian Natural Therapeutics Group, says regulatory risk is putting off people in regional Australia who may benefit from the drug but rely on their cars. ""I think there certainly needs to be some regulatory clarity,"" he told AAP. He wants an exemption from drug driving laws for people who have been prescribed medicinal cannabis, similar to that available for people on prescription methadone. TGA figures show medicinal cannabis has mostly been prescribed to women over 50. Previous research has found older drivers with physical ailments have a lower crash risk. Victoria is considering legislation to allow people to drive with chemicals from medicinal cannabis in their system as long as driving is not impaired - but the reforms would not cover people using illicit cannabis.

This is it, almost done. Thanks for the love,"" she said. During sentencing submissions in October, her counsel, Greg Barns, said Hallam had lost $20,000 supplying cannabis as a treatment for chronic pain, epilepsy and ""a range of other serious ailments"". ""This is a case where you have an individual who is meeting ... a demand which seems to have arisen in the Australian community,"" he said.

Hallam's home at Hillier, in Adelaide's north, was raided by police in January 2017, but she was not charged with drug offences until three months later. She had intended to take the case to trial, arguing she acted out of medical necessity in the supply of cannabis oil to those who needed the drug to relieve pain, though in February this year she pleaded guilty to the charges. Prosecutor Nick Wong said Hallam's offending was serious enough to warrant jail time but he was not opposed to a suspended sentence.

""The closest a lot of people have got to these plants is watching them go up in smoke when the police obviously raid facilities and confiscate plants,"" said Marshall. Leaving nothing to chance, both local police and detectives from the NSW drug squad have been intimately involved with the project and know all the ins-and-outs to protect the factory from be targeted by criminals. This trial will go for several years. These plants to be used to produce other plants which will go to flower and be harvested for testing later this year.

The global market for medicinal cannabis therapeutics has a projected worth of $US44 billion ($A55 billion) by 2024. CSIRO Scientist, Adjunct Professor Peter Duggan, says the new licence places the national science agency at the forefront of research into the development of new cannabis medicines. For more Health & Wellbeing related news and videos check out Health & Wellbeing >> ""Around the world, researchers are exploring the potential for medicinal cannabis to help with conditions such as epilepsy and the nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy treatment, multiple sclerosis and chronic pain,"" he said in a statement on Thursday. ""We had been able to do early-stage work with cannabis but the new licence will enable us to develop cannabis-derived cannabinoid medicines using innovative extraction, refinement and formulation techniques."" The experienced botanical extracts team at CSIRO will develop cutting-edge cannabis products in their state-of-the-art lab. CSIRO is the only independent research institute in Australia able to develop drug manufacturing protocols in the medicinal cannabis space. This work will bridge the gap between the growing of plants and manufacture of medicines, with researchers developing the manufacturing protocols and preparing the first prototype products before transferring the technology to manufacturers for large scale production. The use of cannabis for medicinal purposes is highly regulated in Australia. In December the Therapeutic Goods Administration approved over-the-counter pharmacy sales of a low dose form of cannabidiol, one of the key components of cannabis that can help with a range of medical conditions. Oils, capsules, oral sprays, lozenges or other drug formats, can also be prescribed through the TGA's Special Access Scheme. There are more than 20 medicinal cannabis companies listed on the ASX and a growing number of licensed cultivators and manufacturers. Peter Crock, CEO of industry leading medicinal cannabis company, Cann Group, and Chair of Medicinal Cannabis Industry Australia, said the independent licence meant the CSIRO would be able to play a key role in helping establish a vibrant industry in Australia. ""Research that creates new and enhanced medical products and improves manufacturing processes is important if we want Australia's medicinal cannabis industry to be competitive in a global market.""

Dan puffed on the drug, sourced illegally from a friend, as his conflicted parents, Lucy and Lou, looked on. With a chemotherapy port protruding from his shirt, the young man hadn’t wanted to eat for days - a result of bowel cancer treatment. For more Health & Wellbeing related news and videos check out Health & Wellbeing >> His parents hadn’t approved of marijuana but had become desperate, trying anything they could to help ease their son’s suffering from his disease. “He just looked at us and said, ‘You’re not going to believe it but I’m hungry’,” Lucy tells 7Life after her son’s puffs on the reefer. “He asked for steak, eggs and beans - so that’s what we had.” Lucy smiles as she recalls the moment her boy went from a sickly cancer patient to gaining back some control of his life - after just three puffs of cannabis. Lucy and Lou were well-known and “conservative” members of their community in the regional NSW city of Tamworth. Lucy, a nurse, confesses now that she would shake her head at patients who said they had used cannabis to dull the pain of their condition. And Lou, a police officer who headed the drug squad for north-western NSW, was a strong advocate against the use of any illegal substance. “He spent his life locking up people who used cannabis,” Lucy says. Because of the nature of their jobs, the parents believed marijuana was a “dangerous gateway drug”. But when Dan was diagnosed with bowel cancer at 20, their lives - and beliefs - were turned upside down. “He was just a bit more than a kid,” the mum says. One day, Dan discovered he was bleeding from the rectum. A scan, colonoscopy and medical exams followed, resulting in the devastating diagnosis. “We were so desperate to try and help him,” Lucy says. When Dan’s cancer spread to his liver, doctors in Tamworth said there was little they could do for him. The family sought an opinion from a Sydney surgeon, who recommended chemotherapy and two surgeries, to remove the cancer from his bowel and liver. So Dan began his fight. The aggressive treatment took a toll on the young man’s body and he found himself hospitalised for three days after each round of chemotherapy. “The constant chemo made him so sick,” Lucy reveals. “He had chemo-induced vomiting and the hospital would eventually just have a room ready for him for after his treatment. “He would be on a drip and just lie in the dark for a few days. “He wouldn’t eat, wouldn’t drink, no talking, no TV ... nothing.” The purple-painted walls of the chemo ward had a lasting effect on Dan. “The thought of treatment would make him vomit. Even the colour purple would make him sick,” Lucy says. “It was soul destroying watching him.” Then the mum received a phone call from a member of the community who was in remission from bowel cancer. He told Lucy he used cannabis during his treatment, to help with the nausea. The man had some left over and offered it to Dan. But Dan declined, knowing the drug would make his parents uncomfortable. “We would do anything to try and help him (Dan), so I told him to bring it (cannabis) around and we would talk to Dan,” Lucy says. The parents poured their hearts out to their son and supported him to try the drug. Having never smoked a cigarette before, Dan asked if his dad would roll him a joint. “We were watching him like a bunch of kids,” Lucy laughs. “He was as white as a ghost but with his first drag his colour instantly came back. “I will never forget that day in my life. Who would have thought that a little cannabis joint would have made him feel so great.” That night, the family sat down to steak, eggs and beans - a special request from Dan. And when he went to chemo, he didn’t vomit, had no nausea and didn’t need to be rehydrated for three days in hospital. He was a changed man, thanks to the illegal drug. And he needed more. The desperate mum turned to the street, seeking cannabis from the only place she could get it - the “black market”. Disclosing that it was to help her son, she soon came into contact with other individuals who praised its benefits for people with pain-inducing illnesses. But Lucy and Lou couldn’t shake the feeling they were doing something illegal. “We were suddenly criminals,” the mum says. “We were just trying to relieve his suffering.” The family lived in constant fear that if anyone discovered their secret life of crime they would be prosecuted. So they decided to come forward and expose their double life to the local newspaper. “We just told our town that we were normal conservative people but our son was really sick and now we are breaking the law just to help him,” Lucy says. Lucy reveals they were waiting for potential backlash, particularly from people Lou had targetted during his time in the drug squad. Instead, Tamworth residents embraced the Haslams. “I would come home and there would be marijuana plants in little pot plants sitting on our door step, anonymously donated,” Lucy says. One such plant soon towered over their granny flat in the backyard. Supporters of the family posted signs up in shop fronts and along streets reading “Doing it for Dan”, offering their backing for the legalisation of medical marijuana. Lucy and Lou breathed a huge sigh of relief. Meanwhile, Dan read everything he could online about the potential benefits of cannabis oil. And Lucy purchased $6,000 of marijuana from the street - so her son could try to turn it into the precious oil. Armed with instructions from the internet, Dan searched the house for instruments he could use, and he and a mate headed into the back shed. Hours later - from the plants his mum brought home - they returned just 5ml of pure oil. “It looked like black tar,” Lucy says. “Then we had to Google how much he should take. “We had no idea what we were doing. It just shouldn’t have been this way.” Dan’s success with the cannabis oil was quickly overshadowed - as doctors revealed the cancer was spreading. But the young man didn’t give up. He continued his chemotherapy and - with the help of cannabis - his mouth ulcers cleared up, his nausea disappeared and he no longer relied on pain drugs to get him through the day. Cannabis oil gave him two pain-free years, in which he went on to marry his university sweetheart Alyce. On February 24, 2015, Dan lost his fight with cancer. He was just 25. “Cannabis didn’t cure him like we hoped, but it gave him quality of life until the end,” Lucy says. Not long after Dan died, the marijuana his parents had planted in the backyard began to bloom again. “It grew as a symbol of Dan,” Lucy says, adding she was sad Dan died before he could use this home-grown crop. A year after Dan’s death, the NSW government passed the Narcotic Drugs Amendment Bill, opening a path to the licensing of medical-marijuana growers. But Lucy hasn’t stopped advocating for better education and access to this potentially life-changing drug. “Patients are still turning to the black market to source cannabis oil,” Lucy says. Before Dan’s diagnosis, Lucy recalls judging her patients who revealed they self-medicated with marijuana. Now she is working with the privately owned medicinal cannabis company Australian Natural Therapeutic Group to advocate for better access to the drug. Lucy says a patient-nurse relationship is unique, and better training and education is needed to help nurses understand the benefits of medicinal cannabis. ANTG Chief Scientific Officer Justin Sinclair agrees. “They have a close relationship with patients and will naturally have those conversations which can educate them on the potential benefits and/or side effects of treatment,” Sinclair says. “In other countries like Canada nurses are already playing a significant role in this area. “Improving education around medicinal cannabis, to all healthcare practitioners more generally, is only going to improve safety, access and allow for more open and constructive dialogue.” For more engaging Lifestyle content, visit 7Life on Facebook Olivia Cleal / Lifestyle Olivia Cleal / Lifestyle By Dev Singh / Motoring By Jade Credentino / Motoring By Mark Trueno / Motoring Ailish Delaney / NSW News Pip Christmass / Celebrity Pip Christmass / Celebrity Olivia Cleal / Lifestyle Olivia Cleal / Lifestyle By Dev Singh / Motoring By Jade Credentino / Motoring By Mark Trueno / Motoring Ailish Delaney / NSW News Pip Christmass / Celebrity Pip Christmass / Celebrity","Jul 31, 2022 ...

https://7news.com.au/spotlight/medical-cannabis-debate-australians-left-in-pain-by-expensive-and-limited-access-to-drug-c-378990,Medical cannabis debate: Australians left in pain by expensive and limited access to drug,  / Updated 04.08.2019,"It’s the world’s most controversial plant - cannabis. As more and more countries across the planet make it legal for both medical and recreational use, is Australia being left behind? Medicinal cannabis was partially legalised in Australia for a limited number of illnesses in November 2016. But it’s very expensive, and only available to a fraction of the patients who potentially need it. ""As someone who was very against it, I would say that medicinal cannabis has not only saved my life, but it's given me life again,"" Ben Oakley tells Pete Evans. Watch Spotlight on Channel 7 and stream it for free on 7plus  >> Ben Oakley is not exaggerating. He suffers from a rare medical condition called Stiff Person Syndrome - and as the name suggests, the disease causes stiffness in muscles and incredibly painful spasms. It affects one in a million people. Ben tried a bevvy of prescribed pharmaceutical medicines, but nothing worked to stop the pain. ""Five years ago, I didn't expect that I was going to be seeing him above the ground,"" explains Ben's dad Michael, who's also a nurse. ""If it wasn't for Jenny Hallam and that incredible cannabis oil that she gave us, he would have. I will always be grateful."" Jenny Hallam is a criminal in the eyes of the law, but a hero to people like Michael and Ben. From her kitchen in Adelaide, Jenny spent years perfecting cannabis oil for medicine. She made her first batch to treat her own chronic pain, caused by a serious car crash when she was twenty. ""'You can't explain it... to have that first dose of cannabis oil and feel your whole body just relax"" ""You can't explain it,"" Jenny says. ""To somebody who has suffered for 20 years with excruciating pain and never been able to receive any sort of decent relief from the medication the pharmaceutical companies have provided, to have that first dose of cannabis oil and feel your whole body just relax. The pharmaceutical drugs don't do that. They might take the pain away, but they block up your stomach. The cannabis just made everything amazing."" Jenny learned about Ben on social media. Convinced cannabis oil could help ease his pain and relax his muscles, she sent him some of her home brew. ""I was as hesitant, as you'd expect,"" reveals Michael. ""We discussed it at length before we actually went ahead. Ben turned around and said, 'What have I got to lose?'"" ""Dad walked in and said, 'How's your pain?'"" recalls Ben. ""My average pain level is between a 6 and a 7, and the lowest I've had was probably about a 5. I reported a pain of 3."" ""I literally nearly fell over,"" says Michael. ""That was the least [pain] Ben had been in for nearly three years. It's a no-brainer."" ""My biggest fear was the fact that it's an illegal drug,"" admits Ben. Jenny’s given away her cannabis oil to hundreds of grateful people. But as word spread, the authorities got wind. In April 2017, the police arrived. She wasn't concerned for herself at all. ""I was so angry at them. All I kept thinking is, people are going to die. Kids are going to die. Who else can help them?"" Jenny pleaded guilty to drug charges and is awaiting sentencing. She faces up to nine years behind bars. But Jenny’s campaign to provide medicinal cannabis for all who need it is seen by anti-drug crusaders as a threat to society. Drug Free Australia’s Gary Christian fears if Australia broadens access to medicinal cannabis, recreational users will fake illnesses just to get high. ""When you've got recreational users using medical cannabis as their pathway to entrench this drug within our community, I don't think Australians want that,"" Gary says. He also believes the effects of cannabis are largely a placebo. Although Ben Oakley can no longer get his cannabis from Jenny, he got lucky and qualified for a rare medicinal cannabis prescription. But there’s a huge catch - the cost. ""$1,695 in advance every three weeks to provide the only medication that has given my son any form of relief,"" reveals Michael. ""As opposed to what I was getting from Jenny [for] free. The other option is I grow my own."" ""Good luck trying to stop me. I am looking after my son. You want to criminalise me for doing what's right by my son? You're in for a fight."" Morgan Taylor has Crohn’s disease, a condition that attacks the gastric system and causes severe pain, anaemia, weight loss and fatigue. ""It has affected my life in every way,"" Morgan explains. ""I haven't had a relationship, I haven't been able to work, so my mum started researching anything that could help. The one thing that kept coming up was medical cannabis."" Her mother Karen was willing to do anything to help her daughter. ""I went online and I found all these seed banks in Europe. They sell it openly, and there's a great deal of information. I ordered seeds from overseas, I had this sent to my home and I planted them."" Morgan’s parents built a greenhouse in their backyard in western Sydney and started growing dozens of plants to make cannabis juice. ""'Within a month, my life completely changed. It was miraculous.'"" ""Within a month, my life completely changed,"" reveals Morgan. ""I stopped bleeding, I stopped having pain, and I got a job. It was miraculous."" For three years, the Taylors broke the law by growing their own cannabis. Then on the 8th of December 2017, their house was raided and police charged Morgan’s dad Steven with growing an illegal plant. A sympathetic judge let her dad off with a good behaviour bond, but Morgan felt responsible for her parents breaking the law. ""Every day in this country, people are trying to help their loved ones, their children,"" says Karen. ""Then they are being dragged to the courts like criminals for trying to help their kids. This is what's happening."" For now, Australia is definitely not leading the way in medicinal cannabis. But the tide is turning slowly turning, and even the harshest critics now admit cannabis oil can help children with epilepsy. ""The one thing that it is okay for is for childhood epilepsy,"" admits Drug Free Australia’s Gary Christian. ""You actually get a reduction of about 20% of seizures over placebo for these kids. Some of them have miraculous results and most seizures go, but by the same token there are other kids who don't get any result [and it] actually makes it worse."" Jenny is realistic about the uses of cannabis. ""It is not a cure, it does not work for every single condition, and it doesn't work for every single person, but it is more effective than any other medication that is currently available."" Morgan believes it's time for the rules around growing cannabis in Australia to be looked at. ""It's breaking an unjust law. I don't know whether that law should be in place, but I guess we are breaking it."" The system within Australia also infuriates Michael. ""The most frustrating thing [is] most of the politicians that I have spoken to over this - and we have spoken to dozens - admitted to us discreetly and privately, 'Yeah, I have a smoke occasionally.' Hypocrisy pisses me off.""

Monday night’s Flashpoint will examine why cannabis oil should be made easier for patients to access and the demand for the extortionate pricing to come down. Watch the video above Watch the latest news and stream for free on 7plus  >> While medicinal cannabis became legal in 2016 at a federal level, it still remains very hard for sick West Australians to be able to use it. The strict state laws have made it so difficult for patients that people are bringing it in from other states or even more concerningly - buying it on the black market. The police commissioner, WA health minister, and the AMA will discuss the laws surrounding medicinal cannabis – showing every side of the debate on Monday night's Flashpoint. We will also hear compelling stories from parents with sick kids and palliative care patients whose lives have been changed by access to the drug. Here’s who you will be hearing from: Shellie Martin, whose daughter is on medicinal cannabis, will explain how the oils have drastically changed her child's quality of life. She will also give an insight into the extortionate costing of the drug. ""When Sophie was first receiving the first prescription that we received, the bottle was 25ml and it was $725 a bottle,"" she said. ""Over the last few years, prices have come down and now it's at $325."" The debate will get heated between those who manufacture the product and the health professionals wanting to keep the public safe. Fleta Solomon from Little Green Pharma will explain that while medicinal cannabis is legal in WA, the process to get it can be extremely lengthy because people need approval from a specialist as well as their GP. “Finding a specialist that is educated in prescribing cannabinoid medicines is one thing but the time associated with the wait, for example, some neurologists you might have to wait up to a year, and the costs to see these people is significant,” she said. Roger Cook will also open up about how he used marijuana with friends while studying at university - and he's not the only panel member who has tried the drug.

To celebrate, it’s giving away one million free plants","Saturday, 8 April 2023","The Thai government will distribute one million free cannabis plants to households across the nation in June to mark a new rule allowing people to grow cannabis at home. Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul announced the move in a Facebook post on May 8 in which he expressed his intention for cannabis plants to be grown like “household crops”. Watch the video above to see how medicinal cannabis is being used to help autistic children Watch the latest News on Channel 7 or stream for free on 7plus  >> The new rule, which comes into force on June 9, will allow people to grow cannabis plants at home after notifying their local government, but the plants will have to be of medical grade and used exclusively for medicinal purposes. Additionally, the cannabis cannot be used for commercial purposes without further licenses. The move is the latest step in Thailand’s plan to promote cannabis as a cash crop. About a third of its labour force works in agriculture, according to the World Bank. In a region notorious for harsh penalties towards illegal drugs, Thailand became the first country in Southeast Asia in 2018 to legalise cannabis for medical research and use. The kingdom has also loosened local laws around cannabis. Thai drinks and cosmetics companies last year rushed to launch products with hemp and CBD, a compound that does not give users a high, after their use was approved for consumer goods. In a further Facebook post on May 10, Anutin noted that Thai companies registered to do so could sell cannabis products that contained less than 0.2 tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the part of the plant responsible for getting people high. “This will enable people and the government to generate more than 10 billion baht per year in revenue from marijuana and hemp,” Anutin wrote. Kitty Chopaka, a Bangkok-based cannabis entrepreneur, told CNN the law was meant to pave the way for people to use the plant in medicinal teas or soups. “It will still be considered criminal if you don’t have a legal prescription and you have to be a patient of some form of ailment for this to work,” she said. “Only then will you be able to grow cannabis at home and use it however you like.” She added that, even though recreational use of the drug remained illegal, “smoking weed will happen, and there’s no way the [government] can stop that”.

The Morrison government is hoping to add to economic growth by making it quicker to get a licence to work in the burgeoning industry, for projects likely to make a big splash in jobs or exports. The pledge comes as more than 10,000 prescriptions for medicinal cannabis have been written in Australia. Watch the latest news on Channel 7 or stream for free on 7plus  >> There are currently 69 organisations licensed to cultivate or produce medicinal cannabis across the nation. But from September, the Office of Drug Control will prioritise new licences for projects that have been granted ""major project status"" by the industry department. To earn the status, the project would need to have a big impact on exports, jobs or industry development. The change comes as a review of the Narcotic Drugs Act has encouraged the government to bust red tape that is slowing down medicinal cannabis cultivation, production and manufacturing. The independent review has recommended reducing the regulatory burden for licence applicants, including the time it takes for them to apply and the level of detail they need to provide. Health Minister Greg Hunt says the government has agreed in principle to accept all 26 recommendations from the probe spearheaded by Professor John McMillan. ""Cutting red tape and streamlining processes will strengthen this important and evolving industry, and ensure medicinal cannabis is available to Australian patients under proper medical supervision,"" he said. Among the changes will be working towards one licence covering all activities involving medicinal cannabis, rather than separate ones for different activities such as manufacturing or research.

That appeal by Alex Dimitropoulos is against convictions for producing and possessing dangerous drugs and publishing or possessing instructions. Lynch, who is president of the Medicinal Users Association of Australia, pleaded not guilty to the charges against her during a previous court appearance. Lynch says she was nearly 30 years old when she first used cannabis after a back injury, weaning herself off an addictive prescription drug that had enabled her to sleep. Lynch suffers from a rare, painful and terminal auto-immune disease that led to her having her leg amputated, diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, insomnia and panic attacks. She tried unsuccessfully to get a prescription for medical cannabis in 2014. More recently doctors told her to go to a cannabis clinic where an initial consultation would cost more than $200. Ms Lynch said legal cannabis supply for medical conditions can cost $3500 a week, which was unaffordable for many. Lynch says she'll fight for legalisation so people who need the drug for medical reasons can grow their own or get it through co-operatives. She had letters from doctors saying she had been using cannabis successfully for years when she was arrested and taken to the police station in the back of a paddy wagon.

The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has flagged it intends to make cannabidiol (CBD) medicines available without a prescription. An interim decision made by the TGA would mean patients would only need to consult with a pharmacist for access to the substance. For more Lifestyle related news and videos check out Lifestyle >> Josh Fegan, CEO at provider Althrea, said the TGA’s decision was one of the biggest developments in the industry to date. “The interim decision reflects the significant shift in community and government attitudes towards medicinal cannabis since it was legalised in Australia in late 2016, which has seen it move from a fringe alternative towards an accepted mainstream option,” Fegan said. “As a strong advocate for patient access, Althea has closely monitored the proposed amendment since it began and has participated in the consultation process. “We are excited by the TGA’s interim decision to down schedule CBD products and see this development as a big step forward for prescription cannabis products already available in Australia.” Fegan added the products would need to go through a registration process that involves safety and quality checks. He said products should be available towards the end of 2021. But some limitations will be applied, including a maximum daily dose of 60mg and a restriction of a 30-day supply. Any CBD products will also only be allowed to be taken by mouth. Dr Mark Hardy from Cannabis Access Clinics said government red tape had been an ongoing issue for patients in regards to access to the product. Hardy added there was an “overall stigmatisation of medicinal cannabis”. Cassandra Hunt from FreshLeaf Analytics said about 2.4 million people would benefit from CBD over the counter.

The 26-year-old from rural Curlwaa on the NSW-Victoria border wants to find work, but the medicinal cannabis she's used for years stops her from driving. ""I still have my driver's licence, however I have signed a waiver that I can't use my medication and drive,"" Ms Gentle told AAP. For more Medicine related news and videos check out Medicine >> ""I'm disadvantaged because of a medication that I have been prescribed,"" she said. A NSW inquiry is on Thursday examining a bill that would let people like Ms Gentle get on with their lives while continuing to take their medicine. The bill, introduced by Greens MP Cate Faehrmann, would provide a defence against drug driving charges for medicinal cannabis users, similar to existing allowances for people prescribed valium or methadone. ""Medicinal cannabis is far safer than morphine and other opioids on and off the road, but it's only medicinal cannabis patients who test positive who face life-destroying drug driving charges,"" Ms Faehrmann says. Drug driving law reform advocate David Heilpern says legislation needs an update. ""When they brought these laws forward, there was no medicinal cannabis,"" he told AAP. Tests have also became more sensitive, adding to the unanticipated unfairness of the law, Mr Heilpern said. He left his 22-year career as a magistrate in 2020 after presiding over numerous cases where prescribed medicinal cannabis users faced losing their driver's licence, placing their careers and contact with family in jeopardy. ""It just seemed to me appallingly unfair,"" he said. Australians have increasingly been prescribed medicinal cannabis since it was legalised in 2016 - almost 123,000 last year according to the Therapeutic Goods Administration. That was more than double the prescriptions given in 2020. Ms Gentle was ahead of the trend, being prescribed cannabis in 2019 after suggestions from several specialist doctors. It came at the end of a long road beginning when she was diagnosed with Graves' disease. After having her thyroid removed, she spent weeks in hospital due to allergic reactions to the prescribed hormone replacements. She was eventually able to leave hospital, but the severe nausea caused by the allergy followed her home, and didn't subside until she found the right medication. ""The only thing that got me through, and has worked wonders for me, is cannabis,"" Ms Gentle told AAP. ""It was obvious in my hospital notes because I was going to hospital once every week for IV fluids and antibiotics and that stopped when I started cannabis."" But until laws change, Ms Gentle is being held back from pursuing the career in psychology she has been studying for, unable to drive to complete required placements. She's also forced to rely on family for travel due to a lack of public transport in her rural area. Ms Faehrmann says her bill is a chance to solve those problems for Ms Gentle and others in a similar situation. ""Medicinal cannabis patients shouldn't be forced to choose between driving and holding down a job and the only medicine that helps them,"" she said. The government will not be supporting the bill. ""Medicinal cannabis is not comparable to other drugs, in part due to its widespread use and availability for non-medicinal purposes,"" reads the government's submission - one of 105 to the inquiry. ""There is no reliable way to distinguish or prove whether the source of THC is illicit or prescribed,"" the government submitted. The bill - and its proposed changes to laws around crime and drugs - will likely depend on support from the opposition Labor party preparing to contest an election in March.

Prompted by the fatal crash, and the pervasiveness of COVID-19, she began to suffer from PTSD, anxiety and depression. Every time her children stepped foot outside the safety of her four walls, she was unsure if they would return. For more Lifestyle related news and videos check out Lifestyle >> Desperate for help, Caroline tried a natural ‘remedy’ - which she believes has brought her back from the brink. “I’m not a hippy, I am just your average corporate mum,” Caroline tells 7Life. Since she was a child, alternative health options have always been Caroline’s go-to. Aged four, she was prescribed Ritalin, a stimulant medication used to treat ADHD. But after just a week on the drug, her mother threw the prescription away. “My whole personality changed, I was a completely different person,” Caroline explains. For more engaging human interest content visit 7Life on Facebook From that moment, she embraced alternative treatments, a belief system she has carried into adulthood and which she has instilled in her children. “I have always sought alternative routes,” the Queensland mum explains. “We have always been on a low-sugar diet, for example.” Caroline took nutrition to the next level and even started a ketogenic diet - a low-carb, high-fat food plan. “I lost 28kg,” she proudly says. “Apart from the weight loss, I was just feeling better all round.” But she continued to battle health issues. They included premenstrual dysphoric disorder - a severe form of PMS that can cause deliberating mood changes like extreme sadness, hopelessness, irritability or anger. In 2021, stress prompted by COVID-19 led to Caroline being diagnosed with depression. Her mental health was deteriorating and she was on the cusp of losing her job. “I needed to do something,” she says. She signed up online for a 180-day selfcare challenge, aiming to post a daily affirmation to help change her mindset. But in the midst of the challenge, Caroline’s husband was killed in a truck accident - and in the blink of an eye, she became a widowed mother of three. Thrown into a world of darkness, she tried to continue posting positive thoughts online. But she was suffering from PTSD. A concerned colleague suggested cannabis oil may provide some help. Derived from the cannabis plant, CBD or Cannabidiol, is gaining popularity in the treatment of anxiety, stress and depression. In 2016, some forms of the oil were made legal in Australia - under strict regulations and with the requirement for medical prescription. Caroline sought advice from her GP who thought the oil was a good avenue to explore. Taking a small drop every afternoon, the mum says she was finally able to calm her mind and enjoy better sleep. “It doesn’t eradicate the pain, but it makes everything feel manageable,” she says. Almost a year after her husband’s death, Caroline is still grieving. But she believes cannabis oil is helping her come to terms with her grief. “CBD oil should be mainstream,” she says. “Black market cannabis shouldn’t be your first option, it should always be commercial grade.” According to new TGA studies, medical cannabis has been prescribed to more than 217,000 Australians. Of those, 42,000 were suffering from anxiety. Second to chronic pain, anxiety is the most prescribed condition for medical cannabis, with one in five scripts written for those suffering the condition. However, the TGA firmly believes education on the cannabis plant is limited. It says more in-depth studies and education are needed to truly understand its potential benefits and possible side effects. “There is a significant need for larger, high-quality studies to better explore the potential benefits, limitations and safety issues associated with medicinal cannabis treatment across a range of health conditions and symptoms,” the TGA states. Matt Cantelo is CEO of Australian Natural Therapeutics Group, one of the largest growers and producers of medicinal cannabis in Australia. He says there has been a huge shift in the past year, with a growing number of people asking for the medication. “We are seeing record demand and interest is soaring,” Matt says. “There’s been a shift from doctors during the pandemic, which means Australians are able to access regulated cannabis over black market products.” Olivia Cleal / Lifestyle Olivia Cleal / Lifestyle By Dev Singh / Motoring By Jade Credentino / Motoring By Mark Trueno / Motoring Ailish Delaney / NSW News Pip Christmass / Celebrity Pip Christmass / Celebrity Olivia Cleal / Lifestyle Olivia Cleal / Lifestyle By Dev Singh / Motoring By Jade Credentino / Motoring By Mark Trueno / Motoring Ailish Delaney / NSW News Pip Christmass / Celebrity Pip Christmass / Celebrity","Mar 5, 2022 ...

A University of Sydney-led study found that 1500mg, the highest daily medicinal dose of cannabidiol (CBD), has no impact on people's driving or cognitive abilities. Unlike THC, a cannabis component that can induce a high and impairment, CBD does not appear to intoxicate people. Instead, it can have calming and pain relief effects. Watch the latest news and stream for free on 7plus  >> CBD is a cannabis component widely used for medical as well as wellness purposes, such as to induce sleep or boost energy and is mostly consumed orally as an oil. Most countries, including Australia, allow people to drive while on CBD. In NSW, it is legal provided a driver is not impaired due to fatigue or lowered blood pressure. Lead author Danielle McCartney said CBD in general was not considered an intoxicating drug but its effects were being measured on other tasks. ""Our study is the first to confirm that, when consumed on its own, CBD is driver-safe,"" Dr McCartney said. The research, published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, involved 17 participants undertaking simulated driving tasks after consuming either a placebo or up to 1500mg doses. They completed the tasks between 45-75 minutes after taking their assigned treatment, and then again at between three-and-a-half and four hours after. Drivers had to try to maintain a safe distance between themselves and a vehicle in front of them as well as along highways and rural roads The researchers measured how much drivers weaved or drifted, their cognitive function and the oil's concentration in the blood stream. They concluded that no dose of CBD induced feelings of intoxication or appeared to impair either driving or cognitive performance. About 55,000 requests to access medicinal CBD had been approved in Australia since 2016, Dr McCartney said.

""Having freely available cannabis is not our policy,"" he told ABC radio. ""They're just proposing everyone can grow it wherever they want. That's not what we're doing. It's just not an issue I want to deal with at this point in time. ""We do allow for medicinal cannabis for people with arthritis or cancer or those sorts of things.

Jenny Hallam's home at Hillier, in Adelaide's north, was raided by police in January 2017 and cannabis oil products including capsules and syringes were seized. The 47-year-old had been supplying the drug to several people who suffered from chronic pain and conditions including epilepsy and stiff person syndrome. Watch the latest news and stream for free on 7plus  >> Supporters cried and clapped as District Court Judge Rauf Soulio on Thursday recorded no conviction against her and placed her on a $1000, two-year good behaviour bond. He said Hallam had used cannabis oil to treat her own long-term conditions, and supplied it to others in a similar situation. ""Your provision of (cannabis) to others who suffered a range of conditions was motivated by a genuine compassion to help others,"" he said. ""It was not motivated in any way by commercial gain."" Hallam said she was relieved and the outcome and her case was reflective of an urgent need for legislative reform around the production and supply of medicinal cannabis. ""I'm not a criminal, but sometimes desperate people do desperate things and these are desperate times when it comes to cannabis,"" she told reporters outside court. ""People are desperate, all they want is to heal themselves and people like me are just trying to save their lives."" Hallam had intended to take the case to trial, arguing she acted out of medical necessity in the supply of cannabis oil to those who needed the drug to relieve pain, though in February this year she pleaded guilty to the charges. During sentencing submissions in October, her counsel, Greg Barns, said Hallam had lost $20,000 supplying cannabis as a treatment for chronic pain, epilepsy and ""a range of other serious ailments"". He said the NSW-based Australian Cannabis University had offered Hallam a job advocating the importance of using organic cannabis in production, but a criminal conviction would impede overseas travel for work. Access to medicinal cannabis has been legal in South Australia for some time but it can only be prescribed by doctors under certain circumstances. Proponents say, for some people, getting hold of suitable products remains difficult. Chloe Smith, 28, said Hallam supplied her with medical cannabis for free after she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. ""The prescription drugs were making me really, really sick and I used the oil to get off of the drugs,"" she told reporters. ""It saved my life.""

Madison Williamson, 15, has been taking medical cannabis as part of her treatment for epilepsy for the past 10 months and hasn't had a seizure since, her mum says. ""Over the years the seizures changed. She ended up having cluster seizure where they could be up to 50 a day,"" Amanda told reporters in Melbourne on Sunday. For more Health & Wellbeing related news and videos check out Health & Wellbeing >> ""Within two months, I realised that there were no boxes ticked for seizures. There's been nothing since to this day. Everything has changed."" Madison has become the poster girl for the state government's decision to expand its scheme for children with intractable epilepsy to use medical cannabis from 60 to 90. ""We are going to expand the program to 90 children so that more children have the same opportunities to fully participate in society, to see a reduction in their seizures,"" Health Minister Jenny Mikakos announced, adding it would cost $3.7 million annually. Ten children will be immediately added to the scheme, with the extra 20 young people to start on the scheme next year. Canadian pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol is used in the scheme. Royal Children's Hospital paediatric neurologist Jeremy Freeman said many patients, aged from infants to 18, benefited from using the product with their other medication. ""For the patients that have a good response, the change is pretty dramatic and fairly quick,"" he said. ""About half the patients we've treated have had significant reduction in their seizures and two-thirds of those are major reduction (less than half the normal amount of seizures), about a third of those have had about a minor reduction."" The hospital has about 30 children on its waitlist for the scheme, which has also been rolled out at Monash Health and the Austin Hospital. Ms Mikakos wants the federal government to add the medication it to the PBS. The federal government last month announced $3 million for clinical trials looking at how cannabis can be used to help treat cancer pain and other side effects. Opposition leader Michael O'Brien said more work needed to be done to find out if it is as effective as it can be before it goes on the PBS. ""(But) if it is going to be effective in helping young people get through very difficult medical problems, I wouldn't have a problem with it being added to the PBS,"" he said. Victoria was the first state in Australia to legalise access to medicinal cannabis for patients in exceptional circumstances in 2016.

Perth-headquartered Emerald Clinics is listing on Wednesday after a $8 million capital raising, while shares in West Perth-based grower Little Green Pharma are set to begin trading early next week week after a $10 million initial public offering. The listings come at a difficult time in the industry, which is struggling with a glut of supply globally as legalisation has progressed more slowly than some cannabis backers optimistically predicted. Looking for a new job or job candidate? Post jobs and search for local talent on 7NEWS Jobs >> Shares in ASX-listed companies like Auscann Group, Cann Group and Creso Pharma are all a fraction of what they were three years ago. ""We did anticipate this coming some time ago - it's not surprising,"" Emerald Clinics chief executive and managing director Dr Michael Winlow said of industry's difficulties. Dr Winlow told AAP that companies have been putting too much effort into growing pot and not enough into proving the drug is a safe and effective medicine. ""It's the kind of evidence the industry absolutely needs if it's going to establish itself as a credible therapeutic option,"" he said. ""What these companies have failed to do is penetrate mainstream medicine."" Emerald has four clinics - in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and the Northern Rivers region of NSW - in which patients can be prescribed medical marijuana under the federal government's Special Access Scheme. Over 1,000 patients have been treated since Emerald's first clinic opened in December 2018, mostly for chronic non-cancer pain but also dozens of other conditions including side effects from chemotherapy, cancer pain and Alzheimer's. The goal is to treat patients while gathering anonymous, real-world data from patients that could be presented to regulators. Emerald has closed patient-data deals with customers including Spectrum Therapeutics, the medical division of the world's largest cannabis company, Canopy Growth. In the year ending June 30, it had revenue of $109,909 and expenses of $2.68 million, and expects to use the funds from the listing to expand into the United Kingdom. Little Green Pharma meanwhile describes itself as a vertically integrated medicinal cannabis business that was the first to offer Australians locally grown medicinal marijuana products, in August 2018. More than 4,500 bottles of its three different oil-based oral medicinal marijuana have been dispensed to more than 1,400 patients across Australia, and Little Green Pharma recently received its first commercial orders for 2,400 units from Germany. In fiscal 2019 it had a loss of $5.5 million on $248,500 of revenue, but says its first-mover advantage and nearly two years of successful cannabis cultivation give it an advantage over competitors. Little Green Pharma has an indoor growing facility in Western Australia that it is expanding so it can cultivate more than 110,000 bottles of medicinal cannabis oil per year. As of January 31, over 31,000 Australians have been approved to use medicinal cannabis products under a special access scheme the government set up in 2016.

While THC Global is not the first to launch its own brand of Australian-grown cannabis, chief executive Ken Charteris said it was the biggest, able to initially supply 6,000 patients this year. It would also make medicinal cannabis more affordable to Australian, as imported medical marijuana can cost as much as $200 to $400 for a month's supply, Mr Charteris said.

THC's first product is a cannabis oil that retains the psychoactive ingredient found in the smoked herb. Other more specialised tablets and capsules would come later, he said. Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration had as of April 30 approved more than 42,000 applications for medicinal cannabis use under a special access scheme set up in 2016. The TGA has approved cannabis use to treat a variety of conditions including chronic pain, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and anorexia. Mr Charteris said THC planned to export its product into Europe and Canada in the fourth quarter. ""We don't have to recertify our product because TGA is an international certification,"" he said. THC also said on Thursday it was acquiring Tetra Health, a clinic network with 1,100 active patients who mostly attend physician consultations via a web-based telehealth platform.

""People should never have to consider breaking the law to access the medical treatments they need,"" he said. The committee also wants a review of the different state and territory legislation around cannabis, with medicinal users being fined for driving on or possessing cannabis.

Mathew Sieders began taking pain medication after injuring himself at work last year. The 36-year-old was installing machinery at a job in Adelaide when he felt something go wrong. For more Health & Wellbeing related news and videos check out Health & Wellbeing >> “I just felt something pop in my back and basically that just dropped me to the ground,” Sieders told 7NEWS.com.au. “I blew two discs in my back and (they’re) two thirds out so more out than in. “It’s compressed my nerve which has given me terrible sciatic pain down my leg. “It’s like I’ve got a knife in my back.” The father-of-six from Freeman’s Reach, northwest of Sydney, had taken opioids years earlier for another medical issue and knew just how addictive they were. So this time around, he was reluctant to take them but wanted to get back to his normal life, which included running around after his children. “I was on Tramadol for three years and I created quite an association to that, which was very hard to break,” he said. “So once I had this issue, I was already aware of the fact that I didn’t want to go down the path of taking opioids again. “But it wasn’t much of a choice. I ended up back on them again.” Soon after, Mathew began researching medicinal cannabis and how it could be used to treat his pain. The 36-year-old was eventually prescribed marijuana as a treatment and now uses it daily. He says the impact has been life-changing and despite its skyrocketing costs, he says its worth every cent. “The opioids would basically take away a lot of my emotions and ... would take away a lot of my normal self,” Sieders explained. “They would also cause quite a few issues internally like constipation, eating problems. “I would constantly have to increase opioids but I found once I introduced medicinal marijuana, I didn’t need to keep increasing and I could step it down and to a point where I eliminated it completely.” Mathew said breaking away from opioids was one of the bigger challenges of his life but added once he began taking cannabis as a treatment, he only found benefits. And although the marijuana doesn’t alleviate his pain, Mathew says it helps him get through the day. “It’s really improved my appetite. It’s helped my quality of sleep,” he said. “It’s helped me mentally dealing with my pain on a daily basis. “I was finding being in pain every day was really mentally wearing and it would just make it that bit easier to get through the day without constantly running that pain through my head.” Mathew now wants to share his story to bring light to the potential benefits medicinal marijuana can have for some. The 36-year-old is also working to break down the stigma around marijuana use. “I’ve found that a lot of people’s perception is that it’s OK to be taking a prescription opioid, but why are you taking a natural product that is classified as something that only gets people high? “One has some tremendous negative effects and is highly addictive and the other can be slightly addictive.” Chief Medical Officer at Spectrum Therapeutics, the medical division of Canopy Growth, an international medicinal cannabis company, Dr Mark Ware said the drug could be used for a range of health issues. He said the two different compounds found in the cannabis flower - THC and CBD - had different effects. “THC has been the most studied to date and has been shown to have beneficial effects on neuropathic pain, cancer pain, and other intractable chronic pain syndromes,” Ware told 7NEWS.com.au. “Medical cannabis is most often reserved as a therapy for patients that have tried or considered all conventional approaches and more specifically THC has been approved as a treatment for appetite loss in patients with HIV AIDS, cancer pain, spasticity associated with MS, while CBD has been approved as a treatment for childhood epilepsy.” Ware said patients such as Sieders had reported tremendous benefits. “But like all medicines, its effects are not universal and must be treated on a patient by patient basis,” he said. And while there was a rapidly growing acceptance of the use of cannabis for medical purposes, the treatment could be explored further, Ware explained. “Because of the long history of prohibition and the stigma associated with the cannabis plant, some people and organisations have concerns about its use as a medicine,” he said. “However, the scientific understanding of how cannabinoids act in many disease states strongly suggests a potential role as a treatment for certain conditions. “In addition, people advocating for medical cannabis are often patients or families with severe and intractable chronic conditions desperate for help to improve their quality of life. We owe it to these people to explore the full potential of medical cannabis.” Olivia Cleal / Lifestyle Olivia Cleal / Lifestyle By Dev Singh / Motoring By Jade Credentino / Motoring By Mark Trueno / Motoring Ailish Delaney / NSW News Pip Christmass / Celebrity Pip Christmass / Celebrity Olivia Cleal / Lifestyle Olivia Cleal / Lifestyle By Dev Singh / Motoring By Jade Credentino / Motoring By Mark Trueno / Motoring Ailish Delaney / NSW News Pip Christmass / Celebrity Pip Christmass / Celebrity","Dec 9, 2020 ...

That’s not what we’re doing. It’s just not an issue I want to deal with at this point in time. “We do allow for medicinal cannabis for people with arthritis or cancer or those sorts of things.

Other states will surely follow. “Legalisation around the world is gaining momentum, and we want to see Australia benefit from the proven health and financial bonanza that results.” The ACT legalised the personal use of cannabis for those 18 and over in 2019, and the government this month agreed to decriminalise small amounts of commonly used illicit drugs including cocaine, heroin and MDMA.

Fox: these are just a handful of vocal A-listers who’ve gone public about using marijuana for medical purposes. Back on our shores, the cultivation of cannabis for medicinal and research purposes was made legal in 2016 - but figures released last month show that while medical marijuana use is on the rise in Australia, access remains highly restricted. Watch the full story above. “There are a number of health benefits to medicinal marijuana,” said addiction specialist Dr Mark Hardy. “Things like the control of severe epilepsy, chronic pain, nausea due to chemotherapy in cancer patients, for palliative care - these are just some of the benefits. “It’s also a potential treatment for multiple sclerosis, and things like mental health disorders, anxiety and psychosis - so there could be more to come.” The usage is very tightly controlled - as of April 2019, only 57 health professionals in Australia are able to prescribe medicinal marijuana. “It’s not universally accessible under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), and it’s also not been approved for unlimited use in Australia by prescription by any physician or doctor. “So we are beholden to the pharmaceutical services of Australia, to provide reasons for giving the drug, and to provide application for special access.” “The medical profession on a whole is a fairly conservative group of people,” Hardy said. “They’re not going to rush to give a drug where they may be uncertain about the long-term implications of being given such a drug. “We need to keep an eye on the future to make sure that we’re thinking about long-term outcomes - and I think this is one of the other reasons why GPs haven’t rushed to take it up.” “There’s over 500 cannabinoid chemicals inside a plant, and we’ve only studied a handful of them,” Hardy said. “We’re not sure if it’s a ‘golden pill’ - there’s been many things quoted as being the golden cure for everything, and this certainly won’t be that. “But there’s going to be some very useful applications for (medical marijuana) in the future. It’s exciting.”","Jun 11, 2019 ... Watch the full story above. “There are a number of health benefits to medicinal marijuana,” said addiction specialist Dr Mark Hardy ...",12,356

""It's a very worrisome situation,"" said Mark Bemberg, chief executive of the Green Fund investment consultancy. ""There is just going to be so much cannabis at some point. It's ballsy and it's risky. ... There will be a tremendous oversupply."" Looking for a new job or job candidate? Post jobs and search for local talent on 7NEWS Jobs >> The biggest project - in Australia and the world - is being planned in southeast Queensland, by the Australian subsidiary of Canadian marijuana company Asterion Cannabis. The $500 million project close to Toowoomba has been granted Major Project Status by the federal government but is still waiting on a licence from the Office of Drug Control before site work begins. Asterion's Australian director of communications Dave Holland said the massive project would employ up to 1,200 people working at a 75 hectare facility that stretches 1.3 kilometres. ""It's very hard to wrap one's head around the scale,"" Mr Holland said of the project, which would be capable of harvesting 20,000 plants per day for up to 500,000 kilograms of dry flower annually. Meanwhile, Victoria's Cannatrek received Office of Drug Control permits in September for a $160 million facility near Shepparton that will include a 160,000-square-metre high-tech glasshouse capable of producing 160,000 kilograms of cannabis per year. Chief executive Tommy Huppert said the project would create more than 400 jobs a year for the region. Privately held Canngea is also planning a facility in the Upper Hunter Valley of NSW that's capable of producing 15,000 kilograms of cannabis annually for business customers. While not as massive as the other projects, the 11,000 square metre ""pharmaceutical grade"" indoor facility would still be as big as a good-sized Bunnings Warehouse. Canngea director Nial Wheate said the indoor facility would allow it to precisely control the amount of the active ingredients THC and CBD in the cannabis plants it plans to supply to other marijuana companies. ""We can completely control the environment in which we grow our plants,"" Dr Wheate said. The goal is for Canngea's medical cannabis to be used in clinical trials and eventually be listed in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, eliminating the cumbersome process of patients having to obtain a special exemption to use an unauthorised drug, he said. At November 30, the Therapeutic Goods Administration had only approved 24,000 medicinal cannabis applications, although that figure is growing by a few thousand each month. Still, if one assumes a regular cannabis user might smoke a gram of the drug a day, that would only come to about a third of a kilogram per patient a year, putting the tens and hundreds of thousands of kilos these projects are projecting into perspective. Of course there are also opportunities for Australian cannabis overseas, particularly if New Zealand opts to legalise recreational marijuana in a non-binding referendum set for next year, as well as further abroad. Asterion's facility is planned to be located near Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport, and Mr Holland said the company hopes to export $1 billion to $2 billion worth of cannabis annually. ""We're actively pursuing overseas markets,"" Cannatrek's Mr Huppert said. But with North America well-stocked by Canadian cannabis, Mr Bemberg said that export opportunities might be limited. ""These guys will tell you they're selling into Europe. But everyone and their dog tells you're they're going to sell into Europe,"" he said. ""And they're growing their own pot there as well."" In one sign of trouble for the Australian industry, ASX-listed Cann Group recently stopped work on one of Australia's highest-profile cannabis projects, a $184 million greenhouse in Mildura, Victoria, capable of producing 70,000 kilograms of cannabis a year. Cann Group had planned to export most of that pot to its strategic partner, Canada's Aurora Cannabis, one of the world's biggest cannabis companies with a $A5 billion market capitalisation. But after Aurora announced last month it was delaying construction of its own two major growing facilities in Canada and Denmark, Cann Group suspended work at Mildura after spending $47 million on the project. It's now looking to build the greenhouse in stages, rather than all at once, but needs to renegotiate funding with its lender, a major Australian bank. ""We remain confident of the long-term strategic value of that project,"" chief executive Peter Crock told shareholders late last month. The company's stock has dropped by half since the delay was announced last month and is trading near its all-time lows. That's also the case for a number of other ASX-listed marijuana stocks including Elixinol Global and Creso Pharma. Overseas, NYSE-listed global industry leaders Aurora and Canopy Growth are both down significantly this year. Mr Bemberg said that investor sentiment had never been lower, which would make raising more capital difficult if companies found themselves in trouble. ""There will be space for big growers in Australia, but not all of them,"" he predicted.

Arguably the best female player in history, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame member, three-time WNBA MVP and 2006 world champion with the Opals was forced into retirement with chronic knee pain in 2016. But the 40-year-old has found relief since trialling medicinal cannabis and is a major advocate of the treatment that has coaxed her out of retirement to play for her hometown team Albury-Wodonga Bandits in the second-tier NBL1 from April 2. Watch the latest sport on Channel 7 or stream for free on 7plus  >> Set to play out of the stadium named after her, Jackson said she had applied for a therapeutic use exemption but would have to stop if denied. ""That's been critical in my ability to recover and come back, just the way I've been training has helped me alot,"" she said. ""I'm really thankful I got on that trial and I'll explore my options to get that exemption. ""The last few games, there was so much pain and that ended my career right there, but I don't feel that anymore."" How she handles the grind of competitive basketball again will determine Jackson's next step, with the NBL1's season running into August and the ideal build-up to September's FIBA World Cup in Sydney. The news of her return comes with Liz Cambage's Opals career seemingly over, the WNBA centre declaring she had ""zero"" interest in the program after her late Olympics withdrawal that followed an incident in a warm-up game. Jackson has the backing of Opals coach Sandy Brondello and would-be teammates and is keeping her options open despite attempting to talk down the prospect on Wednesday. ""I haven't played for eight years ... I might be terrible; there are so many unknowns at this point and I'm 40 years old,"" she said. ""The stars have really aligned for me at the moment ... to be pain free, get out and move again is what I'm hoping for. ""I was really drained, basketball had taken a huge toll on me emotionally so it's going to be a new experience for me and I'm so excited."" Jackson's Opals injection could be just the tonic for the World Cup hosts, who struggled without Cambage in a quarter-final Tokyo Games exit.

https://7news.com.au/politics/vic-to-mull-drug-decriminalisation-trial-c-5991761,Vic to mull illicit drug policing trial,"Saturday, 8 April 2023","An expert group will consider a possible trial to change how illicit drug use is policed in Victoria, despite the state government rejecting a decriminalisation push. Reason Party Leader Fiona Patten introduced a bill late last month to decriminalise illicit drug use and possession, shifting the focus from punishment to treatment. Under her proposal, police would issue a mandatory notice and referral of drug education or treatment to those found to have used or possessed an illicit drug. Watch the latest news on Channel 7 or stream for free on 7plus  >> If they comply, there will be no finding of guilt and no criminal offence recorded. The bill is set to be defeated when it is next debated in parliament, with both the Victorian government and opposition flagging their intention to vote it down. However, Attorney-General Jaclyn Symes on Wednesday offered a concession to investigate future reforms. ""The government will convene a working group with police, health professionals, addiction specialists amongst others to give advice to the minister for health and the minister for police on possible infringement trial options,"" she told parliament. ""There is no location for any potential trial."" Illicit drugs won't become legal under a potential trial and would instead result in treatment notices being handed to users. A similar working group was formed in 2020 to look at ways to assess medicinal cannabis patients' fitness to drive. When its report was released last July, the Andrews government said it would consider the findings and fund three research projects. Parliamentary Budget Office costings of Ms Patten's decriminalisation proposal, seen by AAP, indicate it would save the state $133 million due to reduced drug enforcement activity in courts and prisons from 2021/22 to 2031/32. That would be partially offset by a $52.9 million fall in drug-related fines revenue, leaving the budget $80.1 million better off over the 10-year span. Drug use is estimated to cost Victoria $8.2 billion a year in policing, court, prison, health and rehabilitation impacts as well as lost income, as per Victoria Police's 2020/25 drug strategy. Premier Daniel Andrews said the economics of the state's drugs laws weren't the only factor to consider. ""There are many things that would save money, whether they are good things to do or not is another thing,"" he told reporters. ""I'm not here to make any announcements about reforming the way the law relates to illicit drugs."" Ahead of the bill's impending defeat, Ms Patten said it wasn't the end of her campaign. ""This bill starts that conversation around treating the use of drugs differently - seeing it as a health issue, not one that should be stigmatised or criminalised,"" she said in a video posted to her social media account.

NHS England said access to Epidyolex, a cannabidiol (CBD) oral solution, has been fast-tracked to be available from January 6. The cannabis-based medicine was recommended for use on the NHS to treat two rare types of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndromes, for the first time in November. For more Health & Wellbeing related news and videos check out Health & Wellbeing >> It will be available for children from the age of two and adults in combination with clobazam, and NHS England estimates around 2,000 people could benefit. Clinical trials have shown the treatment could reduce the number of seizures by up to 40% in some children. Campaign group End Our Pain called the move a step in the right direction, but said for people in need of products containing both CBD and Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) it was ""another false dawn and missed opportunity"". A change in the law in 2018 made it legal for doctors to prescribe medicinal cannabis. However, many doctors have been reluctant to do so, citing a lack of clear guidance on prescribing and issues over funding for the drugs. This has led some families to go abroad in search of medicines, with some bringing them into the UK illegally. Millie Hinton, director of End Our Pain, said the announcement would bring joy to some families but would prolong the suffering of people who need access to products containing CBD and THC. Some families are paying around GBP2,000 ($A3800) a month privately for these products, she added. She said: ""They have been pushed to financial breaking point funding the only medicine that gives their children significant seizure control and the quality of life they deserve. Some have actually felt forced to sell their family homes. ""So, whilst fast-tracking access to a CBD-only product is a step in the right direction for some desperate families, for those that need the products containing both CBD and THC it's another false dawn and missed opportunity. ""These families need immediate action to secure NHS prescriptions for the CBD and THC whole plant medical cannabis products. ""It is unbelievably cruel to leave these vulnerable families in such a desperate state. All these families want for Christmas is for the Government to honour the promises they made to them."" A review earlier this year looked at the barriers to prescribing cannabis-based medicinal products where it is safe and clinically appropriate. The National Medical Director and Chief Pharmaceutical Officer for England will write shortly to NHS doctors and pharmacists to clarify the procedure for prescribing unlicensed cannabis-based products where there is an unmet need and it is clinically appropriate.

Cannabis laws needed reform after decades of punitive policy at the state and federal levels, the federal party said on Monday. ""Much of the rest of the world has moved on to legalise cannabis and it's high time Australia did the same,"" Greens NSW Senate candidate David Shoebridge said ahead of a policy launch in the NSW Northern Rivers town of Nimbin. Watch the latest news on Channel 7 or stream for free on 7plus  >> Regulation and taxation on legalised cannabis would make it safer for adults who use it, take money away from criminals and divert it to infrastructure like hospitals and schools, he said. ""When the government controls the supply and quality of cannabis, it is also able to provide health support for intervention or problematic use where needed,"" Mr Shoebridge said. Some 36 per cent of Australians over the age of 14 have used non-medicinal cannabis, according to Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data for 2019, with 11.6 per cent having consumed it in the previous twelve months. Those people should not be considered criminals, according to the Greens. Many people in the community use cannabis and a regulated industry could raise $4.4 billion in revenue, Greens candidate for Page, which includes Nimbin, Kashmir Miller said. Under the Greens plan, adults would be able to grow six plants at home for personal use or buy from cannabis retail shops. Licences to produce or sell cannabis would go through an Australian Cannabis Agency, which would also act as the single wholesaler. Advertising would be banned and the cannabis sold in plain packaging like cigarettes. Those selling without a licence would still be open to penalty. The party also wants a freeze on offshore gas exploration, including ConocoPhillips and 3D Oil's plans to drill northwest of Tasmania near King Island. ""To reach even the weak target of net zero by 2050, not one single new coal, oil or gas project can be built,"" Greens leader Adam Bandt said on Monday. Mr Bandt said the 3D Oil project had the potential to release 545 million tonnes of carbon dioxide if the estimated 10 trillion cubic feet of gas in the permit area was burned. ""More pollution than all of Australia emits for a whole year,"" he said. ""The people of Tasmania don't want it, it endangers fisheries and coasts and it totally fails the climate test"". Mr Bandt called on Labor and the coalition to commit to stopping the project before the election on May 21. In February, the Morrison and NSW governments rejected a proposal to drill for gas in NSW waters off Manly and Newcastle following significant community opposition. Labor also supported rejecting the exploration permit. ""If opposing a fossil fuel project due to community consensus was good enough for progressive NSW electorates then it's good enough for Tassie,"" Greens Senator for Tasmania Peter Whish-Wilson said. ""New Zealand, Greenland, Spain, Denmark, Costa Rica, France, Belize and Portugal have all implemented bans on new oil and gas exploration - there is no reason Australia shouldn't do the same.""

Post jobs and search for local talent on 7NEWS Jobs >> Cann Group chief executive Peter Crock said specialised components and materials were in transit to Australia and site work would begin immediately. The company has a five-year agreement with Canada's Aurora Cannabis, which holds a 22.9 interest in Cann Group, for the offtake of medical cannabis produced there in excess of what's needed for Australian medical marijuana patients. Cann Group had previously announced plans to build the greenhouse at a site leased from Australian Pacific Airports, but backed away after receiving estimates on how long approvals and build time would take. The site may still be used, Cann Group said. The Mildura greenhouse is expected to cost $130 million, funded through debt and equity, and should be finished by the third quarter of next year, Cann Group said.

The patients were treated for 14 nights with ZTL-101 and 14 nights with a placebo, separated by a one-week washout period, for the study by the University of Western Australia's Centre for Sleep Science. The study was double-blind, meaning neither the researchers or patients knew whether they were taken the drug or placebo but at least one study participant began to suspect he was on the real thing.

Locals told 7NEWS gang tensions were known to regularly flare in the neighbourhood, but Bennett was unaffiliated. “We lost a light here.

He did not deserve this. “He was kind to all that he met and always engaged everyone in the gym with his positive energy and engaging personality.” A US boxing club paid tribute to Bennett as a “martial arts brother” to the club and son of its late grandmaster, Randy Bennett. “Azuma at the age of 30 had inspired and instructed many people in Australia and the USA,” The Combat Academy wrote. “He had amazing enthusiasm and strength of character. He was a loyal friend. God bless you, Azuma.” His club back home in Bondi shared its devastation on losing “Zoomi”. “Azuma was part of the fabric at Bondi Boxing Club and we will miss the days when he would come in with that smile that would brighten the whole gym no matter how bad your day was,” they wrote. “He will be missed by all, RIP, little brother.

Thailand became the first Southeast Asian country to legalise marijuana in 2018 for medical use and research.

Homegrown cannabis should be used for medical purposes like traditional medicine, food and drug regulator chief, Paisal Dankhum has said previously and that there would be random inspections. The draft bill punishes growth of cannabis without notifying the government with a fine of up to 20,000 baht ($A849.23) and prescribes a fine of up to 300,000 baht or three years in jail, or both, for selling it without a licence.

The private member's bill on Wednesday from Labor backbencher Michael Pettersson would allow Canberrans over 18 to possess 50 grams of cannabis and grow two plants. In the video above: Queensland's first cannabis farm Watch the latest news on Channel 7 or stream for free on 7plus  >> Labor needs the support of the Greens to pass the bill, and they have offered their conditional support. While legalising the drug might clash with federal drug laws, Mr Pettersson on Tuesday told AAP he was ""very confident"" there wouldn't be any problems. But in a report on the bill, the ACT government said it could not rule out people being prosecuted under Commonwealth laws. ""It is important to note that, even after the passage of this bill, possessing and growing cannabis will carry a degree of risk arising from interactions between Territory and Commonwealth law,"" it said. Residents of the bush capital wouldn't be able to light up immediately, with the ACT's Health Minister needing to sign off on when the law would come into effect. Mr Pettersson said a defence exists for cannabis use under Commonwealth law if the use is excused or justified by state or territory law. ""Commonwealth law has been written with the express understanding that there are differences,"" Mr Pettersson said. ""I don't think it's particularly likely the Commonwealth government will try to fight this."" Federal Attorney-General Christian Porter said the bill was a matter for the ACT, but where Commonwealth laws applied they remained enforceable. A spokeswoman for ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr said the government had consulted with ACT Policing and the Commonwealth Department of Public Prosecutions. A spokesman for federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said any problems with Commonwealth law were a matter for the Attorney-General, but the federal government did not support legalising cannabis for recreational use. More on 7NEWS.com.au Amendments made to the original bill require cannabis to be kept out of reach of children, and barring adults from using it near children or growing it in community gardens. Mr Pettersson said his motivation for introducing the bill was to make drug use a health issue not a criminal one. ""Because of our drug laws, getting caught with a small amount of cannabis can ruin your life,"" he said. He said it would be a waste of the federal government's time to strike down the law. But it wouldn't be the first time laws introduced by the territory have clashed with federal laws. In 2013, the capital legalised same-sex marriage only to have the federal government revoke the law after it took a challenge to the High Court. Before that, in 1995, the Northern Territory legalised voluntary euthanasia only to have the federal government later legislate to stop the nation's territories from specifically introducing assisted dying.

The government's leader in the upper house Sue Ellery later told parliament there were no standing orders or conventions that enforced travel on any committee members.

Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul signed a measure in February officially dropping cannabis, best known in the form of marijuana, from a list of controlled drugs. Closely regulated use of cannabis was legalised in 2018, with several restrictions gradually eased since then. Watch the latest news on Channel 7 or stream for free on 7plus  >> Thai officials hope a major new cannabis industry will blossom, not only generating hundreds of millions of dollars directly each year but also attracting foreign tourists, who have begun returning in large numbers after being largely absent during the coronavirus pandemic. When the measure becomes effective on June 9, possessing and using all parts of cannabis plants be allowed. However, extracted content will remain illegal if it contains more than 0.2 per cent of psychoactive ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. Anutin said on his Facebook page that individuals would no longer need to acquire a permit to grow cannabis at home, as long as it was declared to be for medicinal purposes and did not have THC content above the legal maximum. Anutin said with little elaboration that one million cannabis plants would be handed out beginning in June, and people would be able to grow as many as they liked at home.

So, yes, your chance of getting more complications is there.” The problem, said Dr. Mitchell Glass, a pulmonologist and spokesperson for the American Lung Association, is that the last thing you want during a pandemic is to make it more difficult for a doctor to diagnose your symptoms. For more Health & Wellbeing related news and videos check out Health & Wellbeing >> “COVID-19 is a pulmonary disease,” Glass said. “Do you really want to have a confounding variable if you need to see a doctor or a healthcare worker by saying, ‘Oh, and by the way, I’m not a regular user of cannabis, but I decided to use cannabis to calm myself down.’ “You don’t want to do anything that’s going to confound the ability of healthcare workers to make a rapid, accurate assessment of what’s going on with you,” he added. “Chronic” marijuana smoking, defined as daily use, damages the lungs over a period of time. The end result “looks a lot like chronic bronchitis, which is, of course, one of the terms we use for chronic obstructive lung disease, or COPD,” Glass said. Smokers, people with chronic lung diseases, as well as people with moderate to severe asthma are among those at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19, including the worst-case scenario of being placed on a ventilator in order to continue breathing. Signs of lung damage from smoking even just a few cigarettes can show up in a matter of days. While a hit or two of marijuana doesn’t compare, there are some unique properties to a joint of weed that are definitely problematic for the lungs even if you’re a new smoker, Glass said. Think of what happens to a cigarette when lit and left in an ashtray -- it will burn quickly all the way down to the filter, with nothing left but ash. “It’s surrounded by paper. It’s completely dried out. It is made to burn at a very high temperature,” Glass said. “Marijuana burns at a much, much lower temperature than a commercially made cigarette,” said Glass. “Because of that, the person is inhaling a certain amount of unburnt plant material.” That irritates the lungs in the same manner as ragweed, birch and oak pollen does for those allergic to them, he said. More on 7NEWS.com.au “So right off the bat, there are those patients who would be increasingly susceptible to having a bronchospasm or cough because they have a more sensitive airway.” And since a dry cough is a key sign of COVID-19, any cough caused by smoking a joint of weed could easily mimic that symptom, making diagnosis more difficult. There’s another factor as well. As we all know, weed not only calms you down, but it messes with your ability to function -- and that does you no favours if you find yourself having a medical emergency during a pandemic. “You’re reducing anxiety, but that is still a change in your thinking, a change in the way you are handling facts, how you’re grasping situations,” Glass said. “Now there’s a healthcare worker who is gowned, gloved, possibly in a hazmat suit trying to get through to you. These are people who are trying to decide if you should be going home, coming into the emergency room, or worst-case scenario, that you need to be put on a ventilator,” he continued. “They want the person who’s agreeing and giving informed consent to be completely in control of their thought processes.” In 2018, more than 43 million Americans aged 12 or older reported using marijuana in the past year, according to the 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Around four million of those are people with “marijuana use disorder, meaning that this has escalated to the point where it’s a problem in their lives,” said Jessica Hulsey, founder of the Addiction Policy Forum, which advocates on behalf of patients and families struggling with substance use disorder and addiction. “Experts at the National Institutes of Health released some guidance for our patients and our families. saying marijuana use disorder could be a risk factor for complications from COVID-19,” Hulsey said. “Because it attacks the lungs, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 could be an especially serious threat to those who smoke tobacco or marijuana or who vape,” the NIH said in its announcement. “We need to make sure that these users are aware that marijuana is, in essence, an underlying health condition,” Hulsey added. “They should take extra precautions by minimizing use to the extent that is possible, and even start virtual treatment and a recovery journey while everyone’s stuck at home.” The national drug survey also found more than a third of young adults aged 18 to 25 said they used marijuana during 2018, along with more than 13% of adults aged 26 or older. But it’s not just the young. Earlier this year, a study found use by older adults is rising sharply. In 2006, only 0.4% of people over 65 reported using marijuana products in the past year. By 2018, over 4% of those same aged seniors say they are now using, the study found. “Marijuana use among seniors is not bouncing up and down like with other drugs. It’s a straight line up,” said study co-author Joseph Palamar, an associate professor of population health at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine, in an interview in February. Are even more Americans turning to weed during this time of crisis? Simply put, no one knows. Each state handles reporting differently, Glass says, and sales estimates often combine both THC, the main psychoactive compound in marijuana that produces the “high,” and CBD, the medicinal compound that is now sold over the counter. “I made a few phone calls and the numbers ranged quite literally from a million to 30 million. So who knows how many people are getting their hands on cannabis to relieve their anxiety during this time,” Glass said. If you’re not a regular smoker of marijuana, don’t start, experts say. “Don’t confound your caregivers with trying to sort out whether your dry cough and change in behaviour is due to the fact that you’re a novice with marijuana or it’s associated with COVID-19,” Glass said. “If you do need to see a caregiver, be sure you’re very honest with them about when you last used, and how often you use,” Glass said, “so they can get a good, clear story on what the impact of inhaling marijuana is on you.” Remember the bottom line when it comes to smoking and COVID-19, Rizzo said. “It’s common sense that anything you inhale that has been combusted and contains particles or chemicals can inflame your airways,” he said. “So you’re already making your body fight off foreign particles before it even has to fight off the infection.” Olivia Cleal / Lifestyle Olivia Cleal / Lifestyle By Dev Singh / Motoring By Jade Credentino / Motoring By Mark Trueno / Motoring Ailish Delaney / NSW News Pip Christmass / Celebrity Pip Christmass / Celebrity Olivia Cleal / Lifestyle Olivia Cleal / Lifestyle By Dev Singh / Motoring By Jade Credentino / Motoring By Mark Trueno / Motoring Ailish Delaney / NSW News Pip Christmass / Celebrity Pip Christmass / Celebrity","Apr 11, 2020 ...

NBC Washington reported that an autopsy found THC — the ingredient in marijuana that gets people high — was the cause of death. A doctor told detectives that the boy could have been saved if he received medical attention sooner, according to authorities. Clements told police she called poison control after the boy ate half of a CBD gummy and that officials told her he would be fine, NBC Washington reported. But police say Clements’ claims did not match evidence found at the home, where a detective reported finding an empty THC gummy jar in the house where he was found, according to NBC Washington. Clements faces up to 40 years in prison for the murder charge. Her arraignment is set for November 1, online records show. Poison Control says that “serious and sometimes life-threatening side effects can occur in children who consume cannabis edibles,” and recommends parents keep cannabis products away from kids. Side effects for kids who consume THC edibles can include “vomiting, dizziness, difficulty walking, a rapid heart rate, drowsiness, confusion, and breathing difficulties,” along with hallucinations, low blood pressure and an abnormally slow heart rate in severe cases, according to Poison Control. “Parents and caregivers should call poison control regardless of whether symptoms are present because signs and symptoms may not occur immediately after consumption,” the organisation says. Experts say the appearance of THC gummies is part of what makes them extra risky to leave around children. The packaging of the gummies typically isn’t childproof, and given their resemblance to candy, “when children come across them, most children are going to put that in their mouth and ingest it,” paediatric emergency room physician Dr Jill McCabe, who works at Inova Loudoun Hospital in Leesburg, told NBC Washington. If children do consume them, parents should immediately call 911 and seek emergency medical care if the child is “having difficulty breathing, not breathing well, having a seizure, difficulty walking, very lethargic, (or having) persistent vomiting,” McCabe told NBC Washington. The warnings follow a string of recent incidents in which children were hospitalised for consuming foods laced with THC. In 2020, at least two children — an 11-year-old and a five-year-old — were hospitalised after eating “Medicated Nerds Rope,” a THC-laced candy, from a food bank in Utah. A year earlier, the mother of a five-year-old boy was arrested for child endangerment after her son brought gummies laced with THC to his Cleveland elementary school, causing nine children to be hospitalised. In 2018, at least five Florida middle school students were taken to the hospital after eating marijuana-laced gummy bears, which a 12-year-old boy allegedly handed out during gym class. Medical experts said the 2015 death of an 11-month-old baby boy in Colorado marked “the first reported paediatric death associated with cannabis,” though the baby was officially listed as having died from myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, and other experts questioned whether cannabis caused the death.

The brand was launched by Marin Hopper, actor Dennis Hopper's daughter from his marriage to Brooke Hayward. Hopper Reserve is a gram of California indoor-grown flower, two packs of rolling papers, a pair of matches and a trading card either featuring Hopper and Andy Warhol or one of him in his trademarked Stetson and bolo tie. Stream the world's best reality, entertainment and true crime shows for free on 7Bravo on 7plus  >> The package is in an unassuming tin foil pouch with the slogan: ""Here's to the rebel in all of us."" The brand's website touts Hopper as ""a contradictory mix of Pabst Blue Ribbon and pop art, of rustic Americana and a new generation of restless revolutionaries, of madman machismo and the unmatched allure of a true auteur,"" while Marin says of cannabis, ""It was something he could unwind with and enjoy in a very peaceful, fun-loving way. It was very complementary to his life."" It was fairly well-known in the cannabis community that Hopper turned to the medicinal aspects of marijuana in the last stages of the cancer that took his life at the age of 74 in 2010. Kenny Morrison, who runs his own edible Venice Cookie Co., remembers Hopper's nurse coming to the dispensary where he used to work requesting cannabis tea. ""I bought some at Trader Joe's and brewed it for him,"" he says. ""He didn't want it too strong."" Dina Browner, owner of three dispensaries, including Alternative Herbal Health Services in West Hollywood, is one of the few outlets carrying the brand prior to its official roll-out later this year. She reports that it's flying off the shelves. Assisting in the marketing are United Talent Agency and Los Angeles cannabis branding company Fiorello. ""Before he passed away, Dennis told his daughter that when cannabis became legal, he wanted his own strain,"" says Browner. ""And the packaging reflects how he would've smoked it, rolling his own and lighting it with a match."" ""He wanted people to experience it just the way he once did,"" added Marin. After all, who can forget the scene in Easy Rider when Hopper, Peter Fonda and Jack Nicholson share a joint by the campfire and muse about UFOs? For many boomers, it was their introduction to marijuana. For the culture, it set a high bar for independent cinema.

Several such outlets have sprung up across the capital since Thailand decriminalised cannabis in June, a few weeks before it dropped COVID-linked controls on foreign visitors. Foreign arrivals shrank to two million in the first half of 2022 from nearly 40 million in 2019, and RG420’s owner Ongard Panyachatiraksa and others like him view their cafes as central to efforts to revive a tourism industry that contributed about 12 per cent to GDP before the pandemic struck. For more Travel related news and videos check out 7Travel  >> He said hundreds of people every day had been visiting the cafe, and he plans to open others. “Europeans, Japanese, Americans - they are looking for Thai sativa,” Ongard told Reuters, referring to a cannabis strain. “Cannabis and tourism are a match.” Not everyone agrees. In 2018, Thailand became the first southeast Asian country to legalise marijuana for medical use. In June, the entire cannabis plant was decriminalised. That has led to an explosion in its recreational use, something that government officials - concerned about negative effects on health and productivity often linked to uncontrolled use of the drug - have retrospectively tried to discourage. “The law does not cover recreational cannabis use ... and so tourism promotion is focused on medical (aspects),” the national tourism authority’s Deputy Governor Siripakorn Cheawsamoot said. The pushback against the way the new policy is being interpreted has caused some confusion, with authorities resorting to issuing piecemeal regulations such banning public smoking of cannabis and its sale to under-20s. A parliamentary committee is now debating a bill to regulate cannabis use that is expected to finalise in September and could impact the cannabis cafes. Akira Wongwan, a medical cannabis entrepreneur and one of the committee’s advisers, said she expected recreational use to be subject to zoning laws. Meanwhile, in the crowded smoking room at RG420 - a reference to Rag Gan, a Thai expression meaning “love each other” - Briton Malik Khan has just finished rolling a joint. “This country is beautiful, and there’s so much to do here as well,” the 26-year-old said. “It (cannabis) adds to the scene really nicely.” Olivia Cleal / Lifestyle Olivia Cleal / Lifestyle By Dev Singh / Motoring By Jade Credentino / Motoring By Mark Trueno / Motoring Ailish Delaney / NSW News Pip Christmass / Celebrity Pip Christmass / Celebrity Olivia Cleal / Lifestyle Olivia Cleal / Lifestyle By Dev Singh / Motoring By Jade Credentino / Motoring By Mark Trueno / Motoring Ailish Delaney / NSW News Pip Christmass / Celebrity Pip Christmass / Celebrity","Aug 12, 2022 ...

She also listed reforms to decriminalise public drunkenness, a spent convictions scheme and legislation banning gay conversion being introduced to parliament as career highlights. But Ms Hennessy said with budget initiatives being rolled out and the conclusion of the Lawyer X royal commission, the time was right to stand down. The Altona MP said she had discussed stepping down from her role as attorney-general with Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews for ""some time"". ""He has demonstrated his support for colleagues through various stages of their life journeys before, and I am particularly grateful to him for his wise counsel, compassion and understanding about my decision,"" she said.

In February the Victorian doctor announced he was stepping down from the party's leadership, citing family reasons, and would vacate his upper house seat once the party decided his replacement. Watch the latest news and stream for free on 7plus  >> Di Natale was born to Italian immigrant parents in Melbourne and went to school at Parade College in Melbourne's north. After graduating in 1987 he attended Monash University and later La Trobe University where he earned a Masters degree in public health and health science. He spent many years working as a general practitioner, travelling to Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory in 1999-2000 where he specialised in Aboriginal health, and later to India to set up an HIV prevention program. Forays into state politics followed. He narrowly missed out on the seat of Melbourne in Victoria's lower house in 2002 before finishing second to John So in the vote for the city's Lord Mayor two years later. Di Natale made Greens history in 2010 when he was elected as the party's first Victorian senator, drawing on his work in the health sector for his maiden speech. He was elected as the party's parliamentary leader following Christine Milne's resignation in 2015. ""We are the natural home of progressive, mainstream, Australian voters,"" he said at the time. At the 2019 federal election, the Greens failed to win additional lower house seats but held all six Senate spots up for re-election. Di Natale listed marriage equality, the banking and disability abuse royal commissions and the 2010 carbon price negotiations among his parliamentary achievements, along with the push for medicinal cannabis legislation and Medicare-funded dental care.

Noah McAdams was removed from his parents' custody in April when they skipped a chemotherapy session and left the state in pursuit of alternative treatments. In the video above: Florida judge denies parents custody of 4-year-old son with leukemia For more Health & Wellbeing related news and videos check out Health & Wellbeing >> Noah's parents, Taylor Bland and Joshua McAdams, and their fight for natural cancer treatment garnered national attention after a multi-state police search ensued when they skipped the chemotherapy appointment and took Noah for a consultation in Cincinnati, Ohio, with an alternative medicine practitioner. Hillsborough County Unified Family Court Judge Thomas Palermo in court Monday ordered Noah remain a dependent of the state, ruling that he will stay in the care of his maternal grandmother, according to Brooke Elvington, an attorney for Bland and McAdams. Also on 7NEWS.com.au Noah's parents will still be allowed to visit and attend medical appointments under supervision, the attorney said. Bland and McAdams are ""obviously devastated,"" Elvington said. ""Noah is going through an absolutely traumatic medical experience and he is doing so without his parents,"" Elvington told CNN. ""'Noah is going through an absolutely traumatic medical experience and he is doing so without his parents;"" In a video from court shot by CNN affiliate WFTS, Judge Palermo referenced previous testimony in which Bland acknowledged she removed an intravenous catheter from her son's arm without medical permission. Elvington said the judge referenced a domestic violence incident involving McAdams from 2016, in which court records show McAdams threw a plastic bucket at Bland and hit Noah in the face, causing a minor cut. The charges were later dropped after a pre-trial diversion program, court records show. Judge Palermo also cited familial testimony calling McAdams' mental health into question, the lawyer said. Elvington called the domestic violence incident isolated and the familial testimony unfounded. Noah, who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in April, has been in state custody since police removed him from his parents' custody in Kentucky. A dependency court judge then ordered Noah to complete the prescribed chemotherapy treatment against his parents' wishes. According to St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, about 98% of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ""go into remission within weeks of starting treatment."" Noah's parents had asked the court to allow them to forgo chemotherapy in favour of alternative treatments, including medicinal cannabis, vitamins and a dietary plan. They had previously informed doctors that they wanted to seek a second opinion and pursue alternatives, Bland told CNN. ""Noah's parents had asked the court to allow them to forgo chemotherapy in favour of alternative treatments"" Now in conjunction with the court-ordered chemotherapy protocol, Noah has been receiving THC and CBD oil for about a month, according to the family's attorney. The family was unhappy with the treatment Noah received at Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital in Tampa, and they are still pursuing oncology options at other hospitals, Elvington told CNN. The hospital earlier declined to comment on the case, citing laws protecting patient privacy. The Florida Attorney General's Office did not respond for comment. The judge ruled that Bland and McAdams undergo psychological evaluations as a part of the process to potentially regain custody, Elvington said. They have 30 days to appeal the judge's decision. A disposition hearing to discuss the Child Protective Services case plan for family reunification is scheduled for October 1, the lawyer said.

Subtitled ""The first reported case of prison-acquired marijuana-based rhinolith"", the report details how the odd medical problem came about. After receiving the contraband without prison guards noticing, the man tried to retrieve the drugs, but instead accidentally pushed the balloon higher up his nasal cavity. He thought he would eventually swallow the marijuana, but instead it stayed lodged in his upper nasal cavity and formed into a calcified lesion measuring 11-19 millimetres in diameter. More on 7NEWS.com.au: When the man visited Westmead Hospital 18 years later to determine the cause of his ongoing headaches, a CT scan was performed. The scan showed a lesion in the right nasal cavity containing ""degenerate vegetable/plant matter"" inside a rubber capsule, the report stated. The patient had experienced numerous sinus infections over the years but hadn't made the connection. A surgeon removed the mass with a fibre-optic camera and a flexible hose inserted into his nostril. Three months later the man's sinus problems and headaches had disappeared. According to the BMJ Case Reports study, only one other case of drug-bashed rhinolith formation has been recorded. In Iran, a 21-year-old man developed a rhinolith after inserting codeine and opium wrapped in a piece of nylon cloth up his nose.

Some 17 million people will vote for who they want to represent their local electorate in the House of Representatives, and candidates to represent their state or territory in the Senate. Watch the video above: How Australia’s voting system works Watch the latest news on Channel 7 or stream for free on 7plus  >> Whichever party has a majority in the House of Representatives forms government. The latest Newspoll showed Labor holding an eight-point lead on a two-party basis heading into the final week of the election campaign, while Scott Morrison narrowly remains the preferred prime minister, 43-42, over Anthony Albanese. In Australia, we have a preferential voting system. This means voters rank their preferred candidates on the ballot paper - from their first choice to their last. If a candidate gains an absolute majority from first-preference votes, they win the seat. But if no candidate wins a clear majority on that first preference count, the candidate with the least number of first preferences is eliminated from the race. Their votes are then redistributed, according to the voter’s second preference. So if I vote Miriam as my first preference and Thao as my second, but Miriam doesn’t get enough first preferences to stay in the race, then my vote goes to Thao. The process then continues through preferences until one candidate wins a clear majority. In order for a party to form a majority government, they need to secure the majority of the 151 seats in the House of Representatives; at least 76 seats. Failing to do so results in what is called a hung parliament, where no party can pass bills without gathering support from crossbenchers and other parties. So, if you’re still undecided, the key to choosing a candidate or party to vote for is to find one whose policies align with your interests. Scroll down to find the topic that matters most to you, and what each party is promising to do. Healthcare, especially after the height of the pandemic, has become an ongoing hot button issue. The coalition says it will spend $27.2 billion on public hospitals in the coming financial year, having doubled the funding since the last Labor government in 2013. The party is also pledging a record $6.8 billion over the next four years for medical research. Almost $1 billion in new Medicare funding will be made available if Labor wins the election. This includes $750 million over three years for a new “Strengthening Medicare Fund” which will aim to improve access and care for patients, as well as $220 million in grants for GPs to train staff, supply new equipment, and upgrade telehealth services. Dental and mental health care would be fully covered by Medicare under a Greens government, meaning the private health rebate can be reinvested back into the public system. The party claims this will slash waiting times and remove out-of-pocket costs. Clive Palmer says the United Australia Party would spend $40 billion in additional funding for healthcare across the country, and says it would bypass state governments to make funds directly available to hospitals. Pauline Hanson’s One Nation says it wants to boost the number of regional doctors, nurses and other critical health professionals. Newly qualified medical professionals who undertake three-year contracts in regional areas will have their HECS debt paid off. The pandemic As we continue to navigate life post-lockdowns and restrictions, it’s worth remembering the pandemic is not yet over and things may never go back to how they used to be pre-COVID. The Morrison government has invested a further $2.1 billion into the Winter Response Plan, which will ensure another 240 million units of PPE and 42 million rapid antigen tests are distributed to aged care facilities. The pandemic has been tough on our hospitals so, as a result, Labor has announced a plan for 50 urgent-care clinics, costing $135 million over four years. The Greens want to establish a National Centre for Disease Control to ensure the country is equipped to deal with future outbreaks and diseases. The party also wants to build a publicly owned mRNA vaccine production facility so more local vaccines can be made onshore, and make RATs free for everyone. UAP is running on the promise of no more lockdowns - ever. Palmer also wants to abolish the National Cabinet, formed at the start of the pandemic, and ban domestic vaccine passports. One Nation wants to call a royal commission into how state, territory and federal governments managed COVID-19. Mental health The federal budget allocated $547 million over five years to mental health services, including for regional suicide prevention programs, digital and youth mental health services and eating disorder care plans. The coalition has also doubled the number of psychological visits subsidised under Medicare from 10 to 20. Labor has committed $31 million to reinstate funding for telehealth psychiatric services over four years for people living in regional or rural areas. The Greens say mental healthcare should be fully covered under Medicare, and will spend $4.8 billion to provide unlimited, bulk-billed sessions with a psychologist or psychiatrist. Aged care The coalition’s five-year $19 billion plan includes 40,000 home care packages, over 48,000 extra training places, 7000 new personal care workers and 8400 respite services. Nearly $350 million will also be used to make pharmacy services available within residential aged care facilities to provide better access for the elderly. Labor has pledged $2.5 billion to overhaul the system, including making sure a registered nurse is on-site 24 hours a day. Albanese says the party will also introduce tough penalties on aged care providers for systematic abuse and neglect. The Greens will provide $6 billion per year to increase hours of care, introduce staff-to-resident ratios, increase wages, and improve conditions and training. NDIS Funding cuts to the National Disability Insurance Scheme have become a major issue this election, with the average participant seeing a 4 per cent cut to their plan between 2020 and 2021. While 4 per cent doesn’t sound like a lot, the impact can be potentially devastating - with many service providers already operating at a loss, any further cuts could lead to a worsening level of care. The coalition has previously insisted the cost of the scheme is blowing out but has promised to “fully fund” it if re-elected. Meanwhile, Labor’s commitment recently came to attention when Albanese was unable to detail the party’s six-point plan. Labor promises to boost staffing levels; fix regional access; reduce wasteful administrative expenses; boost efficiency; stop cuts to plans; and co-design changes to the scheme with the sector. The Greens are committing to fully funding the NDIS, including lifting the staffing cap from 3300 to at least 10,000, and improving training processes for staff. Women’s health Morrison announced a $58 million funding boost earlier this year to support 800,000 endometriosis sufferers after his wife, Jenny, opened up about her own battle with the disorder. The funding will help build treatment centres, improve telehealth services, and go towards Medicare-rebated MRI scans. The coalition will also subsidise the costs of storing eggs, sperm or embryos for Australians seeking to have a child through IVF, saying the measure will save 6200 Australians each year about $600. The Greens want to make access to abortion legal and affordable right across the country. In addition, $68.5 million would be invested into providing free sanitary items to schools. The party says this would help reduce the stigma around periods, improve students’ health and wellbeing, and ensure no student has to skip school while on their period. One Nation wants to reduce the timeframe in which women can access abortions, which currently varies across the states and territories, and ban sex-selective abortions. Hanson also says she wants to reintroduce a doctor’s right to a full conscientious objection to abortion, and mandate data reporting. It’s never been more difficult - and expensive - to enter the property market. The median house price in Australia is $1.07 million, up more than 18 per cent from March last year, with the median price in Sydney increasing by around $1100 a day last year to $1.6 million, according to Domain. It’s not much better for renters - not only have rental prices surged over the past two years but the market is unable to keep up with demand, with the national vacancy rate at a multi-year low of 1 per cent. To address the issue, the Morrison government expanded its first-home buyers scheme in the Budget, and introduced the HomeBuilder program to help eligible Australians buy or renovate a property. The prime minister also used his party’s campaign launch on Sunday to announce a plan to allow first-home buyers to use up to 40 per cent of their superannuation, up to a total of $50,000, to purchase a property, saying it would slash the time to save for a house deposit by an average of three years. In addition, 1.3 million more empty nesters will be encouraged to downsize and put $300,000 from the sale of their home into their superannuation. Labor has backed most of these measures, except the “Super Home Buyer Scheme”, which Shadow Housing Minister Jason Clare slammed as the “last desperate act of a dying government”, claiming it wouldn’t help those entering the housing market as they typically have the lowest superannuation savings. If elected, the ALP’s $329 million shared equity scheme will help low- and middle-income Australians enter the market with the government taking up to a 40 per cent stake in the property they buy. One Nation says Labor’s plan “is another step closer to socialism”, and believes the only way to make housing affordable is through putting an end to foreign ownership and lowering immigration numbers. Clive Palmer says, if his party is elected, he would make the first $30,000 paid on a home loan tax deductible each year, and cap interest rates at 3 per cent per annum for the next five years. The Greens probably have the most ambitious housing plan of all the parties, hoping to build a million publicly owned properties over the next 20 years. About 750,000 new community housing dwellings would be constructed to reduce public housing waiting lists and homelessness, with another 125,000 properties part of a shared-equity scheme and 125,000 for universal access rental homes. Under the plan, a Federal Housing Trust would be established to oversee the construction of the new homes. The rising cost of living - intensified by soaring inflation and rising interest rates, as well as the global challenges from the pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine - has fast become one of the key election issues. Minimum wage Albanese says Labor will get wages moving to keep up with inflation, including backing a 5.1 per cent rise in the minimum wage if it’s recommended by the Fair Work Commission. Morrison slammed the idea as “reckless”, accusing the Labor leader of being a “loose unit” on the economy, and insisting the $1-an-hour rise in wages would damage the economy. The Greens say they want to set the minimum wage at 60 per cent of the adult median wage. Fuel excise Neither Scott Morrison nor Anthony Albanese will extend the fuel excise cut beyond September 28, when it’s due to end. The fuel tax was halved in the federal budget, saving drivers 22 cents per litre at the bowser, or about $15 on a 60-litre tank of petrol. Tax cuts Stage 3 tax cuts are locked in, regardless of whether the coalition or Labor wins the election. Costing around $19 billion a year, it will see everyone earning between $45,000 and $200,000 paying 30 per cent in tax from 2024. The move sees the 37 per cent tax bracket scrapped for those earning over $120,000, making them the biggest winners of the tax cuts. Medicine costs The coalition has pledged to slash the cost of PBS-listed medications by $10 per script, saving Australians $150 million each year. In response, Labor upped the ante, announcing PBS drugs will cost a maximum of $30, or a $12.50 reduction per script. In addition, Morrison promised to expand eligibility for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card, meaning 50,000 more older Australians will have access to cheaper medications and healthcare, as well as be entitled to some state, territory and local government savings, such as discounted rates, electricity and gas bills, and public transport. Albanese says he would match this measure. With Australia’s global education rankings slipping, NAPLAN results flatlining and falling teaching standards, there’s no denying our education system is in dire straits. A new, stripped back national curriculum is on the way next year focusing on the basics, including maths and phonics. But it will take more than just a new curriculum to improve the sector. The coalition is planning to increase its annual funding for all schools by $8 billion, to $33 billion, by 2029. Its controversial school chaplaincy program will also continue to be funded if re-elected. Labor’s $1.2 billion investment will see additional places at universities and free TAFE courses. One year of free broadband will also be given to 30,000 families who don’t have access to the internet at home. The Greens believe a high-quality education should be accessible to everyone. As a result, $49 billion will be spent to fully fund public schools. It doesn’t stop there; the party wants to make every level of schooling, from childcare to university and TAFE, free for everyone. It says a 6 per cent wealth tax on billionaires will entirely fund that vision. UAP says an extra $20 billion will be injected into the education system during its first three years in government. While One Nation says it will restore critical thinking in classrooms, and that there’d be “no room for Western, white, gender, guilt shaming”.Early childhood education The Morrison government claims it’s kept childcare costs low, and will continue to do so, if re-elected. The party will deliver a further 20 early childhood education services in remote settings, and work towards addressing service gaps in regional areas. Under a Labor government, Albanese said providing cheaper childcare would boost participation and productivity in the workforce. The Greens say $19 billion will be needed over the next four years to ensure early childhood education is free and accessible to everyone. University and TAFE If re-elected, the Morrison government will provide 800,000 new VET training positions, and boost regional and remote apprentice numbers by giving employers a 5 per cent wage subsidy for every apprentice employed.The coalition will also spend $40 million to support 760 new teachers through extra training, especially for STEM subjects, over the next two years, as well as millions on encouraging women to undertake trade apprenticeships and enter the manufacturing industry. Under a Labor government, universities will get $480 million to deliver up to 20,000 extra places over two years. The ALP has also promised to boost teacher numbers by paying 5000 students with an ATAR of 80 or higher $10,000 a year to study teaching, and an additional $2000 if they move to a regional or rural area. As for TAFE, Labor will spend $621 million over four years to cover the cost of 465,000 places in an effort to address Australia’s skills shortage. In addition, a $50 million TAFE Technology Fund will be established to improve facilities across the country, and $100 million will be invested to create 10,000 new energy apprenticeships. As previously mentioned, the Greens want to make all levels of education free and accessible to all Australians. It’s promised to wipe student debt, and wants to guarantee every student a liveable income. UAP also wants to abolish HECS debts for all students. Jobs and Pensions If re-elected, the coalition says it will create 1.3 million jobs over the next five years with one in three to be located in the regions. It says $120 billion will be invested into infrastructure over 10 years, and $482 million to improve women’s economic security will help create more jobs and higher participation rates in the workforce. Labor says it will support wage reviews and plans to address the gender pay gap through the Fair Work Act. It will also provide new protections for gig workers, invest $1 billion into advanced manufacturing projects, and make wage theft a crime nationally. The Greens will address job security, bolster workplace rights, and work towards closing the gender pay gap by guaranteeing annual wage increases of CPI. They will also help inject funds into the arts and entertainment industries to help them recover from the effects of the pandemic. After interest rates were increased for the first time in 11 years, the coalition moved to ease pension concerns for older Australians by pledging to freeze the deeming rate for another two years. Labor has agreed to do the same. The Greens plan on lowering the retirement age from 67 back down to 65, and is committed to raising the pension to $88 a day. UAP wants to increase the age pension by $180 a fortnight, while One Nation wants to increase the amount of money pensioners can earn by $100 a week. Small business The coalition will offer tax incentives to small businesses to embrace the digital economy, and upskill and train their employees. Labor says it will require small business invoices to be paid within 30 days, reduce merchant fees, standardise disaster support payments for small business owners, and slash red tape at tax time. Both Morrison and Albanese have committed to not introducing a carbon or mining tax if elected. Both leaders have pledged to reach zero emissions by 2050 to help keep global warming under two degrees Celsius, but, wary of alienating voters on either side of the political spectrum, both have also been cautious about weaning the country off fossil fuels. The coalition is investing $22 billion into renewables and low-emission energy technology, from solar to clean hydrogen; will help fund gas-fired power and hydrogen hubs across the country; and inject money into state projects, including over $7 billion to build more dams in Queensland. Labor says it will make electric vehicles cheaper and build charging stations across the nation, as well as investing $80 million for 16 hydrogen refuelling stations on our busiest freight routes. Another $194.5 million will be put into Great Barrier Reef protection programs, plus there will be funding for various other projects including fixing local waterways and catchments, and establishing a National Water Commission. Unlike the coalition and Labor, the Greens will introduce a carbon tax in order to get polluters to pay for the damage they cause to people and the environment. The party says it will phase out coal, oil and gas, and transition to cleaner energies, creating sustainable industries to ensure people don’t lose work. The Greens will also offer households and small businesses grants of up to $25,000 to move to electric alternatives, as well as grants and loans for batteries. They will also help make electric vehicles cheaper and build a $2 billion fast-charging network, and end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030. More funding will be injected into organisations such as the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO so they can better predict the impact of climate change, and assist with future planning. One Nation is sceptical about whether climate change even exists. The party says it will build new “low-emission” coal-fired power stations, and beef up onshore oil reserves with 90 days worth of fuel. It will also support investigating nuclear power, and will withdraw Australia from the Paris Agreement. Morrison has backtracked on a 2019 election promise to introduce an integrity commission, or “federal ICAC”, saying he will only introduce the legislation if Labor promises to pass it through parliament unchanged. But critics say the coalition’s model is too narrow in scope, as voters call for accountability and transparency. Labor promises that, if elected, a National Anti-Corruption Commission will be legislated by the end of the year. The Greens say federal politics are in need of a clean-up, and support establishing a national integrity commission with royal commission powers to hold governments to account. Albanese has vowed that, if elected, a Labor government will review the anti-siphoning scheme, saying major sporting events should be on free-to-air TV. The anti-siphoning scheme gives free-to-air broadcasters the first opportunity to acquire the television rights to major events. The coalition says it will also review the scheme. The Morrison government allocated over $600 million in the Federal Budget to double the Indigenous Rangers program. Labor and Greens both have plans to do the same if elected. Labor says it will implement the Uluru Statement - Voice, Treaty and Truth - in full. It will also abolish the Community Development Program, address incarceration and deaths in custody through what it calls landmark justice reinvestment funding, get rid of the controversial cashless debit card and improve housing in remote Indigenous communities as well as strengthening First Nations job opportunities. The Greens say they will establish a $250 million national Truth and Justice Commission with royal commission powers to investigate historic and ongoing human rights abuses. More than $350 million will be spent on community-led health services; $1.07 billion to build First Nations-owned healing places; expand Gold Card access to Indigenous elders over 60; and create a compensation scheme for survivors of the Stolen Generation, with $200,000 payments to support them and their families. The Greens will also raise the age of legal responsibility to at least 14 in a bid to help fix the justice system. In the Federal Budget, the coalition committed $1.3 billion to women’s safety, health, and participation in the workforce. It’s also putting aside $189 million for domestic, family and sexual violence services, which includes $100 million over four years to support Our Watch. Labor has pledged to build 30,000 affordable housing properties in its first five years in government, including properties for families fleeing domestic violence. It has also previously said it would appoint a new commissioner for family and sexual violence, as well as creating hundreds of frontline positions under a $153 million women’s safety policy. The Greens will call for a 12-year, $12 billion package for domestic violence services. It will also support increasing crisis accommodation, paid family and domestic violence leave, and coordinated policing and justice responses. Morrison says he will reintroduce his controversial religious discrimination bill as a priority, but without extra protections for gay and transgender students. He says he would introduce the bill on its own, and amend the sex discrimination bill afterwards. Labor and the Greens raised concerns about the religious discrimination bill, saying that instead of reducing discrimination and prejudice, it would increase it. One Nation supported the bill when it went for a vote earlier this year. An election promise by Morrison at the last federal election, the bill failed to win support, and Morrison shelved it. In 2016, the federal government legalised access to medicinal cannabis. Since then, almost 250,000 prescriptions have been filled with more than 100 different cannabis products available to patients. Despite this, there is no public policy mention of cannabis in the coalition or Labor’s mandates. The Greens want to go one step further by legalising, taxing and regulating cannabis in an effort to turn people away from the black market. They also want to fund pill testing at festivals to prevent avoidable deaths, and invest almost $40 million into building safe injecting facilities in each capital city. If elected, One Nation has vowed to continue advocating in the medicinal cannabis space in order to bring the cost of access down. The party says surveillance will be ramped up at our borders to try to stop illegal drugs from entering the country, using confiscated drug money to pay for it. A Federal Police Drug Bus will also be set up in each state and territory with the intention of educating parents and students.

He’s also captained the (Australian) side (before) and had some really great success when he did captain the Australian team over in Sri Lanka, they won that series, over in India,” Candice Warner told 2GB. “I think out of nine or 10 games he’s only lost one as captain. So he is a great captain.” The former ironwoman suggested if the leadership ban did stay in place it would only hamper Australian cricket in the future, given it’s prompted the 35-year-old Warner to lean towards closing out his career playing shorter formats of the game overseas. “It is disappointing because at this stage, when David decides to retire from Test cricket, he won’t play Big Bash,” Candice said. “And that’s really disappointing for the Australian fans and kids and anyone who loves T20 cricket — the fact that David Warner will never play Big Bash again. “You also have to consider that there’s so many leagues around the world that are shorter than the Big Bash. “The Big Bash is a very long tournament. There are tournaments in Dubai in January that may be a better option with the family. David can still be with us Christmas and fly to Dubai early January for a shorter period of time. “So that is also an option as well and in a few years’ time, who knows what other tournaments will be going on around the world.” Candice’s comments come after spin king Shane Warne took aim at the Cricket Australia punishment, declaring: “How can the captain (Smith) be allowed to take up another leadership role where a player like David Warner ... isn’t allowed to.” “I would’ve thought they’re either both available again, and we’ve all moved on, and we’ve put that in the past, and you can be captain or vice-captain again, or you can’t ... I don’t think you can pick and choose one player or not,” Warne said. Warner also received strong support from Aussie cricket star Moises Henriques who labelled his career-long punishment ‘unfair’. “I definitely think that’s not fair,” Henriques told News Corp. “Anyone who goes through that and experiences that sort of outing and exile that those guys experienced, understands the ramifications of a bad culture or the consequences of when you take things too far. “Anyone who learns the hard way like that you’d almost suggest are better suited for leadership roles in the future than if they didn’t learn at all. “There’s a lot of guys in the team at the moment who didn’t have to learn the hard way, or probably learnt a hard way, but didn’t have to deal with the consequences that David, Cameron (Bancroft) and Steve did.” “I definitely think in David’s case, the fact Steve is back sharing leadership roles and will probably captain Australia again at some stage because I can’t see Pat (Cummins) playing every single tour forever. “I just think it would be silly not to tap into (Warner’s) experience of ‘geez, this happened and I came through the other side and I’m better for it’. “To just go, ‘no, you’ll never, ever be good enough or OK to lead’ (is wrong).” Cricket Australia has unofficially responded to the growing discontent with reports now emerging the governing body would be “prepared to revisit” David Warner’s leadership ban.

Analysis, local footy and the biggest moments, Seven and 7plus are the home of footy shows for every fan. Stream them all for free on 7plus  >> Corr, a restricted free agent, appears likely to return home to Victoria with his partner and sign a long-term contract with North Melbourne. In a statement on Monday night, GWS football boss Jason McCartney said the club understood Corr’s reasons for leaving and “wish him well for the future”. But behind the scenes a much more frank line was delivered in a meeting between McCartney and the players. “Giants players have been delivered a direct message in the context of Corr leaving,” 7NEWS Melbourne’s Tom Browne reports. “To paraphrase: if you don’t want to be here, then ship off. “(It was) delivered very frankly yesterday in meeting with the playing group.” The angst comes in the wake of Giants coach Leon Cameron ‘humiliating’ skipper Coniglio by dropping him for last weekend’s loss to Melbourne. The extremely rare decision stunned AFL identities, with Coniglio’s output down on expectations but not thought to be worthy of omission given his position as captain. “You know what you don’t do when you’re a leader?” former AFL coach Ross Lyon said. “You don’t humiliate. And the captain of your club has been humiliated.” It’s unclear if Coniglio, in the first year of a seven-year contract extension, will return to the side for Friday night’s do-or-die clash with St Kilda in the last round of the season. GWS, sitting 10th, will only qualify for the finals with a win and other results involving the Bulldogs and Demons going their way. The team’s form struggles have put pressure on their off-season, with Corr’s looming exit a tipping point for the Giants brass before Monday’s meeting. High-profile free agents Zac Williams and Jeremy Cameron remain unsigned heading into the trade period, alongside Jeremy Finlayson and Harry Perryman. While there are no firm indications, Cameron has been tipped to stay despite battling at times this year in an unusually tall line-up. Cameron kicked 17 goals in his first 10 games this year but since then he has been held scoreless in two games and kicked just one goal in three appearances. He kicked four goals in a win over Fremantle in round 14. Williams, meanwhile, has held off making any decision on his future as Victorian clubs circle the versatile 25-year-old. GWS put a long-term offer in front of Williams earlier this year but contract talks are now on hold. Carlton are said to be leading the race to sign Williams if he decides to leave, while Essendon and North Melbourne have reportedly shown interest.

Uber Technologies Inc is making it possible to place orders for cannabis on its Uber Eats app, marking the ride-hailing giant’s foray into the booming business, a company spokesperson says. Uber Eats will list cannabis retailer Tokyo Smoke on Monday, following which customers can place orders from the Uber Eats app and then pick it up at their nearest Tokyo Smoke store, the spokesperson said. Watch the latest News on Channel 7 or stream for free on 7plus  >> Uber, which already delivers liquor through its Eats unit, has had its sights set on the burgeoning cannabis market for some time now. Its CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told media in April the company will consider delivering cannabis when the legal coast is clear in the United States. With more than three years into Canada’s legalisation of recreational cannabis, the country is trying to fix its ailing pot market, where illegal producers still control a large share of total annual sales. The partnership will help Canadian adults purchase safe, legal cannabis, helping combat the underground illegal market which still accounts for over 40 per cent of all non-medical cannabis sales nationally, Uber said on Monday. Global cannabis stocks tracker MJ ETF climbed two per cent, while Uber’s shares were up 1.2 per cent at $US44.78 ($A61.70) in pre-market trading. Cannabis sales in Canada will total $US4 billion ($A5.5 billion) in 2021 and are forecast to grow to $US6.7 billion ($A9.2 billion) in 2026, according to data from industry research firm BDS Analytics. Asked about the possibility of expansion into other Canadian provinces, or in the United States, an Uber spokesperson said there is “nothing more to share at this time”. “We will continue to watch regulations and opportunities closely market by market. And as local and federal laws evolve, we will explore opportunities with merchants who operate in other regions,” the Uber spokesperson told Reuters. Last year’s pandemic-induced stricter mandates and lockdowns spurred demand for cannabis-related products from customers who were stuck at home with limited entertainment options.

https://7news.com.au/business/grow-cannabis-not-tobacco-malawi-leader-c-2827219,Grow cannabis not tobacco: Malawi leader,"Saturday, 8 April 2023","Malawi President Lazarus Chakwera has warned that his country's leading foreign exchange earner, tobacco, is in terminal decline and he urged a switch to high-growth crops like cannabis, which was legalised locally for some uses last year. Chakwera made the comments during a state of the nation address in which he said tobacco was expected to earn less than $US200 million ($A259 million) in 2021, a figure roughly similar to the past two years but well below previous annual earnings that used to top $US350 million. On Wednesday, neighbouring Zimbabwe's government also changed its regulations to encourage investment into cannabis. Looking for a new job or job candidate? Post jobs and search for local talent on 7NEWS Jobs >> ""The inconvenient truth... is that while Malawi has come a long way by relying on tobacco as our... largest single crop contributor to our GDP, this reliance is now seriously threatened by declining demand worldwide,"" Chakwera said. ""Clearly we need to diversify and grow other crops like cannabis, which was legalised last year for industrial and medicinal use,"" he added. Tobacco was a stain on an otherwise booming agricultural sector, which the president said would enable economic growth to recover to 3.8 per cent this year, according to the latest forecasts, and would push it to 5.4 per cent next year. That compared with last year's lacklustre 1.9 per cent growth owing to the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Decades of public health education have gradually convinced people worldwide of the dangers of tobacco, leading to a sustained drop in sales. At the same time, cannabis has started to be accepted as a medicine. Malawi's parliament passed a bill in February last year that makes it legal to cultivate and process cannabis for medicines and hemp fibre used in industry but stops short of decriminalising recreational use. Chakwera said the agriculture ministry would ""search for a basket of alternative crops so that by 2030, Malawi can do away with its reliance on tobacco"". Countries around the world are either legalising or relaxing laws on cannabis, including several in southern Africa such as Zambia, Lesotho and Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's new rules will allow investors to wholly own cannabis businesses, a departure from previous requirements to partner with the government. They also allow cannabis to be produced anywhere in Zimbabwe, instead of in restricted locations. Investors can keep export earnings in US dollars for up to four years, a government statement said.

Instead she was left visibly distressed and confused when judges inexplicably postponed the case after inquiring about her health. Watch the video above Watch the latest news and stream for free on 7plus  >> Prosecutors have recommended that Allogia, who once lived in Taree on the NSW Mid North Coast, be jailed for one year. Alloggia, 51, was accompanied at court by her Indonesian legal team and Australian security consultant John McLeod, who is assisting her case and who has become a regular at criminal trials involving Australians in Bali. McLeod, whose company Tora Solutions was involved in Schapelle Corby’s chaotic release from prison, has recently assisted several Australian drug prisoners in Bali. Alloggia was arrested on March 2 this year after 0.57 grams of marijuana oil was found in a parcel which had been sent to her from a friend in the US. The parcel also contained fabric colouring materials for use in Alloggia’s tie-dye business. Her trial has already heard that a Customs X-ray machine detected the drugs in the mail parcel which was then opened and resealed to be delivered to her. Alloggia is a self-described tie-dye artist and designer who was living on and off in Bali. She has used previous court appearances to warn against the perils of doing drugs on the popular Indonesian island. Throughout the trial, her lawyers have argued that Alloggia is a drug user who has suffered from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after suffering sexual abuse. For this reason they have sought to have the more serious charges, originally brought against her, to be dropped in favour of legislation aimed at drug users which allows for a sentence to be served in a rehabilitation centre instead of jail. Her legal team today handed a letter to the court from the police hospital, where Alloggia is being held and treated. It states that she has been diagnosed as suffering a cannabis addiction and PTSD and needs to undergo medical and social rehabilitation for six months. Alloggia was originally indicted on charges of drug importation, carrying a 15-year maximum term, drug possession carrying a 12-year term and personal use, which has a maximum of just four years and the possibility of rehabilitation. She returns to court on July 29 for the verdict.

Watch the video above. Judges in Denpasar District Court found Kim Anne Alloggia guilty of using drugs for herself and sentenced her to one year of “medical and social rehabilitation”, to be served in a hospital and not Kerobokan jail. Watch the latest news and stream for free on 7plus  >> Alloggia accepted the sentence and told 7NEWS.com.au she would not be appealing. Outside court Alloggia said she was looking forward to putting the ordeal behind her and getting back to her family. ""'I can’t wait to get back to my family.'"" “I can’t wait to get back to my family and give them all a big hug,” Alloggia, who turned 52 on the weekend, said. “I would just like to go home to my children. I miss my children.” And asked if she had any messages, she said: “Please respect Indonesian laws.” Prosecutors had asked that Alloggia be jailed for one year but the Judges decided in the end that a rehabilitation centre was the best place for her. In delivering sentence, presiding Judge Made Pasek, told the court that Alloggia had been proven guilty of abusing drugs for herself, an act which damaged her health and harmed her family and was contrary to the Indonesian Government’s policy to eradicate drugs. In mitigation, he said that Alloggia had admitted her guilt and promised not to repeat her crime. And he said that rather than jail, Alloggia should serve her sentence in the Bhayangkara police hospital to undergo medical and social rehabilitation. “The defendant is suffering post-traumatic stress disorder as she had experienced rape and sexual violence that caused her to use marijuana so she needs to get comprehensive treatment and medical treatment,” the judge said. The former Taree woman, who had been living on and off in Bali, where she was working as a tie-dye artist and designer, was arrested in March this year after police intercepted a mail parcel sent to her by a friend in the US. More Bali court stories: The parcel contained tie-dye colouring and 0.57 grams of marijuana oil which Alloggia’s friend suggested would help with her medical conditions. Alloggia’s defence was aided by Australian security consultant John McLeod, whose business Tora Solutions has been assisting a number of foreigners on drug charges in Bali. McLeod helped Schapelle Corby when she was released from jail and then several years later arranged her return to Australia and has more recently been working to assist Australians arrested in Bali. McLeod worked with Alloggia and her legal team in presenting evidence to the court that she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of a traumatic assault 30 years ago. McLeod said it was the first time PTSD had been used as a defence in the Bali legal system. It assisted in having Alloggia sentenced to spend her time in the police rehabilitation hospital and not jail and is part of a wider trend now being embraced by the Bali courts when faced by foreigners on drug charges, who can prove they are addicts and users. ""'There is a lot of good in her.'"" “There is a lot of good in her,” McLeod said of Alloggia. He said that she donates 20 per cent of her profits to a charity called Grateful Heads, which makes tie-dyed bandanas for cancer patients.

Warsaw Zoo announced on its website Thursday that it would conduct the experiment, which it hopes will improve the mood of the animals, with CBD oil producer Dobrekonopie. “We have started a project during which we will check the effect of CBD hemp oils on the mood of our animals,” the statement read. Watch the latest News on Channel 7 or stream for free on 7plus  >> “To begin with, the program included Fredzia the elephant, who after the recent death of Erna (the former head of the elephant herd) was a bit stressed and had a bit of trouble finding her position in the herd.” The oil - which does not have psychoactive properties - will be administered to two elephants - Fredzia, who is already being given it, and fellow female herd member Buba. Warsaw Zoo zookeeper Patryk Pyciński explained in a video posted on Facebook that elephants can struggle with the loss of a herd member “for weeks, sometimes for years.” This has been the case with Fredzia, who has had difficulty readjusting following the death of the head of the herd, Erna, and has begun using a “tough trunk” mentality to try to assert her dominance over Buba. Meanwhile Buba, Pyciński said, uses “cleverness” and a more thoughtful approach in her tussle for the top. “Elephants are extremely intelligent animals with very complicated brains,” he said in the video. “They’re very social animals that are interdependent on each other and as a group they create a complicated organism.” Warsaw Zoo veterinarian Agnieszka Czujkowska, who is leading the project, said CBD had already been used on dogs and horses and that they hoped it might work on elephants as an alternative to medication. The results could take months, she added. Conflicts can occur among elephants, she explained in a video, and “many factors can make an elephant feel uncomfortable and stressed” including a change of weather or environment. This in turn can lead to “undesirable” behaviour. “We would like to see how CBD oil - hemp flower extract - affects elephants. “Like most zoos we do research (and) we monitor the level of stress hormones. Thanks to this we will know if the substances (will) help the elephants,” Czujkowska said.

Theodorou left UFC in 2019 with a 16-3 record overall and an 8-3 record in the sport’s top league. One of his last bouts was in December, when he beat Bryan Baker at an event called Colorado Combat Club 10. Theodorou is perhaps equally known for his medical cannabis advocacy, noted for having earned Canada’s first cannabis exemption for professional athletes in 2020. The next year, Colorado granted a similar exemption. Theodorou said it was a first for a pro athlete in the US. Sports lawyer Erik Magraken, who memorialized Theodorou on his website, said the cannabis victories led directly to similar stances by the UFC and the United States Anti-Doping Agency. “A remarkable legacy Elias created,” Magraken wrote Monday. Theodorou was active in the Toronto marijuana community and was the “chief access officer” for the cannabis platform Leafythings, which helps Canadians find delivery services and dispensaries. Some mourners have left the snacks alongside floral tributes at Buckingham Palace and neighboring Green Park. The sandwiches are a reference to a comedy sketch featuring the Queen and an animated Paddington Bear that was filmed for her Platinum Jubilee this year. In the video, the queen said that like Paddington Bear she also favors marmalade sandwiches and hides them in her purse “for later.” The Royal Parks organization said Monday that people should not leave the snacks due to the “negative impact on the park’s wildlife” but that they could leave teddy bears and other items if they wished.

https://7news.com.au/sport/afl/clarkson-more-than-likely-to-coach-again-c-5902079,Clarkson 'more than likely' to coach again,"Saturday, 8 April 2023","A stress-free Alastair Clarkson says he's more than likely to coach again and could even throw his hat into the ring later this year. Clarkson's 17-year reign at Hawthorn came to a messy end last season, but the time away from the game has allowed him to refresh and explore other opportunities. The 53-year-old joined Tasmania's bid for a stand-alone team, spent an extended stint overseas, linked up with mental health groups and also joined a medical cannabis firm.

Stream them all for free on 7plus  >> But it seems the coaching bug is still present for Clarkson, who is weighing up a return to the hot seat. ""It's amazing how stress-free you become this time of year given that we're on the eve of a pretty exciting season,"" Clarkson told SEN Breakfast. ""I think more than likely I'll coach again, but given what I've experienced over the last six months, there's some blue sky on the side of this coaching caper. ""We'll wait and see either the end of this year or the end of next year. ""I think if I was to come back into coaching, I wouldn't want to stay out of it for too long."" Clarkson had the chance to join either Collingwood or Carlton last year, but made the decision to step away from the game for 12 months to allow him to refresh and tackle new challenges. The four-time premiership coach said he would only return to the coaching caper if it was the right fit. ""Probably what club it is and where I am in that particular stage,"" Clarkson said when asked what factors he would weigh up. ""When Collingwood and Carlton were playing off in the granny, they were the two biggest clubs in the competition at that point in time. ""I was mesmerised as a young country kid. ""Last year I had the opportunity perhaps to put my hand in the ring for either one of those clubs to coach and just the circumstances didn't suit myself or my family at that point in time. ""So, who knows if I will coach again. ""I didn't know that the grass would be so green on the other side in terms of the freshness that I've had out of having a spell having done it for so long."" Sam Mitchell, who worked under Clarkson as an assistant, will coach Hawthorn this season. The original plan was for Clarkson to coach for one more year at Hawthorn before handing over the reigns to Mitchell, but the succession plan fell apart in spectacular fashion.
