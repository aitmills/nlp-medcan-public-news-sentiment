This was published 1 year ago Andrew Forrest is the latest billionaire to enter the medicinal cannabis arena with a $5 million share placement by his family’s investment arm Tattarang into Perth-based health technology company Emyria. Dr Forrest’s foray into medicinal cannabis comes a few months after fellow iron ore magnate Gina Rinehart put $15 million behind the European expansion of another player, Little Green Pharma, in the growing sector. Andrew Forrest’s family investment arm Tattarang has put $5 million behind a Perth company in the medicinal cannabis industry.Credit:Dominic Lorrimer Emyria was listed on the ASX last year, just before Australia was plunged into the global COVID-19 pandemic, and has been progressing with trials of a synthetic cannabinoid targeting mental health which it hopes to have registered domestically and in the American market. The small company has seven patient-treating clinics around Australia which it uses to progress the development and registration of new drugs. Emyria managing director Michael Winlo said the company has treated more than 5000 people through its cannabinoid program and was preparing for an MDMA trial next year to help treat post-traumatic stress disorder. Dr Winlo said the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) was set to make a decision next month on whether MDMA would be reclassified from a schedule nine drug – which are prohibited substances – down to a controlled drug as a schedule eight. “In light of the evidence and the growing recognition of major mental health disorders and the need for more treatment options. I think there will be a very persuasive argument in front of the TGA,” he said. Dr Winlo said a MDMA clinical trial would be able to go ahead regardless of the TGA’s decision. Tattarang chief investment officer John Hartman said the investment by Emyria into “industry-leading” data collection would allow it to innovate faster than other companies and bring online new treatments quickly and cost-effectively. “We believe evidence-based, and properly registered, medicinal cannabis and novel psychedelic treatments have massive growth potential across global healthcare jurisdictions,” he said. “Emyria’s data-driven approach positions it strongly to lead the accelerated development and registration of new treatment options that can potentially benefit millions of patients.” The investment by Tattarang has seen it take a 7 per cent share in Emyria. Dr Winlo said it was great to have a long-term thinking and supportive investor which would bring a lot more than just funds to Emyria’s story. There has been a concerted lobbying push in the past few years to reclassify psychedelic drugs psilocybin, found in magic mushrooms, and MDMA, found in ecstasy, to be used in clinical settings. Former federal trade minister Andrew Robb has been one of the leading voices for change through his board role on Mind Medicine Australia. The TGA made an interim decision in February not to reclassify psilocybin and MDMA. Copyright © 2023",9,491

This was published 2 years ago Doctors are being told not to use medicinal cannabis to treat patients with chronic pain, warning there is no solid evidence it is effective, as Australia’s medical regulator approves its 100,000th cannabinoid script. Dean of ANZCA’s pain medicine faculty Professor Michael Vagg.Credit:Simon Schluter The recommendation from the country’s peak pain advisory body to doctors is: “Do not prescribe currently available cannabinoid products to treat chronic non-cancer pain unless part of a registered clinical trial.” The Faculty of Pain Medicine at the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA) says there is no robust evidence from gold-standard studies that proves cannabinoid products effectively treat these patients’ suffering. Cannabinoids are the active chemicals in cannabis. But the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is allowing doctors to apply for special access to prescribe medicinal cannabis products. Proponents argue the substances should be given the benefit of the doubt and offered to patients on compassionate grounds. Dean of ANZCA’s pain medicine faculty Professor Michael Vagg said medicinal cannabis products on the market “are not even close” to showing they are effective in the management of patients with complex chronic pain. “The research available is either unsupportive of using cannabinoid products in chronic non-cancer pain or is of such low quality that no valid scientific conclusion can be drawn,” the pain specialist and physician said. A medicinal cannabis farm at an undisclosed location in NSW that will legally produce large quantities of cannabis oil.Credit:Janie Barrett Cannabidiol-only formulations have never been the subject of any published randomised controlled trial (which are considered the scientific gold standard). “Substances like alcohol are more effective pound-for-pound but we don’t have extended opening hours at Dan Murphy’s for pain patients,” Professor Vagg said. ANZCA released its recommendation on Tuesday as part of the global Choosing Wisely awareness campaign, which highlights treatments, procedures and medications tests that have little or no evidence to support them. The recommendation has been backed by the International Association for the Study of Pain, the leading global authority on pain research, which released complimentary recommendations on Friday after a comprehensive review of relevant research. Roughly 190 different cannabis products are now available by prescription via the TGA’s special access application schemes. TGA boss Professor John Skerritt told attendees at the ACannabis ‘Evolve’ meeting - sponsored by the Medicinal Cannabis Industry Association - last week that the regulator had approved its 100,000th medicinal cannabis application in March. Roughly 64,000 patients have now been prescribed the substances by 2500 prescribers. The vast majority of those applications were for chronic pain such as arthritis, neck or back pain, fibromyalgia and migraines. Anxiety, insomnia and cancer symptoms accounted for just a fraction of medicinal cannabis prescriptions. Iain McGregor, Professor of Psychopharmacology and Academic director of the Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics at the University of Sydney agreed the evidence to back its efficacy was “very much under development”. “But this is a galloping horse heading off into the future with lots of patients already being prescribed medicinal cannabinoids and even more self-medicating,” Professor McGregor said. “One of the things [ANZCA] has to reconcile is why would all these people continue to use a product that doesn’t help them? “The TGA conducted its own review which concluded there is some evidence that it works but I agree, we need far more clinical trials in this space to give prescribers more confidence,” he said. Professor McGregor supported a “compassionate approach”. “Let’s give medicinal cannabis the benefit of the doubt while the hundreds of clinical trials around the world build the evidence base for their use,” he said. But Professor Vagg said the TGA’s analysis took a “very generous” view of the available evidence, while ANZCA’s recommendation was based on a more rigorous interrogation that considered the high risk of bias in some studies. “The TGA still found about four in 100 chronic pain patients could potentially benefit from medicinal cannabis but 20 to 25 patients would need to stop using it because of the side effects,” Professor Vagg said. ”It is such an amateur mistake to backfill this evidence gap now when this product is already being used. There should have been rigorous work to prove it’s effective and safe and then put it on the market [and continue to monitor its effectiveness,” he said. Chronic pain patients would be best served by multidisciplinary pain management clinics that teach them the skills to manage their pain, as well as physical reconditioning, assessing their biomechanics, occupational therapy and procedures or medicinal treatments with evidence to back their effectiveness, Professor Vagg said. The Medicinal Cannabis Industry Association said while the industry has only be able to legally conduct clinical trials in Australia since 2016, a body of evidence was emerging globally that supported the use of medicinal cannabis. The industry group supported the formation of an independent advisory council to inform patients and ensure access to education and training for prescribers. “[The association] believes that through a focus on balanced and evidence-based information, along with the industry adhering to high standards, there will be increased confidence in medicinal cannabis by patients, the medical/healthcare sector and community,” it said in a statement.

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 5 years ago So often in Australia, we are astounded to discover that good policy has been subverted by political mismanagement. Think NBN, gas supply, the marriage plebiscite and … medicinal cannabis. A resounding 85 per cent of Australians support legislation permitting the use of cannabis for medical purposes. It is increasingly clear that many diseases can be treated by cannabis products that have little, if any, THC,  the main psychoactive ingredient.Credit:The Age And medical specialists can indeed apply to the Therapeutic Goods Administration to prescribe cannabis-based products to their patients under the Special Access and Authorised Prescriber schemes. However, the most recent figures show that only 153 patients nationwide have been authorised to receive medicinal cannabis products under the Special Access Scheme. And only about 30 Australian doctors have been granted Authorised Prescriber status, prescribing cannabis products to a further 101 patients. Meanwhile, we believe potentially 100,000 Australians are using cannabis to treat their medical conditions but because this is illegal, the true scale of this use is unknown. Such illicit use risks prosecution and all the complications that come with using an illegally sourced drug of uncertain composition. Cannabis-using ""criminals"" include thousands of people with severe, unrelenting pain who have reached the end of the line on the prescription opioid express.  It includes children with intractable epilepsy and people with painful neurological conditions, for whom cannabis has transformed their quality of life.  Concerns with cannabis usually revolve around the adverse effects of THC – the main psychoactive ingredient. While such effects are still hotly debated in scientific circles, it is increasingly clear that many diseases can be treated by cannabis products that have little, if any, THC. Many types of cannabis, including industrial hemp, contain little THC but are enriched in other cannabinoids such as cannabidiol, which have anti-epileptic, anti-anxiety, antipsychotic, anti-inflammatory and other therapeutic effects. And there is no need to smoke. Cannabis products now come in myriad forms, including oils, lozenges, sprays, lotions, patches and capsules. An initial problem facing Australian patients seeking medicinal cannabis is that their GPs often know very little about it, and unlike Canada, where GPs can write you a script, a sympathetic Australian GP must enlist the support of a specialist to apply to the TGA for cannabis products. And even if a specialist is available, and sympathetic, they are probably not covered by their insurer when prescribing cannabis products to patients. Let's assume your medical practitioners are courageous: the next step is a detailed application to the TGA outlining the scientific evidence showing that cannabis can treat your condition more effectively than conventional prescription meds. This leads to the stoush over ""the evidence"". Earlier this year, the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine released a comprehensive review medicinal cannabis. Evidence for the efficacy of cannabis in some diseases is sparse due to the historical barriers preventing clinical trials of cannabis products. But absence of evidence, as Carl Sagan said, is not evidence of absence. The NASEM report still gave resounding support for the use of cannabis products for pain, for nausea and vomiting in people receiving chemotherapy, for spasticity in multiple sclerosis, and for various forms of insomnia. But in Australia, the TGA is reluctant to approve the use of cannabis for the conditions for which it is most commonly used in the community: pain, insomnia and PTSD/anxiety. So the TGA will grant access to patients with less common conditions – such as multiple sclerosis and intractable epilepsy –  but not to the 20 per cent of Australians suffering from chronic pain. Even if your specialist can convince the TGA that your condition is treatable with cannabis products, your mission is still incomplete. Your specialist/GP must also apply to their state or territory health department for further approval. This involves more form-filling and delay. And when you finally have all your ducks in a row, there is the not-so-small issue of cost. The TGA-approved products available to patients are extremely expensive. It may cost $120 a day to obtain cannabis products to treat a child with pediatric epilepsy, with no subsidy available from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Putting it all together, it becomes clear why only 250 or so Australians have access to officially sanctioned medicinal cannabis products. In striking comparison, Canada has more than 200,000 officially approved patients, and Israel more than 30,000. Admittedly, it is early days in Australia and profound change does not happen overnight. Yet the design of the Australian system seems to almost guarantee its failure. There are several steps that could be taken to better meet community expectations: an amnesty for current users of illicit cannabis products with verified medical conditions would be a good start. Allowing appropriately trained GPs to prescribe medicinal cannabis products without specialist involvement would also help, as would dispensing with the need for duplicate state approvals.   Rescheduling of non-intoxicating, low-THC cannabis products as over-the-counter medicines might also be considered. When manufactured according to best practice, these products are no more hazardous than many of the nutraceuticals on pharmacy shelves. Let's rethink our strategy and make medicinal cannabis products readily available to Australians in need.

This was published 4 years ago With cannabis legalised in some parts of Australia for medicinal use, businesses are positioning themselves for what is tipped to be a 'green wave' of opportunity. For Sean Dollinger, chief executive and co-founder of Canadian based company Namaste Technologies, that means regular visits to Australia and an upcoming collaboration with controversial celebrity chef Pete Evans for a cannabis cook book. ""Australia is Namaste’s largest marketplace without cannabis being legal,"" says Dollinger. ""We expect to do $10 million here and that is just on the vaporisers side, imagine when cannabis and CBD [Cannabidiol] open up. It's a very important market for us."" Sean Dollinger, chief executive and co-founder of Namaste Technologies. Credit:Louise Kennerley The 38-year-old entrepreneur started Namaste Technologies from his garage ""selling a few vaporisers a day"" and he now describes the online marketplace as a ""one stop shop"" for anything cannabis. Namaste Technologies operates in 20 countries and is listed in Canada with a market capitalisation which has gone as high as $1 billion but Dollinger's ambitions are even larger. ""Netflix and Amazon are some of the leading AI [artificial intelligence] machine learning websites in the world,"" he says. ""When you visit their websites you see something completely different to what I see. That's essentially what we are implementing into our website."" A 'green wave' is driving demand for cannabis.Credit:Rohan Thomson Dollinger says the Namaste Technologies website will suggest related products to users based on their purchasing and browsing history. ""I’m not saying I’m [Jeff] Bezos or [Richard] Branson or a [Elon] Musk yet, but I am hopefully one day going to have a company as large as theirs if not bigger,"" he says. Dollinger is enthusiastic about the growth opportunities in Australia with the federal government legalising patient access to Australian-grown and manufactured medicinal cannabis in 2016, while states and territories have their own legislation controlling its prescription and use. ""Each country has different rules and perspectives,"" he says. ""Australia obviously limits the scope of what we use medical cannabis for but when you look at Canada, that is where Canada was a bunch of years ago. Canada has done a wonderful job of rolling out the product from a medical to a recreational product."" Dollinger wants countries including Australia to use Canada as a framework. ""Hopefully three to five years from now we will start to see wider uses of cannabis in Australia and we will hopefully evolve our platform as the rules and regulations change,"" he says. In the meantime Dollinger says the main challenge to Namaste Technologies' continued growth is dealing with different jurisdictions and legislation. ""In Australia we need to be extremely careful and always abide by the rules,"" he says. While Namaste Technologies sees medicinal cannabis as opening up the Australian market for cannabis related products, Australian businesses are looking to medical grade cannabis as an export crop. ASX-listed Australian cannabis producers stocks soared last year when the federal government approved therapeutic marijuana products for export. Independently owned medicinal cannabis focused company, Australian Natural Therapeutics Group (ANTG), is one of a handful of Australian companies which have received a federal licence allowing them to cultivate and harvest cannabis for medicinal purposes. Matt Cantelo, chief executive at ANTG. Matt Cantelo, chief executive and co-founder of ANTG, says the business has signed an agreement with European giant Cannamedical Pharma to export Australian grown cannabis for German patients. ""Australian growing conditions from plant composition perspective are the most ideal in the world,"" he says. ""The Australian sun puts the plants under positive distress and produces a fairly potent product."" Cantelo says ANTG has invested ""multi million dollars"" in its growing facilities. ""We are investing heavily in the early stages in capital at the moment,"" he says. He hopes that medical cannabis will be more frequently prescribed in Australia at the moment with authorities granting 2500 approvals for legal use of the medicine in the past year. ""The medical profession really needs to be educated further than it is now,"" he says.  ""Australian doctors are quite conservative and do want to see this on home soil as well. We are at the very start of what will be one of the most booming industries in the world."" The Australian Medical Association supports clinical trials of medical cannabis to establish clinical guidelines before wider promulgation throughout the community. In the meantime, ANTG's product has found a ready market in Germany with Cannamedical Pharma sold out of medical cannabis for the next 90 days. ""Our biggest limitation is that we have too little supply coming to the German market,"" says David Henn, chief executive of Cannamedical Pharma.

This was published 6 months ago Top-quality legal cannabis can be in your letterbox within days. And prescriptions have soared by almost 4000 per cent. By Jordan Baker Australian Natural Therapeutics Group CEO Matthew Cantelo among marijuana plants in NSW.Credit:Janie Barrett Australians’ use of medicinal cannabis is surging, driven by easy over-the-phone prescriptions and products that are better quality, more reliable and cheaper than the illegal “green” market. In 2018, there were fewer than 3000 prescriptions. Last year, more than 120,000 were issued, federal government data shows, mostly for chronic pain, anxiety and sleep disorders, but also for cancer, ADHD and migraines. Yet as the industry evolves, even its most ardent supporters say it has a long way to go. It is hampered by issues ranging from driving prohibitions, cost and lingering stigma, to a lack of rigorous evidence, scepticism from the medical community, and concerns about cowboy prescribers who have a financial interest in giving it to patients too easily. The loose approach by some medical clinics is also raising suspicions of a booming de-facto recreational market; the biggest growth in prescriptions since 2020 has been high THC plant products for men aged between 18 and 31, traditionally the stoner demographic. “This isn’t Amsterdam, mate,” one doctor said in response to the subset of his patients seeking boutique products. Users swear by the medical benefits of cannabis. Cannabis flowers are often prescribed through a telehealth consultation.Credit:Janie Barrett Surfing used to leave former rugby league player Andrew Johns feeling like the tin man from The Wizard of Oz. Injuries from his footy days left him unable to run for the best part of 10 years. Sleep eluded him, too. “My pain in my neck would drive me crazy, I’d be so locked up and stiff,” he says. Now he can run around the park and kick a football with his son. He gets eight to nine hours of sleep a night. “I’m back exercising,” he tells The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. “I’m living.” Since he began using an oil product 18 months ago, Johns says he has “hardly had an inflammatory”. Other former footballers are using it too. “One in his 60s, a well-known guy, who’s had a lot of arthritic problems, said, ‘mate, I’m back walking’.” ‘I’m back walking’: Rugby league Immortal Andrew Johns credits medicinal marijuana with his recovery from injuries.Credit:NRL Photos Sydney-based 24-year-old Ash Richardson uses it in flower form – she vapes it – to help her post-traumatic stress disorder. “You don’t get high, you get normal,” she says. “I am able to get out of bed, run an organisation, leave my house.” Obtaining a prescription for medicinal cannabis is easy. I know because I got one. At 10am one Tuesday, I did an internet search for “authorised cannabis prescribers in Sydney”. Four hours later, I was in a consultation room talking about whether I should use it for insomnia. The doctor was thorough. He required my medical history. We discussed alternatives at length, which I’d already tried. We also discussed risks; for me, being picked up in a random drug driving test was chief among them. There is no legal exemption for cannabis, as there is for other medication. Ash Richardson uses cannabis to combat the effects of PTSD and insomnia.Credit:Janie Barrett He also talked me through the dizzying array of products on the market, mostly in oil or flower form, and told me that if I had been under 25, he would not have given me a prescription due to concerns that young brains are still developing. I signed a declaration that I had been informed of the risks. Then he gave me a prescription for an oil containing equal but low amounts of cannabidiol, or CBD, which does not cause a high, and tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, which does. A balance of the two - which flower products can’t achieve - reduces the effect of THC. As a so-called authorised prescriber, his scripts do not need to go through the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) as other doctors’ do (there were 430 like him nationwide at the end of last year). I went to the Cannatrek website, uploaded the documents, and paid $90 for 30ml over the phone. It arrived a few days later. A colleague, also struggling with his sleep, was inspired to try, too. He went through an online clinic that specialises in cannabis prescriptions, with around-the-clock access to a GP via a toll-free number. He was told that if he got a prescription, the clinic could also fill it, or he could find his own chemist. Over a phone call, he discussed his symptoms with a doctor, who prescribed THC oil. He used the in-house chemist. He was not required to provide a medical history; all the information he gave was voluntary. The all-THC product arrived within three days. He didn’t have to leave his house. My experience was gold standard. My colleague’s wasn’t. Experiences such as his have raised concerns that obtaining prescriptions for medicinal cannabis can be too easy. Lucy Haslam and her husband, a former drug squad officer, became advocates for medicinal cannabis after watching it help their son during his cancer treatment. But she fears patients are not getting “the best level of care” under the online clinic model. “I’ve heard of patients that have gone to clinics and walked away with six or seven or eight products after very little clinical evaluation,” she says. “They’ve spent more money than they’ve needed to, they’ve been prescribed things they don’t need, and it’s cost them a small fortune.” Medicinal marijuana campaigner Lucy Haslam.Credit:Peter Rae There are also concerns some clinics have a profit motive; because they also have a pharmacy licence, they claim the doctor’s consult fee and the chemist’s mark-up on the product. Some doctors prescribe products in which the clinic they work for has a financial interest. Source: FreshLeaf analytics, TGA “[A system in which clinics] have a vested commercial interest in a product they’re prescribing is going to be fraught with danger,” Haslam says. “That gives the industry a bad reputation, particularly when you’re trying to get conservative medical practitioners on board. They think it’s just a bunch of cowboys, and are reluctant to get involved.” A medical specialist, speaking on condition of anonymity, says, “if you are feeling lethargic you don’t go to a thyroid dispensary clinic, you go to your GP. Not everyone needs medical cannabis - 50 per cent of people should be told they don’t need it. That is not happening.” In a statement, the TGA said it had not turned down a prescription application since August 2020. Between 2015 and 2020, seven were refused. There is no data on how many doctors refused to write scripts. ""Medico-legal responsibility for prescribing an unapproved product rests with the prescriber,"" it said. Iain McGregor, the academic director of Sydney University’s Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics, says most clinics are doing a good job, but there are pockets of inappropriate prescribing. “The [TGA] doesn’t quite have the mechanisms in place to deal with that,” he says. “I don’t think we’re at the point where we need to shut the system down because of unscrupulous individuals, but there are legitimate concerns about what’s going on.” The first company to start producing cannabis oil will have an advantage in the highly lucrative market. Credit:Janie Barrett The lack of medical rigour among some clinics is also fuelling suspicions that recreational users are now obtaining their cannabis through doctors. The rise in popularity of flower products backs the theory. While oil products can have equal mixes of THC and CBD, which balances the intoxicating effect of THC – allowing users to, as one doctor put it, “hold down a job and look after kids” – flower products have a ratio of about five parts THC to one of CBD. In mid-September, ASX-listed cannabis producer Althea said dried flower was the fastest-growing category in the country and now made up half the market. “The dried flower market is primarily [driven] by highly-concentrated THC product,” it said in a statement to the stock exchange. A report from FreshLeaf analytics found that by the third quarter of 2021, medicinal flower was cheaper per gram than so-called “green market” flower. In an interview with Cannabiz magazine, Byron Bay doctor Jamie Rickcord said the word was out “that medical stuff is far superior and many people want access to it. They are using a medical condition to get legal access to the best flower they have ever seen. “People say I want to try the Blueberry Haze or the Purple Haze or whatever and I’m like, bollocks, this isn’t Amsterdam, mate ... THC is an amazing compound and a fabulous medicine, but it’s not there to get us all stoned.” Some argue chasing prescriptions for recreational use undermines the medical legitimacy of the drug. It’s not what the TGA had in mind when, back in 2016, it created a system under which it would approve applications from doctors. But others say it’s not a bad thing; at least these users, who may have been self-medicating conditions such as anxiety with illegal products, have some kind of medical oversight. “You have people getting a quality-assured product, they’re getting secured supply, although some of the consultations may not be great, and they’re at least seeing a medical health professional,” says McGregor. On Tuesday, the TGA issued 73 infringement notices worth almost $1 million to three medical cannabis companies, including Cannatrek, for promoting prescription-only products. Some of the advertising also allegedly referred to the treatment of serious illnesses and implied that particular products were recommended by a government authority. Cannabis is placed inside a vape.Credit:Janie Barrett Ash Richardson, who runs pro-legalisation lobby group Green Revolution Australia, suffered abuse as a child, and used to self-medicate with cannabis before she sought out a prescription for the medical version in 2020 for her PTSD (it’s also used by war veterans with the same condition). She vapes the Sativa species, “the less couch-cooked kind”, in the morning, and the Indica species at night. “I was having really severe flashbacks and panic attacks for a long time before I started using medical cannabis,” she says. “I haven’t had a panic attack in about seven months. It certainly helps with anxiety.” The Age and Herald spoke to many people about their cannabis use; Richardson and Johns were the only ones willing to speak on the record, although the late Olivia Newton-John, who used it for cancer, and basketballer Lauren Jackson, who used it for pain management, have also been open about it. “In this society, it’s still people being scared of the repercussions of their job, their family, the driving laws,” Richardson says. The containers dried buds are stored in.Credit:Janie Barrett Medical cannabis is what’s known as an unregistered medicine, which means that, despite the many users who swear by its benefits, its efficacy has not been proven through robust medical tests. There are a few reasons for the rapid growth in cannabis prescriptions from 2020, but the biggest one is the telehealth revolution driven by COVID-19. Previously, people had gone to GPs, most of whom didn’t know much about it or didn’t trust it as a drug. “Telehealth allowed people to find a prescriber who is motivated to consider medical cannabis,” says Rhys Cohen, an industry expert, speaking on behalf of Medicinal Cannabis Industry Australia. “It’s easier to do that by Googling ‘cannabis doctor’ rather than cycling through various GPs in the community.” It’s expensive, but the costs are slowly falling. A FreshLeaf Analytics report found the average monthly spend by patients has fallen from more than $400 a month in the first quarter of 2020 to $278 a month in the third quarter of 2021, even as the average dose increased. There’s no Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme subsidy for the vast majority of its uses, but there is for multiple sclerosis and for a form of paediatric epilepsy; the Department of Veterans Affairs will also subsidise it for pain, and some private health insurers give rebates. Technically, products with low doses of cannabinoid oil can now be sold in Australian pharmacies but there are still none available on shelves because, unlike vitamin products, the manufacturer must supply robust evidence that it works. It’s more expensive than other drugs, yet the rules around growing and manufacturing are so stringent that most of the growers and manufacturers that have sprung up in Australia are yet to make a profit. Imports are cheaper. Share prices are tanking. “You’ve got a bizarre situation in which you can grow opium poppies behind a farm fence, but if you grow cannabis you need [secure] facilities and dogs,” says McGregor. “Perhaps in retrospect it was a bit too demanding, the restrictions on cultivation. If they could grow a crop the way they could soybeans or maze, it might make the industry more financially viable.” Next year, new laws will require imported products to meet the same manufacturing standards as local ones, which the industry hopes will create a level playing field for local products, even though questions remain about how the laws will be policed. Despite Harmer’s reservations about the industry, she still believes in the product. “People are sticking with it despite the high costs, you don’t do that if it’s not working,” she says. “More and more doctors are becoming strong advocates.” Pain specialist Professor Marc Russo is a convert. He saw the benefits for people with neuropathic pain (caused by nerve damage). “I wasn’t able to ignore the evidence in front of my eyes on these patients,” he says. While it does not seem to diminish the pain much, Russo says it helps their sleep and “also appears to decrease patient distress whilst leaving them quite clear-headed and cognitively intact”. Unless Australia legalises recreational use, the key to the future of a viable, respected medicinal cannabis industry is research. Only hard evidence will win over cautious general practitioners and get CBD oil onto chemists’ shelves. Much of the research is coming out of the Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics at the University of Sydney. Dozens of trials have begun since 2016, including high doses of cannabidiol for spinal cord injury pain, if cannabis can ease anxiety linked to anorexia, and how different combinations help sleep. The Lambert Initiative is also investigating the effectiveness of some other compounds found in the cannabis plant, such as cannabinol or CBN, a form of non-intoxicating aged THC, for sleep, and cannabigerol (CBG), derived from younger plants, for osteoarthritis. It’s in the industry’s interest to participate in research, where it can afford to. However, if cannabis becomes legal, that interest could fade. “What you’ve seen in Canada since 2018, when they legalised recreational use, is that a lot of the companies just exited [research and development],” says McGregor. “We have to be careful about that.” The legalisation in Canada has also led to about $CAD15 billion ($16.8 billion) worth of taxes. My bottle of cannabis oil sat locked in the medicine cabinet until I was game to try it. One night when I had no need to drive the next day and no responsibility for children, I measured 2ml in a dropper and tasted that distinctive flavour under my tongue. There was no intoxication. I slept beautifully for half the night then woke up at 4am unable to get back to sleep. On a few more occasions, the same thing happened. Medical cannabis dosing is an inexact science; as the doctor warned me, it takes a while to work out what works. For me, messing about with dosage was not worth the potential downsides, such as putting my driver’s licence at risk. I’ll wait for a while, perhaps for a time which Cohen hopes is not too far away, when medical cannabis is accepted to the level that it is boring and “there are evidence-based medicines that are registered, that are proven, and doctors can consider them like any other medicine”.

This was published 10 months ago New research has confirmed taking even very high levels of cannabidiol (CBD), a medicinal product derived from cannabis, has no impact on people’s ability to drive. Researchers from the University of Sydney have conducted a study of the impact of CBD on people’s cognitive ability, specifically whether it affects people’s ability to drive in the same way other medicines can. New research confirms cannabidiol (CBD) does not impair people’s ability to drive even at high doses.Credit:iStock  Lead research author Dr Danielle McCartney said on every measure they could not find any effect of CBD on a person’s ability to operate a vehicle. “The finding speaks for itself somewhat, we didn’t find any effect on driving performance or cognitive function,” she said. “We assessed a few different aspects of cognitive function, and when people reported subjectively how they felt, they didn’t report any signs or symptoms of intoxication,” she said. The study featured 17 participants who were given either a placebo or 15 milligrams, 300 milligrams or 1500 milligrams of CBD (the maximum daily dose currently permitted). No adverse cognitive effects were found from any level of the drug, with the tests including practical testing as well as self-reporting of any effects. Participants undertook simulated driving exercises between 45-75 minutes after taking their assigned treatment, and then again at between 3.5 and four hours after. CBD is becoming increasingly used around the world including in Australia for a range of conditions, from epilepsy and chronic pain to sleep disorders and anxiety conditions. Previous University of Sydney research found 55,000 requests to access medicinal CBD have been approved in Australia since 2016. CBD is a separate chemical from THC, which is the compound in cannabis which gets you “high” when used recreationally, and which does cause impairment to cognitive and driving ability. Some medicinal cannabis products contain both CBD and THC, and are referred to as nabiximols, and are available to be prescribed in Australia, but at a higher drug classification than medicines which only contain CBD. Police also conduct roadside drug tests which include tests for cannabis, although those tests specifically test for THC rather than CBD. McCartney said they did conduct some research into whether the CBD medicines produced positive results on two of the most common tests used by police in NSW, and found that they did not. “We didn’t observe any false positive tests, so if people are taking CBD medication, they can be fairly confident that they will not impair their driving and they will not test positive for cannabis,” she said. McCartney did sound a note of caution about the findings, stressing that they only looked at the effect of CBD on driving ability in isolation, and did not look at how it might interact with other medications. “At the moment there are a number of drugs which are impairing which people are legally allowed to take and still drive, like opioids and benzodiazepines,” she said. “CBD could interact with these substances, but whether it exacerbates their effects or has a different effect is something which needs more research to determine.” The research has been published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology.

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 2 years ago On a back country road in northern NSW, up a nondescript dirt driveway, sits a highly secret facility. Surrounded by strict security, thousands of cannabis plants are being carefully cultivated in state-of-the-art greenhouses for the medicinal cannabis market. Australian Natural Therapeutics Group CEO, Matthew Cantelo, surrounded by cannabis that is about to be harvested.Credit:Janie Barrett The Australian Natural Therapeutics Group facility, near Armidale, is about to start producing medicinal cannabis oil on a commercial scale – the first such manufacturing licence granted in the state. The company's chief executive Matthew Cantelo said he had noticed quite a large increase of approvals under the Special Access Scheme, as well as a rise in the number of authorised prescribers. ""[That] tells us that doctors are having more confidence in the safety and efficacy of the products,"" he said. ""Also, the research is catching up."" Professor Iain McGregor, from the Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics at the University of Sydney, said there was ""increasingly good evidence"" that cannabis was effective. ""It helps people get off more sinister drugs, particularly prescription opioids and Lyrica-type drugs as well, which can be very problematic,"" he said. Cannabis has two main chemical components. THC is the psychoactive ingredient, responsible for giving people the ""high"" feeling. Cannabidiol, or CBD, does not have the same psychoactive effect. Both are used in different levels as treatments for various conditions. Medicinal cannabis might not be a common household drug, but it's a growing business in Australia. Since 1992, 61,000 approvals for medicinal cannabis had been granted by the Therapeutic Goods Administration through the Special Access Scheme, but most of these have occurred in the past few years. Since August last year approvals have doubled, from 2878 to 5739. Between June and July this year alone, approvals rose by 20 per cent. There have been some big changes in the past four years that have helped improve access, including the introduction of medicinal cannabis clinics, improved information for prescribers and a drop in product price. Professor McGregor said that today, medicinal cannabis costs roughly 25 per cent of what it did in 2017, or about $5 to $15 per day per patient. Workers trimming cannabis plants. The flower heads will be processed for medicinal sale, and sold as flowers or an oil product.Credit:Janie Barrett The price drop has been aided by the sheer number of products now available on the Australian market, with about 150 different medicinal flower and oil products being sold by 37 companies, which are fighting for a small number of patients. ""We used to joke that there was one patient for every company in this space in Australia,"" Professor McGregor said. The TGA has also recently released an interim decision to downgrade certain medicinal cannabis products from Schedule 4 to Schedule 3, which would allow approved low-dose products to be sold over the counter at the pharmacy. But that decision is not final and Mr Cantelo, who started building the medicinal cannabis company in earnest about five years ago, is playing the long game. At the moment just one-quarter of their flower produce is sold to Australian patients while the rest is exported. Production is starting on its first commercial oil product, and he said there would be four of those in coming months. ""We’ve got four products on the market to Australian patients right now ranging from a high CBD, very low THC product right up through to a very high THC, low CBD product and two in the middle,"" he said. Most approvals were for chronic pain, a TGA spokesman said. Medicinal cannabis has also been approved for cancer pain and fibromyalgia, for managing seizures or epilepsy, to treat psychological conditions including anxiety, anorexia, insomnia or post-traumatic stress disorder, and for multiple sclerosis and other movement disorders. While the TGA spokesman said the number of approvals fluctuated from month to month, more doctors were now prescribing it. Cannabis seedlings at the secret Australian Natural Therapeutics Group facility.Credit:Janie Barrett Last year 1298 individual prescribers sent Special Access Scheme applications to the TGA. This year to date, the TGA has received applications from 1827 individuals; a 41 per cent increase. Royal Australian College of General Practitioners spokeswoman Hester Wilson said applications were increasing in part because of medicinal cannabis clinics, but GPs were increasingly seeing it as an option for longstanding patients on a case-by-case basis. ""We do need to increase the evidence around when medicinal cannabis is appropriate; and that's really not clear,"" she said. A worker on the Australian Natural Therapeutics Group farm prunes the plants.Credit:Janie Barrett ""But it is one of those situations where sometimes for us, as individual prescribers who know our patients well, that it absolutely is a choice that we can and do make in order to assist the individual patients that we're seeing."" Dr Wilson, who is also an addiction specialist, said it would only be something she would prescribe if she had been having an extended conversation about it with a patient she knew well and they were both clear about the expected outcome. ""They do need to be aware of the risks and the fact that we don't know what the benefits are,"" she said. ""So I really do take a very cautious approach."" Professor McGregor, who recently co-authored a paper comparing medicinal cannabis access around the world, said while there had been almost exponential growth in medicinal cannabis use, Australia had a long way to go. Professor McGregor said the federal government’s own statistics from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare estimated there were 600,000 people who were self-medicating with cannabis from the black market. ""[With] a liberal estimate of maybe 30,000 patients being serviced by the official scheme, then you've still got 570,000 that are unaccounted for,"" he said. ""I don't think we should be slapping ourselves on the back too firmly at this stage, we’ve still a long way to go. But the trends are certainly a lot more positive than they were.""

https://www.theage.com.au/national/nsw/nsw-looks-at-driver-monitoring-tech-for-medicinal-cannabis-users-20230331-p5cx4v.html,NSW looks at driver monitoring tech for medicinal cannabis users,"April 2, 2023 — 5.01am","We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. Legalise Cannabis NSW lead candidate Jeremy Buckingham, who is close to winning a seat in the NSW upper house, is calling for trials to measure driver impairment to ensure those prescribed medicinal cannabis aren’t discriminated against for taking their medication. One trial may include using driver monitoring technology, which assesses a driver’s fatigue and distraction by scanning the face and eyes. Currently, it is against the law in NSW for a person to drive with any amount of THC – a psychoactive component of cannabis – present in their body, even if it is prescribed. THC causes impairment for anywhere between two and eight hours but can show up in roadside drug tests for up to three days. Other prescription drugs do not show up in roadside testing. Richard Francis sources his cannabis from Astrid Dispensary and believes the drug driving laws are unfair. Credit:Natalie Grono “[Driving law reform] will be the first cab off the rank,” Buckingham said. “It’s a massive disincentive for people to take the medicine that they legally can take when they’re not driving impaired in any way, shape, or form, and it’s a massive disincentive for doctors to prescribe it.” Founding chair of Swinburne University’s working group for Driver Monitoring Systems, Amie Hayley, said it was difficult to infer impairment by the presence of THC in saliva. Experimental research, she said, has shown that patients don’t display driving impairment that would usually be associated with recreational cannabis use. “[Research] is disentangling the idea that the presence of THC is automatically correlated to impairment,” she said. Her research has been looking at how eye-tracking technology in cars, known as a Driver Monitoring Systems, could be used to monitor the impact of different drugs and different dosages, to see when someone may be impaired versus just having the drugs in their system. Driver Monitoring Systems will be made mandatory in vehicles sold in the European Union from 2024. The technology alerts the driver when their blinking patterns, eye movements and head positions change. If the monitoring system senses someone has fallen unconscious, the car will slow and pull over, with emergency services notified. The number of people accessing medicinal cannabis has grown exponentially since it was legalised in 2016 with more than 345,000 Australians approved to use the medicine but head of patient advocacy and engagement at Astrid Cannabis Dispensary in Byron Bay said the driving laws were deterring people from accessing their medication. “We see it on a weekly basis,” she said. Astrid Dispensary has gained 18,000 cannabis patients in the two years since it opened. “We get patients whose entire livelihood is dependent on using their medication and being able to drive ... It’s impacted patients from being able to maintain their employment. That loss of income has a domino effect,” she said, which is especially hard for patients using cannabis for psychological conditions. Head of Patient Advocacy and Engagement Bee Mohamed said education and consultancy are important for new cannabis users. Credit:Natalie Grono It was an incredibly tough period for Michael, who lives in Sydney and asked for his surname to be withheld, when he had his licence suspended for six months in 2021 after THC showed up in a roadside drug test. He has been prescribed cannabis for PTSD, anxiety, insomnia and chronic back pain and had smoked THC cannabis about eight hours before driving. Michael said he was in no way impaired and was following his doctors’ directions. “The impact was substantial. I [have] extreme family emergencies 24/7 and not having a licence just removes you from being able to do all the things that are necessary,” he said. “It’s unfair.” Byron Bay resident Richard Francis, who is prescribed medicinal cannabis for anxiety, said he’s confident using his prescribed medication and driving – but fears undergoing roadside drug tests. “People are allowed to have two standard drinks and drive, yet I’m not allowed to take my prescribed medicine?” he said. Melbourne-based mother-of-two Alice Davy uses CBD oil during the day and THC at night to help with multiple sclerosis and stage four endometriosis. By the time she wakes up to drive her children to school, she said, she’s “not impaired at all”. Mother-of-two Alice Davy said she feels safer driving while using prescription cannabis than other pharmaceuticals.  Before being prescribed cannabis, she wouldn’t drive because of the range of pharmaceuticals she was taking. “I’m more worried about getting in the car days after taking valium because you wake up foggy,” she said. Now, she drives between Melbourne and regional NSW to visit family and seek MS treatment. “That wouldn’t have been possible on all the other drugs,” she said. “Changing these laws is a no-brainer.” Former Lismore magistrate David Heilpern said NSW’s hard stance on drug driving had done nothing to decrease road deaths. He stepped down from the courts in 2020 in protest of the cannabis drug driving laws. In 2019, NSW police were given the power to impose a three-month licence suspension on anyone with THC in their system, along with a fine of $587. “Why should we even think for a moment that we need a special rule just because the drug was once an illicit drug?” he said. “There’s no reason for it to be specially treated.” But acting deputy secretary for safety, environment and regulation at Transport for NSW Sally Webb said the laws were necessary to protect other drivers. “THC can affect cognitive and motor skills necessary for safe driving, such as attention, judgment, memory, vision and co-ordination,” she said. “These rules are in place to discourage people from driving when they are under influence to reduce the risk of a fatal crash and maintain the safety of all road users.” Webb said the department was continuing “to monitor developments in vehicle technologies that support road safety, including the Driver Monitoring System technology”. The NSW government is monitoring drug-driving research and developments relevant to drug-driving policy as part of the 2026 Road Safety Action Plan. Copyright © 2023",10,1018

This was published 7 years ago Medicinal cannabis could be legally grown and prescribed to patients as early as next year under a cross party bill that has attracted initial support from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Greens leader, senator Richard Di Natale, announced on Monday that the bill to create a regulator for medicinal cannabis for certain conditions had been drafted and would be put before the Senate for a vote in November. While Victoria and NSW state governments had indicated that they wanted to legalise medicinal cannabis, a federal regulatory scheme was required to do this: ""We need national laws to make sure we can licence growers … that doctors can prescribe this and that the medication gets in the hands of patients who need it."" If passed, there was ""no reason"" Australia could not begin importing medicinal cannabis and make it available for patients next year, ahead of creating a locally grown industry for the drug. Medicinal cannabis my soon be legalised in Australia.Credit:Max Mason Hubers The drug could be prescribed for certain conditions where there was ""overwhelming evidence"" of its effectiveness, including stopping muscle spasms from multiple sclerosis, and as an appetite stimulant for some terminal illnesses. States and territories that opted in to the regulatory scheme would be required to amend their respective criminal laws to exclude medicinal cannabis. The move follows a Senate committee in August giving its unanimous endorsement for the bill - which was introduced into Parliament last November.  Coalition senator Ian MacDonald, who chaired the committee, said Mr Turnbull and Health Minister Sussan Ley ""are totally supportive to the concept"" of legalising medicinal cannabis. Federal Greens leader Richard Di Natale.Credit:Chris Hopkins While the Department of Health still had concerns over ""technical details"" in the proposed law, he said: ""We must get a resolution which provides this relief at the soonest possible time."" Health Minister Sussan Ley said the Turnbull government was ""incredibly sympathetic"" to the plight of those suffering chronic pain and illnesses ""and we want to ensure they get access to the most effective medical treatments available"". Asked whether she supported the proposed bill to legalise medicinal cannabis, Ms Ley said she would consider the Senate committee's recommendations and continue to discuss them with her parliamentary colleagues. ""We must ensure any therapeutic product, including medicinal cannabis, is not only a safe and effective treatment for public use, but also meets our strict international obligations safe-guarding its manufacture and distribution for medical purposes only,"" she said. Labor senator Anne Urquhart, who will co-sponsor the bill, said people were already risking criminal charges to use the drug: ""We still need to trial some of these substances and [also] make sure that people are safe from criminality and that we have a safe, effective and affordable system where people can access medicinal cannabis."" Their comments were echoed by Liberal senator Sharman Stone, Labor senator Melissa Parke and Liberal Democrat senator David Leyonhjelm. Lucy Haslam, a key campaigner for the legalisation of medical marijuana said on Monday there were existing overseas regulation models that could be drawn on without delay. ""We've got to get past the rhetoric and fallacies … that have surrounded medicinal cannabis for so many years,"" she said. Ms Haslam's son, Dan, used medical cannabis to relieve the nausea and vomiting he experienced as he underwent chemotherapy. Mr Haslam, 25, died earlier this year. ""This is what the Australian people need. They needed it yesterday. It's too late for my son but it's not too late for thousands of others in Australia."" Senator Di Natale said that they had not worked out how much it would cost to establish a regulator. They were continuing to draft the bill to ensure the regulatory scheme complied with Australia's obligations under international treaties. Follow us on Twitter Copyright © 2023",8,651

Ms Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting was the cornerstone in a $27.2 million capital raising by WA’s Little Green Pharma for the purchase of an existing cultivation and manufacturing site in regional Denmark which already has European licences for creating medical products. Iron ore magnate Gina Rinehart’s company Hancock Prospecting is getting into pot stocks. Credit:WAtoday Hancock Prospecting gets a 10 per cent stake in Little Green Pharma out of the deal, which was announced on Tuesday to the ASX. The purchase of the facility brings forward Little Green Pharma’s expansion plans into Europe by two years and will see its annual cultivation capacity go up immediately from three tonnes of biomass at its existing West Australian facility to a total of 23 tonnes of which 12 tonnes is dried cannabis flower. The blooming medicinal cannabis industry is highly regulated internationally but Little Green Pharma, founded in 2016, has managed to sell products in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, New Zealand, and Brazil. The Perth company also recently announced a Polish distribution partner. Medicinal cannabis industry researcher FreshLeaf Analytics has projected Australian revenue from medicinal cannabis would double in 2021, compared to last year, to $200 million. Hancock Prospecting business development general manager Dan Wade said the company wanted to help thousands of Australians and overseas patients access cannabis medicines. “We believe medicinal cannabis has a vital role in helping to treat a range of chronic conditions, and we’re pleased to support an Australian medicinal cannabis company in Little Green Pharma that continues to put patients first and contribute to the development of this helpful and emerging industry,” he said. Little Green Pharma managing director Fleta Solomon said it was well positioned to capitalise on its brand equity in Europe and Australia with the new facility. “The Denmark facility provides more than eight times the capacity of our previous planned production expansion,” she said. “Purchasing the Denmark facility provides both cost and time savings and was a preferable option to building out production capacity at our existing facility. “We’ll keep our foot on our Australian property for longer term growth but are now able to redeploy the significant capex investment we had planned.” Medicinal cannabis is riding on a high but Ms Rinehart’s coal mining dreams in Canada have taken a hit after environmental regulators recommended the Trudeau government put a halt to the proposal for the Grassy Mountain open-cut mine in Alberta. The flagship project of Riversdale Resources, a company taken over by Hancock Prospecting in 2019 for more than $600 million, would produce about 93 million tonnes of coal over a 23-year mine life and have a 1521 hectare footprint. About 500 jobs would be created during construction of the project and 385 full-time jobs in production. A joint review panel acting on behalf of the Alberta Energy Regulator has denied permit applications related to the mine under provincial law and recommended to Canada’s environment minister on Thursday that the project should not go ahead. Alberta Energy Regulator chief executive Laurie Pushor said the panel’s decision reflected the regulator’s commitment to making evidence-based and risk-informed decisions in the public interest. The final report from the panel stated there would have a significant impact on the environment and the traditional activities of Indigenous people. “Based on our assessment, we conclude that the project is likely to result in significant adverseenvironmental effects on surface water quality, westslope cutthroat trout and their habitat, whitebark pine, rough fescue grasslands, and vegetation species and community biodiversity,” it said. “We also find that the project is likely to contribute to existing significant adverse cumulative environmental effects on westslope cutthroat trout, little brown bats, grizzly bears, and whitebark pine. “We find that the project would result in low to moderate positive economic impacts on the regionaleconomy.” The company is exploring its legal options.

It will have double perimeter fences, 24 hour CCTV and a range of other security measures, including a vault where finished products will be stored. ""It will be very, very secure,"" said Cannvalate chief executive Sud Agarwal. Under licensing requirements, the plant's address cannot be disclosed but it will be in close proximity to cannabis cultivation sites. ""It's going to be the biggest manufacturing plant in Australia, probably by a factor of at least five times. So it's going to completely change the dynamic of cannabis extraction and cannabis manufacturing,"" Dr Agarwal said. New figures from Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration show that demand for medicinal cannabis prescriptions hit 3378 in April, which is more than triple the total in April last year of 1108. Dr Agarwal said Australia was the fourth largest medicinal cannabis market in the world behind the US, Canada and Germany. However, the vast majority of medicinal cannabis currently used in Australia is imported. ""Probably 95 per cent plus of all the stuff that's getting given to Australian patients, is imported from Canada or Europe,"" Mr Agarwal said. Construction on the facility is expected to start before September, with completion scheduled for the middle of 2021. Cannvalate, which has flagged plans to list on the ASX, has also signed a five-year distribution agreement with Valens. The Canadian company confirmed its plans to enter the local market this month, describing Australia as ""the second largest cannabis market outside of North America"". It’s going to completely change the dynamic of cannabis extraction and cannabis manufacturing.

It definitely has a role to play and that level of investment will be significant,"" he said.

This was published 2 years ago Medicinal cannabis could be available over-the-counter in Australia by next year as the national medicines regulator weighs a proposal to allow it to be sold without a prescription, but some experts warn the approach could backfire. New research published in the International Journal of Drug Policy suggests the Therapeutic Goods Administration's plan to allow chemists to sell a month's worth of cannabidiol at a maximum dose of 60mg per day is unlikely to benefit patients - who were likely to ""self medicate"" instead. Medicinal cannabis could be sold over the counter without a prescription, but experts warn the dose could be too low to be effective.Credit:Stuart Layt The paper's co-author Professor Iain McGregor, academic director of Sydney University's Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics, said much higher doses were needed to give relief to patients with chronic pain, insomnia, anxiety and epilepsy. ""There is no good quality evidence that 60mg does anything useful,"" Professor McGregor said. The TGA last week released an interim decision to amend the Poisons Standard to allow cannabidiol to be sold over the counter at the restricted dose to adults, inviting public comment until October 13 with a final decision due in late November and implementation in February. Professor McGregor warned that without appropriate dosing, thousands of such patients may instead continue ""self medicating"" with illicit use of cannabis, which unlike cannabidiol products contains tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) - the psychoactive compound that gets users high. Whether they smoked cannabis or bought cannabidiol products on the black market, he said, ""these people may just bypass the medical profession."" There was ""very good evidence"" in scientific research that 300 to 400mg of cannabidiol was effective at treating anxiety, he said, and ""reasonable"" evidence that this dose could effectively treat insomnia and chronic pain. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-intoxicating component of the hemp plant. Currently, patients who want to use CBD products have to find a doctor who is familiar with the process of applying through the TGA's special access scheme to legally prescribe them. About 10,000 Australians adults were accessing the drug through this channel, Professor McGregor said, while an estimated 600,000 ""may be self-medicating a medical condition with cannabis."" While some patients might purposely exceed the 60mg dose, he said, this would mean a pack would only last four to five days and the other ingredients may cause side effects. Greens Senator Rachel Siewert said cannabis was ""a unique product that needs unique independent regulation"", calling for a new body to be established to regulate medicinal cannabis products outside of the TGA. ""If ineffective doses are supplied to consumers, it will diminish confidence in the product,"" Senator Siewert said. The report of a Senate inquiry into barriers to patient access to medicinal cannabis in Australia in March found that allowing those products containing low-dose cannabidiol with ""very low levels"" of psychoactive compounds to be sold over-the-counter ""would greatly increase the accessibility of these products for patients."" ""It would also bring Australia closer in line with models of access in countries such as the United Kingdom and Canada,"" the report said. The World Health Organisation's expert committee on drug dependence recommended in 2018 that pure cannabidiol (CBD) products not be placed under international drug control ""as the substance was not found to have psychoactive properties, and presents no potential for abuse or dependence.""

Penalties for drug-driving include mandatory licence suspension. Premier Daniel Andrews in Box Hill on Tuesday. Credit:Joe Armao Andrews said on Tuesday that allowing unimpaired Victorians to drive after taking medicinal cannabis was a significant priority for his government. “In terms of drug law reform, the issue that I’m much more focused on is those Victorians – and there can be as many as 200,000 – who are currently using medicinal cannabis with a script from a doctor and they cannot drive,” he said at a press conference at Box Hill High School. “That’s an issue that’s bedevilled us. We need to find a way through that.” The premier said he didn’t want anyone to avoid alleviating pain or other symptoms because they were too scared to take what had been prescribed to them. “I don’t want them to feel they can’t access that care because we don’t have [updated] drug-driving laws and we don’t have a test that can test for impairment,” he said. “You’re either positive [to traces of the psychoactive tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC] or negative. It’s a binary thing when you may not be impaired at all. So we’re working through that.” Changing the rules around medicinal cannabis use and driving was canvassed during the last term of parliament, but never eventuated. The Legalise Cannabis Party – which alongside the Greens holds the balance of power in the upper house on legislation that the Coalition and right-wing crossbenchers oppose – has a bill before the Legislative Council on the issue. David Ettershank from the Legalise Cannabis Party has welcomed the premier’s comments.Credit:Paul Jeffers It seeks to treat medicinal cannabis like other prescription medications when it comes to driving. In other words, it would allow people to drive if they are not impaired. Victoria became the first state to approve medicinal cannabis in 2016. Unlike in Tasmania, there is no exemption for unimpaired drivers. David Ettershank, one of two upper house MPs from Legalise Cannabis, said he welcomed the premier’s comments. “Legalise Cannabis Victoria is currently having discussions with a number of government ministers about this and other questions,” he said. The party’s bill is scheduled for debate next Wednesday. Cannabis has two main chemical components. THC is the psychoactive ingredient, responsible for giving people the “high” feeling. Cannabidiol, or CBD, does not have the same psychoactive effect. Both are used in different levels as treatments for various conditions, including cancer-related symptoms, anxiety and neurological disorders.

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 3 years ago A medicinal cannabis farm has been declared open for business in south-east Queensland, with the race on to supply the product to the Australian market. Medifarm’s multimillion-dollar facility, in a top-secret location in the Sunshine Coast hinterland, has been officially opened by federal Health Minister Greg Hunt, who visited the site on Tuesday. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt surrounded by rows of cannabis.Credit:Darren England/AAP Mr Hunt said Medifarm had been granted three of the 81 licences so far issued by the federal government to grow cannabis for medicinal purposes. Medifarm had announced late last year it would produce medicinal cannabis commercially in the first half of 2019, but Mr Hunt said regulations had slowed the process. “The office of drug control has responsibility for that and they are very, very assiduous and one of the things everybody would want is for us to operate in an efficient way but in a safe way,” he said. “It is a highly regulated sector and we make no apologies for that, but it’s about ensuring that if the doctors determine the medicine should be available, it can be available.” Medifarm founder Adam Benjamin said he was not worried about the delay, but admitted there was a lot of competition in the market as more companies entered the fledgling sector. “We are a proud frontrunner in this space,” Mr Benjamin said. “As for the other 78 licences, good on them, people often ask is it competitive, well, if you can be in the race to supply life-changing medicine to Aussie patients, what an amazing race.” Mr Benjamin said they would be supplying products to local doctors before the end of the year. “We have already two harvests out of the four or five growth cycles that can happen in a year,” he said. “It’s very important to maintain supply in the future to patients that we build up our reserves, we have a huge amount that we’re building up so as we come to market our supply chain is continuous and the quality is continuous.” Medifarm founding director Adam Benjamin.Credit:Darren England/AAP Mr Benjamin said he founded the company after learning of the plight of eight-year-old Sam Martin, whose parents, Mark and Tanya, fought to have their son put on medicinal cannabis to ease the pain of late-stage aggressive cancer. Mr Benjamin is a family friend of the Martins, who were on hand on Tuesday for Medifarm’s official opening. Mark Martin said it was a big leap forward for patients. “We’ve seen first-hand as a family what a massive benefit medicinal cannabis can have for patients in terms of pain management,” he said. “When we started to give Sam medicinal cannabis in 2014 in the last phase of his life his general wellbeing improved massively.” Testing of medicinal cannabis has not been as thorough as other types of pharmaceuticals as a result of the intense governmental regulation on the product, however preliminary trials have shown it to be effective as a pain reliever and to help lessen the effects of conditions such as epilepsy. Medifarm has produced 1.2 tonnes of cannabis so far, with an annual capacity to provide medicine to about 3000 patients. Up until now, Australian doctors could prescribe medicinal cannabis but had to source it from overseas, however Medifarm and a number of other facilities are either ready to begin local production or nearing that stage. More than 12,000 prescriptions have been written for medicinal cannabis nation-wide since it was made legal by the federal government in 2016 and by most of the states and territories shortly after. Medifarm has set itself up as a complete supply chain - growing and processing the cannabis itself, and then also producing the medicines from it for sale. It has sourced its cannabis plants from Israel, which is further along in its medicinal cannabis industry, with the Sunshine Coast facility employing 40 people. Copyright © 2023",7,673

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 8 years ago The debate about medicinal cannabis in Australia has fallen into a deep hole. In 2003 and again in 2014, NSW Premiers proposed legalising medicinal cannabis. In 2003 they were prevented from proceeding by their political parties. In 2014, NSW Premier Mike Baird has instead announced a medicinal cannabis ""trial"", and COAG Health Ministers then agreed to support this trial. What's more, any political willingness to consider medicinal cannabis seems confined to ""terminally ill"" patients. This is nonsense and illustrates the inevitable problems with a politics-based approach rather than expert appraisal of the evidence. Lou and Lucy Haslam (left and second from right) are spearheading a campaign to have cannabis legalised for terminally ill patients, like their son Dan (second from left). The push also has the support of Dan's wife Alyce (right).Credit:Geoff O'Neill Politicians and the Australian Medical Association alike proclaim that ""more research is needed"". Of course it is – but in saying this they are deliberately or naively dismissing the already available robust supportive evidence. Police Superintendent Clint Pheeney said recently that Tamworth police were not to charge the Haslam family for providing medicinal cannabis to their 24-year-old son with advanced bowel cancer.  Recently a NSW judge upheld an appeal against a 12-month prison sentence imposed  for supplying medicinal cannabis. Some law enforcement officials now seem reluctant to charge or imprison people providing or using cannabis for medicinal purposes. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Tony Abbott  clearly supports medicinal cannabis. Many Australians already use cannabis medicinally, albeit illegally, especially for chronic pain.Credit:Max Mason-Hubers Public opinion strongly supports medicinal cannabis and has for some time. The Haslam family's change.org petition to ""decriminalise the use of medicinal cannabis for people with terminal cancer"" has attracted some 200,000 signatures.  The upshot from this is the Inaugural Australian Medicinal Cannabis Symposium to be held in Tamworth next Friday and Saturday, with the purpose of further informing Australian professionals and the public about medicinal cannabis. As in other countries, many Australians already use cannabis medicinally, albeit illegally, especially for chronic pain. Medical opinion is divided. Some experts claim the evidence is weak and the risks unacceptably high. Both claims defy the evidence. We and others argue that cannabis is a useful second line medication to relieve distressing symptoms when conventional treatments haven't worked. Over 100 research trials have been published on medicinal cannabis, the vast majority being supportive. We argue that this is substantial evidence. We also argue that the evidence of side effects shows these as modest, especially compared to many conventional medications. In a recent SBS Insight program, some participants argued that cannabis is a natural plant with multiple curative properties. As yet, this is overreaching. Young children with intractable epilepsy present a real dilemma. Rigorous studies evaluating cannabis for childhood epilepsy have not been published. Nevertheless, who can ignore the impressive anecdotal evidence their desperate parents provide? Regardless of the evidence and despite illegality, many patients find that cannabis helps them manage their medical conditions or the side-effects of medications used for their conditions. In a recent ABC Health Report, Professor Michael Farrell argued that the evidence on medicinal cannabis for chronic pain is weak, partly because pain is only subjective. Pain management is not only very meaningful to the individual patient, it also affects the extent to which patients and their carers can lead more functional lives: medicinal cannabis has been found to help such patients and their carers. Some opponents argue that if Australia legalises medicinal cannabis then it should only be with proprietary pharmaceutical cannabis medicines. Although several have been used overseas for decades, none is readily available in Australia. Often these are unpredictably absorbed, and many patients consider them less effective than (smoked) plant cannabis. Western medicine has evolved from using plants and plant extracts into pure, mainly synthetic, medicines. Generally, this makes good sense. But with cannabis, some evidence suggests the whole is more effective than individual components. Besides, the proprietary pharmaceutical cannabis medicines are very expensive, and thus many patients who need them cannot afford them. These days, patients can heat plant cannabis and inhale the vapour rather than inhale the smoke from the burning plant. Some opponents argue that conventional medicines are more effective and safer than cannabis. This is not necessarily true. Sometimes they don't work or may have unacceptable side effects. Nausea following cancer chemotherapy is an example of a very distressing condition where conventional medicines often don't work. Why can't we allow medicinal cannabis to comfort people under these circumstances? Several studies show that medicinal cannabis does not increase the risk of recreational cannabis use. A recent study suggests medicinal cannabis may reduce the risk of overdose deaths from prescription opioids by 25%. Some opponents claim that the health risks of cannabis are very serious. How can this be when about 2.5-5% of the world's population use recreational cannabis but this use is estimated to account for only one-thousandth of the global burden of illness? In short, it's a mess. Some states and the ACT are conducting yet more inquiries, when clearly a national approach is what's required. Can we accept a solution reliant on state police and judges being reluctant to enforce the laws? Some politicians are happy to start now, others are determined to block any action. Health experts are divided. The net result is that cannabis is now being used widely in Australia but without quality control or regulation. It's just not good enough.

Member for Buderim Steve Dickson said he believed the Sunshine Coast provided the perfect environmental conditions to be a leader in growing and manufacturing medicinal cannabis in Australia. The economic benefits of medicinal marijuana have been examined, with new laws passing Queensland parliament.Credit:AP It comes as legislation to allow patients to access medicinal cannabis was passed on Wednesday night. The Public Health (Medicinal Cannabis) Bill 2016 provides a pathway for Queensland patients of any age and with a range of conditions to access legal medicinal cannabis products. But Mr Dickson told parliament he did not agree that the government should be responsible for obtaining a licence to cultivate and manufacture medicinal cannabis. The committee that examined the bill recommended that the Queensland government ""prioritise its investigation of options for obtaining a licence to cultivate and manufacture medicinal cannabis in Queensland"".  ""I am sure there is enough interest from the private sector to cultivate and manufacture cannabis in Queensland,"" Mr Dickson said. Mr Dickson told parliament he wrote to every state MP seeking their support to ensure patients have access to medicinal cannabis in 2015. ""I was appalled to learn in 2015, and still now in 2016, Queenslanders have to turn to black market options to find relief from a range of debilitating and life-threatening conditions,"" Mr Dickson said. Health Minister Cameron Dick said the cultivation and manufacture of medicinal cannabis products in Queensland offered the potential to improve patient access to the products and create agricultural and business opportunities for the state. ""This is an industry with real potential and one I consider we should promote in Queensland,"" Mr Dick said. ""We hope that as this industry develops locally a range of medicinal cannabis products will become available at affordable prices"".  Member for Gaven Sid Cramp also pointed out the ""real opportunity for Queensland to not only supply medicinal cannabis for our state, but also provide it for national and international markets for any countries seeking this product"". While member for Toowoomba South David Janetzki said a ""small but tightly controlled Queensland industry that would bring about opportunities for primary producers and regional communities is possible"". He pointed to a Sydney University Business School study that stated that legalising medicinal cannabis in Australia may build an industry worth $150 million per year. Member for Nudgee Leanne Linard told parliament that eight years ago, while caring for her mother, who was suffering with wasting and acute pain from late stage ovarian cancer, her mother read about the potential benefits of medicinal cannabis in providing palliative relief. ""She, like many cancer sufferers and palliative care patients, was on a significant dose of schedule 8 drugs, which did not for her adequately mask her pain and resultantly she suffered,"" Ms Linard said. ""I do not know if medicinal cannabis would have brought her some relief.  ""She did not have the opportunity to benefit from the bill before the House, but I hope others will.""

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 1 year ago A worker sacked after failing a drug test, because he was taking medicinal cannabis prescribed by his doctor, is taking his former employer to court. Mitchell Rice, 26, has launched a claim against Queensland Rail in the NSW Federal Circuit Court alleging QR dismissed him and discriminated against him in contravention of the Fair Work Act. Mitchell Rice has been his family’s sole earner since his mother died in February. He had worked as a support maintainer for the state transit authority since July 9 last year and his last day in the job was August 16, 2021. Mr Rice is seeking $91,750 plus interest in economic loss, and a lump sum of $150,000 for distress. In December 2020, Mr Rice began suffering from anxiety and sleep deprivation caused by his shift work and his mother’s declining health after she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He was the main carer for his mother. His brother suffers from mental disabilities and does not work, and his father had been on a disability pension. According to court documents, later that month, Mr Rice was prescribed medicinal cannabis, specifically THC Flower Relax Daylesford Bud, by his treating physician Daniel Van Dijk. Dr Van Dijk advised Mr Rice to not take the medication within eight hours of starting work, to ensure he was not impaired. Mr Rice emailed a supervisor at his Geebung depot a notice of him being prescribed the medicinal cannabis. Less than three weeks later, he was placed on light duties, court documents said. The applicant - Mitchell Rice. On 21 January 2021, Mr Rice was advised that QR’s chief medical officer had deemed him temporarily unfit for work and he was stood down with pay. In February 2021, Mr Rice’s mother died. As a result, her life insurance and superannuation fund payments ceased, leaving Mr Rice as the sole financial earner for his family. Mr Rice contacted QR on February 25 expressing his desire to return to work and offering to refrain from taking his medication. He returned to work soon after. On June 1, Mr Rice was subject to a random drug test. He declared he had taken started taking his medication again and had a dose two nights earlier. This was allegedly not noted on his form. His test results came back positive for tetrahydrocannabinol, a main component in cannabis. That day, he received a letter from QR suspending him, according to court documents. On August 16, Mr Rice received a termination notice. Mr Rice’s solicitor Jeremy Kennedy, who has taken on the case pro bono, said he was not aware of any similar cases and believed this would be a test case for future claims. “The evidence is that providing the drug like any prescription, there is no impairment at work,” he said. “This drug has some prejudices and social stigma. “We think this is a social issue that needs to be determined by the courts to try to change employers’ views on this drug and how it should be used and considered in the workplace.” Mr Kennedy said by the time the case comes to a head, Mr Rice could have suffered a year or two of economic loss and be entitled to $200,000 or more in compensation, plus damages. A QR spokeswoman said in a statement that because the matter was before the courts, there was limited comment that could be made on the case. “Safety is Queensland Rail’s number one priority, with all employees and contractors required to be fit for work at all times while on duty,” it read. “This includes having a blood alcohol concentration reading of zero and a level of other drugs under the target concentration level as outlined in the Australian standard.” The case will be heard in court for the first time on Tuesday.

Bethany was 18 months old when she was first diagnosed with epilepsy.  Now four, she suffers from night-time seizures and associated speech and learning difficulties.  ""It's a constant struggle,"" said Bethany's mother, Karen Edwards. Parents hold out for medical cannabis trial: Bethany Edwards plays at home with younger sister Lara.Credit:Brendan Esposito As protocols are being drawn up for the clinical trial of medical cannabis to treat children with severe epilepsy, Karen and Brian Edwards are anxiously waiting to see if Bethany will be included when the trial starts next year.  ""[Epilepsy] affects so many aspects of everyday life,"" Mrs Edwards said. ""Even just going on a holiday, we have to stick to major cities so if Bethany does have a seizure, there's a hospital that can deal with that.""  ""Epilepsy affects so many aspects of everyday life.""Credit:Brendan Esposito The clinical trial will be the first of its kind in Australia and part of a handful of similar studies carried out worldwide.  Dr John Lawson, paediatric neurologist at Sydney Children's Hospital and a principal investigator on the trial, said that up to 200 children from as young as six months of age may be included.  Those enrolled will be at the severe end of the epilepsy spectrum, and at least a couple of standard medications will have to have failed to help them.  Mrs Edwards said Bethany's neurologist at The Children's Hospital at Westmead would be putting Bethany's name forward to be included in the trial, but there was no guarantee she would get in.  And if she doesn't? ""I'd be gutted,"" Mrs Edwards said. ""She's four, you feel like you're her voice, you have to fight for them and get them the best."" Some parents have been unable to wait for a trial, sourcing medical marijuana illegally, usually in desperate attempts to ease their children's suffering.  But Dr Lawson said a trial was essential to look at the safety and efficacy of the product.  ""You hear a few commentators, even medical experts, saying we don't need trials, but they're talking about adults. ""We're talking about very young children, we need to know the safety and families are asking for that."" The medicinal cannabis will be in the form of a tincture or edible product.  Unlike street marijuana, which contains high levels of the chemical compound THC, the oil extract used in the trial will have high levels of cannabidiol or CBD, and low levels of THC.  This maximises the anti-seizure potential and decreases the risk of mind-altering psychoactive effects, Dr Lawson said. Mrs Edwards agrees that a trial is necessary to ensure the treatment is safe, but would trade Bethany's seizures and her medication side effects for the main side effects of medical marijuana – fatigue and drowsiness – any day.  ""Every time I give her her medication I feel like I'm poisoning her in a way because I know the side effects.""  Bethany is on an anti-epileptic and a steroid medication, and is already suffering the adverse effects of the steroid, with weight gain, mood changes, insomnia and a weakened immune system.    ""The steroids really affect her ability to cope emotionally, so she'll have a big meltdown and people walk past and you hear, 'She needs a good slap' kind of comments and it's like, 'You don't know what's going on'. ""Just because she's not in a wheelchair … it's a disability that you can't see,"" Mrs Edwards said.    Mrs Edwards hopes medicinal cannabis may control Bethany's seizures to the extent that she could come off her other medications.  But Dr Lawson is cautioning against parents expecting miracle cures.  ""The best estimates at the moment are maybe one-third will benefit and even in those who benefit, it's not necessarily a miracle – their seizures might be reduced,"" he said. For the Edwards, there's a chance the trial could mean a more ""normal"" life for Bethany and a better start at school next year.

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 10 months ago Queensland accounts for more than half the medicinal cannabis prescriptions dispensed since it was made legal in 2016, new research shows, but other states are now expected to close the gap. A major study led by researchers at the University of Sydney has, for the first time, examined all the medicinal cannabis prescriptions issued since 2016, when the national scheme began, to late 2021. The medicinal cannabis industry in Australia was estimated to be worth $51.8 million in 2021.Credit:Stuart Layt Senior author Dr Elizabeth Cairns said the rate of prescriptions was slow in the weeks and months after the therapies were legalised, but increased significantly after that. “It was initially quite slow, but the significant rise in the past few years has been quite astonishing,” she said. “The data was only on prescriptions, not whether the treatment was effective, but even so, to see these prescribing patterns I think is very informative.” Almost 250,000 scripts have been approved for Australians since 2016, with 51 per cent of those issued in Queensland. Study co-author Associate Professor Vicki Kotsirilos, from Western Sydney University, who is also a GP who prescribes medicinal cannabis products, said while the data did not show exactly why Queensland was so far ahead, she could make an educated guess. “I suspect it could be because of the way the permit system is set up in Queensland. It is easier to prescribe these therapies [there] than in other states,” she said. “However, in the past two months, Victoria and NSW followed the same permit system as Queensland, so it’s possible we will see the rates of prescriptions in those states also rise.” The vast majority of medicinal cannabis prescriptions (61 per cent) were for pain management, which Kotsirilos said did not surprise her as the body of evidence on cannabis therapies was strongest for that use compared with other conditions, albeit still with weak evidence overall. “It’s not a magic bullet. It does take a more holistic approach to treat pain conditions, but for some people, there is enough benefit that it can improve their quality of life,” she said. “For others, it might be a major benefit, and we never know who those patients might be, it’s just through trial and error.” Anxiety was the second most common reason for a prescription, at 16 per cent, followed by sleep disorders at 5.7 per cent. A total of 140 conditions were listed as reasons for a script. Doctors in Australia can prescribe a range of cannabis products, from oils and tablets to cannabis “flowers”, which would be smoked. Products derived from cannabis contain either the compound CBD, or CBD and THC, which is the chemical that produces a “high” when the drug is used recreationally. “CBD is a schedule 4 product and THC is schedule 8 [more highly regulated],” Cairns said. “In general, the S4 prescribing was much lower than the S8 prescribing, but that seems to be because there are more S8 products around, especially given that all the flower products contain THC.” Before 2020, people aged 45 to 52 had the highest rate of prescriptions, however that later shifted to those aged 20 to 31. The researchers did not know the reason for the shift, but said it was interesting that it coincided with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The efficacy of cannabis products, or cannabis itself, to treat a range of conditions is still very much under review, with researchers around the world gathering data. However, official organisations such as the Australian Faculty of Pain Medicine still do not recommend their use. Kotsirilos said this research did not look at efficacy but gave a good roadmap to what areas should be the focus of research in future. The study used data from the Therapeutic Goods Administration, which has kept a record of every medicinal cannabis prescription issued in Australia since 2016. The research has been published in the journal Frontiers in Pharmacology. Copyright © 2023",7,682

Credit:Sylvia Liber She was suffering from arthritis and glaucoma, had lost her appetite and was experiencing fitful sleep. For Mr Lawrence, a cancer survivor who two years ago ditched legal painkillers in preference of medicinal cannabis, the remedy was obvious. ""My friends were sceptical but the results were clear. Ellie had been hobbling around, not eating or sleeping, but after starting her on cannabis oil 12 months ago she was back running up and down the backyard, her appetite had returned and she was sleeping much better."" Mr Lawrence said the oil he administers to his beloved pet did not contain the psycho-active compound tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), yet did retain cannabidiol (CBD) which he believed had therapeutic benefits. This month NSW Premier Mike Baird and Minister for Medical Research Pru Goward announced that, in an Australian first, children with severe treatment-resistant epilepsy would be provided with compassionate access to a cannabis-based medicine made of pure CBD. In announcing the scheme at Sydney Children's Hospital on July 5, Ms Goward said the government recognised the potential of such medicines, particularly for people who had exhausted conventional treatment options. ""We have embarked on an ambitious research program to explore the possible therapeutic benefits of cannabinoids for patients suffering from a range of debilitating conditions,"" Ms Goward said. Legal access to medicinal cannabis can not come quick enough for Mr Lawrence.  Diagnosed with a rare spinal tumour in 2010; he had three vertabrae removed during a 43-hour operation. Five of his ribs, a leg bone and 60 pieces of titanium were used to rebuild his spine. Legal painkillers did not curb his chronic pain and caused serious side effects. ""What I'm doing to treat myself for ongoing pain - and my dog - is legal in several countries around the world, but not Australia,"" he said. ""We don't need more research, more trials - we need action. It's great medicinal cannabis is being made available for some kids with severe epilepsy but I don't see much compassion when terminally ill patients and others in chronic pain are not allowed access. It's not about smoking pot and getting stoned - it's about ingesting it to get some pain relief."" In the US, doggie treats containing cannabis compounds are marketed to owners of ailing and elderly animals as pain relievers. However it's important to note that the Australian Veterinary Association does not recommend the administration of cannabis oil to dogs. ""Anyone who is concerned about their older pet should contact their local veterinarian to discuss the best management plan,"" AVA member Paula Parker said. Specifically Dr Parker warned against the use of products containing THC, which she said would be dangerous for pets. ""THC causes a neurological depressant effect in dogs similar to people,"" she said. ""Owing to their smaller body size, this can lead to dangerous levels of depression of heart and lung function, especially where the compound has been concentrated in oil or butter form.

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 3 years ago There is not currently enough evidence to suggest medicinal cannabis has any benefit for treating psychological disorders, a new study has found. Much has been made in recent years of the positive medical effects of cannabis-derived compounds to treat a range of physical and mental ailments. Mature cannabis plants being grown for medicinal use at the facility run by Medifarm on the Sunshine CoastCredit:Stuart Layt However, there has been relatively little actual research done into the effects of cannabinoids when used to treat conditions, especially mental disorders. A review of the available research, covering 83 studies and three thousand people, has found the use of cannabinoids for mental health issues can not currently be justified. ""One of the reasons we did the review is that a very common reason people report using medicinal cannabis is to treat symptoms of these disorders,"" the University of Queensland's Professor Wayne Hall, one of the study’s authors, said. ""There are disorders where there is evidence of benefit, but the great majority of people who are being treated with medicinal cannabis aren’t being treated for those conditions."" In particular, Professor Hall said nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy patients, muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis and seizures caused by a particular type of epilepsy had been shown to be helped by medicinal cannabis. However, every mental condition which advocates claimed to be able to treat using a cannabinoid simply did not have the evidence to support it. Given that, the study’s lead author, Professor Louisa Degenhardt of UNSW Sydney, said there needed to be more investment in full clinical of medicinal cannabis. ""Clinicians and consumers need to be aware of the low quality and quantity of evidence for the effectiveness of medicinal cannabinoids in treating mental health disorders and the potential risk of adverse events,"" Professor Degenhardt said. ""Given the likely interest but scant evidence to guide patient and clinician decisions around cannabinoids for mental health, there is an urgent need for randomised controlled trials to inform whether there are benefits of cannabinoids for these indications."" In particular there was no reason why cannabinoids were not being subjected to the same regulatory approval process as other prescription medications, the report’s authors said. Professor Hall stressed it was possible there were benefits to using cannabinoids to treat mental disorders, but there simply wasn’t enough evidence to back up the claim at this stage. ""There’s been this early and broad generalisation from the fact that it does have some medical uses that it can be used for any medical purpose, which is what is often advocated by some of the more enthusiastic supporters of medical cannabis,"" he said. ""The risk with THC, which is the ingredient which produces the high in cannabis, there’s a real risk to administering something like that to people who already have disturbed mood, anxiety and depression."" Only 40 of the 83 studies examined were the ideal randomised control trials, where the patients were not aware whether they were receiving the drug or not, while in the rest of the trials patients were aware they were being given cannabis products, potentially skewing the results. The authors pointed out the findings related specifically to medicinal cannabis, such as the medically derived extracts THC and CBD, as opposed to recreational use of cannabis, which has a detailed body of evidence suggesting adverse mental effects with prolonged use. The study has been published in the journal The Lancet Psychiatry, as part of The Lancet’s series on drug use more generally. Copyright © 2023",10,608

This was published 7 years ago Five weeks ago, Bill Shorten visited Cherie and Trevor Dell in their Sydney home to talk about how medicinal cannabis is helping their three-year-old daughter Abbey.  The very next day, the police came knocking. Bill Shorten with Trevor and Cherie Dell and their daughter Abbey.Credit:Brendan Esposito Abbey suffers from a rare genetic disorder known as CDKL5, which results in constant violent seizures. They tried every legal medicine and treatment under the sun but found that nothing worked. Eventually, desperate to relieve Abbey's suffering, they turned to the underground suppliers that provide illegal medicinal cannabis oil to families in need across the country. Before the cannabis treatments, Abbey suffered dozens of seizures every day, with some of them lasting 45 minutes. ""Now we have possibly one per day and some days are seizure-free,"" said Mrs Dell. ""It has definitely helped."" The transformation was so remarkable that the couple started thinking about how they could use it to help their other five children, all of whom suffer from disorders such as autism and ADHD.  After doing some research – and just before the Opposition Leader came to visit – they decided to start Abbey's older brother on the same oil. Before the cannabis, the boy was destructive and violent, often uncontrollable, they said – but as soon as he started the treatment he calmed down, got his emotions under control and started learning in school. Mrs Dell believes someone at their son's school notified the police. They came on a Saturday, when she was out. Mr Dell let them in and admitted: yes, two of our children are using cannabis oil. The couple believe that if Mr Shorten hadn't just visited, things could have gone very differently.  Mr Dell showed police the pictures of the politician in their living room. ""They turned around promptly and said 'see you later, have a good night',"" Mrs Dell said. The Coalition, Labor and the Greens all support the legalisation of medicinal cannabis but differ over how to go about it. Mrs Dell is confident it will be legalised in the coming years. But she believes there should also be an immediate amnesty for families like hers, so they do not have to live in fear of the police. ""There is still that risk of being charged and having a criminal record,"" she said. ""There still is that chance – of them coming and saying, 'too bad, we know that you're in the media but it's our job'. ""We need something done now. Not in a few years, not after the studies are done."" An amnesty could also let them access respite care that is currently out of reach because they're breaking the law. Mr Shorten has since written to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, expressing concerns that the government's policy will leave families at risk of prosecution. He is urging Mr Turnbull to establish nationally consistent laws rather than leave decriminalisation up to the states. ""A person's access to pain relief should not be dictated by the state or territory that they live in,"" Mr Shorten wrote. Mr Turnbull has not responded. Copyright © 2023",11,541

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 3 years ago Medicinal cannabis may be legal but obtaining it has been an exercise in the absurd. My mother, Patricia, is 91 years old. She has spondylitis, which means she is bent over like a question mark and in pain. Eighteen months ago she fractured her L2 vertebrae when my father fell on her. She has macular degeneration. She was diagnosed with leukaemia but the medicos got that wrong then revised it to liver cancer. As she has no symptoms she’s decided to ignore them. Rightly so. It was a long and tortuous path to pain relief from medical cannabis, but it finally came for Patricia Brierley.
 She also has bursitis. We think this came from when she didn’t let go of the retractable hose and went flying through the air. Her comment on that occasion was that she thought she was the ""flying mum"". Yes, my mother’s brain is wonderfully intact, as is her humour. Her body sadly, using a term taken from the vocabulary of a producer friend of mine, is ""Kangaroo Edward"" – rooTed. The problem my mother faced was constant pain and the failure of any drugs her doctors prescribed to counter it. Her quality of life was diminished. She was unable to leave the house, do simple tasks and even get out of bed without being in agony. My view was, and is, that no-one should have to suffer, especially my mother, and so I began researching medicinal cannabis. What I discovered was that there is only one cannabis clinic in Sydney, albeit with a few outlets. The closest to us was George Street in the city. First, Mum had to obtain a referral from her GP. He was unaware of medicinal cannabis and so had to be educated. Next, I made an appointment with the cannabis clinic. This was scheduled weeks ahead as the clinic doctor only works for half a day on Wednesdays. Mum had to be assessed to determine whether she was in enough pain to warrant a prescription. That meant a 20-kilometre cab trip, with her walker, to the clinic. It's on level 11. Thankfully there's a lift. The doctor assessed my mother as a worthy candidate and charged her a $200 consultation fee, to be paid on the spot. He explained that she would also have to hand over another $250 for him to process the paperwork and send it to Canberra. It was a government charge, he explained. When I asked how long this would take, he said anything from 10 minutes to a month, depending who was standing at the other end of the fax machine. Fax machine? And so, $450 out of pocket, we left to wait to hear. Two weeks later the good news arrived. Canberra had approved my mother. However, she would need to return to the clinic to pick up the prescription. I explained she was too frail and in too much pain to do that so it was agreed for me to be the surrogate. This visit lasted all of 10 minutes, cost another $125 and came with the instruction that I had to find a pharmacy that was government-approved to fill the prescription and distribute the drug. Luckily my mum’s local chemist was one such entity. I then learned that it would take two to three days to deliver the medicine to the chemist. There were five repeats. Each prescription would include three 25-millilitre bottles and would cost $600. That comes to $200 per 25ml bottle. I also discovered that the cannabis oil came from New Zealand via its Canadian company and that no Australian company was licensed to provide it. Apparently it’s a very complex process. De Brierley Newton  The cost of getting the first prescription: initial consultation $200, government documentation $250, pick up the script $125, prescription $600. Total: $1175. Having obtained the oil, my mum is now required to make regular contact with the clinic doctor so he can report to Canberra on how she is going. This is mandatory if he wants to retain his licence to prescribe. Cannabis oil has changed my mother’s life. She now goes on community bus trips, has friends and she can get out of bed free from pain. You don’t get high using medicinal cannabis. Even if you did, so what? It alleviates suffering without side effects. During my crusade to ease my mother's suffering, all I could think was, given that we are all going to die in the end, why on earth do we make the trip so difficult? My mother is lucky. She has support. But what of those people in our community who can’t afford the drug, or have no way to navigate the process and whose every day is agony? It’s not enough that medicinal cannabis oil has been legalised. It’s time we manufactured it ourselves. It’s time it was included under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. And it’s time we made this happen. It could be your mother next time. De Brierley Newton is the proud daughter of an independent 91-year-old.  Copyright © 2023",14,867

This was published 4 years ago These days, when Deb Lynch reads that medical cannabis is legal, she just laughs and laughs. “We used to get annoyed about that,” she says. “Not any more.” Ms Lynch expected legalisation would mean she could access the drug to treat her autoimmune disease. But, like many, she has been knocked back and told there is no evidence it would help her. For medical cannabis, some experts believe the hype has surged way past the science, which is weak, inconclusive and often non-existent for many conditions. When cannabis does work, the effect is often small. “The evidence, in general,” says Professor Mike Farrell, Australia’s leading medical cannabis expert, “is modest”. Patients are left deeply frustrated. Tens of thousands have applied for legal access to medical cannabis, mostly to treat chronic pain, estimates Dr Alex Wodak, president of the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation. So far, only 525 patients have been approved. “I have tried multiple doctors over the last four years to try to get a legal prescription,” says Ms Lynch, the president of the Medical Cannabis Users Association of Australia. “I have a letter from the health minister saying there is not enough evidence. Yet I can come up with dozens of peer-reviewed studies saying it works for my condition.” Advocates say standard methods for assessing drug effectiveness do not work when applied to cannabis. Cautious bureaucrats are restricting access to a life-saving medication, they believe. Dr Alex Wodak estimates that tens of thousands have applied for legal access to medical cannabis.Credit:Photo: Richard Baron “The community is onside, the politicians are onside, the government officials are not onside,"" says Dr Wodak. ""Why stop these people?” When he legalised medical cannabis in 2016, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said it was about getting “this life-saving treatment available to the sick kids who need it most”. “This is too important to wait,” the Premier later said. But waiting – waiting for the evidence to come in – is part of Australia’s drug regulation scheme. It takes about 10 months for the Therapeutic Goods Administration to approve a new prescription medicine once its big-pharma backers submit studies proving its effectiveness. These sort of trials do not yet exist for many things people seek to treat with medicinal marijuana. That’s why only one cannabis medication – for multiple sclerosis – has been approved by the TGA. Five-year-old Gemma, who is critically ill, received an early dose of medical cannabis thanks to the Victorian government. This picture was taken at a news conference featuring Premier Daniel Andrews in March 2017.Credit:Eddie Jim “We're getting way ahead of ourselves,” says Associate Professor Adrian Reynolds, president of the chapter for addiction medicine at the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. “It’s interesting that parliament are quick to implement reforms that evidence does not yet support – and yet we provide huge amounts of evidence for things like alcohol harms, and parliament does not want to go there.” Professor Farrell, who is director of the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, conducted a systematic review – considered the gold standard for evidence – on cannabis for the TGA last year. It showed reasonable evidence the drug helped children with drug-resistant epilepsy. There was some inconsistent evidence it helped adults with multiple sclerosis. There was good evidence it was as effective as conventional drugs for stopping chemotherapy-induced nausea – but only compared to older, superseded drugs. The evidence for patients with chronic pain was weak and the effect was, at best, modest. “In relation to pain, most of the studies were of medicinal cannabinoids combined with other pain medications,” Professor Farrell says. “It’s quite important that people don’t have over-expectations of what it might do.” “The data is positive, but it’s modest. The numbers needed to treat is quite high – something like eight or 10 people need to be treated for one to benefit.” But beyond that, there is very little high quality evidence for medical cannabis. Doctors are being barraged with requests for cannabis for a huge range of other conditions where the evidence is nowhere near as robust. A survey conducted by the Medical Cannabis Users Association showed depression/anxiety, chronic pain, PTSD, and cancer/leukaemia were the four biggest illnesses people were seeking cannabis to treat. Professor Farrell is still reviewing cannabis as a treatment for depression and anxiety, but says “the literature on it is very thin”. In fact, other studies suggest cannabis use may increase the risk of developing anxiety and depression. Advocates point to another review, conducted by America's National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, released last year. Confusingly, it found “substantial ... significant” and “conclusive” evidence for the treatment of the same conditions Professor Farrell’s study looked at. Many studies considered by Professor Farrell’s review were randomised controlled trials, which compare a drug to a placebo and are considered the best evidence for pharmaceutical effectiveness. Dr David Caldicott, pictured outside Calvary Hospital, Canberra, where he works in the ED.Credit:Melissa Adams Randomised-controlled trials are not the best way to assess medicinal cannabis, says Dr David Caldicott, who teaches a course on medical marijuana based at the Australian National University. Cannabis contains dozens of active compounds – trials tend to test only one or two. It also tends to affect people differently, and tends to be effective only over a long period. These subtleties are not captured by controlled trials. “An entire new study design is needed for cannabis,” he says. “Many of our colleagues don’t quite understand that.” The issue has split the Royal Australian College of GPs and the College of Physicians. “The problem with medicinal cannabis is we don’t yet have the robust evidence the general public would normally expect if not demand, and the medical profession would normally want,” says the College of Physicians' Professor Reynolds. Doctors should only prescribe a drug when there is proof it works, he said. “Is medicine to remain a scientific endeavour, or is it to become a personal-want-driven endeavour?” Dr Bastian Seidel, president of the College of GPs, is far more bullish. “[America's National Academies of Sciences] made very clear that there is substantial and conclusive evidence that medicinal cannabis is effective for chronic pain, and nausea. They say it’s conclusive,” he said. Dr Bastian Seidel (centre), pictured here with Health Minister Greg Hunt (right) in May 2017.Credit:Alex Ellinghausen As scientists argue over the quality of the evidence, patients continue to seek the drug – with many turning to dubious online sources. Deb Lynch found smoked cannabis was the only effective treatment for her painful and crippling condition. “I would not be here without it,” she says. After being turned away by several doctors, Ms Lynch says she was forced to obtain it illegally. In November last year, police raided her home and charged her with illegal possession, she says. She is still fighting them in court, defending herself on the grounds of medical necessity. “If I had been prescribed, I would not be in court – I’d have it legally.” Copyright © 2023",10,1190

However, consumers have been warned to expect prices for these medicines to be higher than in other countries like the US and UK and could run into the hundreds of dollars a month. While no current prices are yet to be set for any Australian over-the-counter medicines, for a product that contains 150mg of CBD, patients could be paying $7.50 per day, or $230 a month.Credit:iStock  Medicinal cannabis products are already available in Australia via prescription, but the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) changed regulations at the end of 2020 that would let pharmacists dispense low-dose products that contain up to 150mg of CBD, an element of the cannabis plant, without a prescription. Fifteen months on, no product has yet received TGA approval, but industry experts are predicting several companies will have lodged data for these medicines by the end of this year, paving the way for sales in 2023. Chief executive of biotech Emyria, Michael Winlo, said companies are now getting to “the pointy end” of the research process. Emyria, which is backed by Andrew Forrest’s Tattarang, has launched clinical trials for an over-the-counter pill containing a low dose of CBD which is designed to help treat psychological stress. Mr Winlo said he was confident the medicines regulator wanted to approve the nation’s first pharmacy CBD products swiftly, but said they would be looking for strong evidence that treatments worked. “We want to be pioneers and tread new ground - but we need to run a very careful study and put our argument [for approval] together very carefully,” he said. Despite strong demand from Australian patients for the products, Mr Winlo said consumers should be prepared for the reality that these products will have a higher price point many other pharmacy-only medicines. “I think that’s going to take people aback. It will be comparable to what they have to pay today for a [medicinal cannabis] prescription,” he said. Products like CBD oils are currently priced according to the number of milligrams of CBD they contain, with patients paying around 5 cents for every milligram. Emyria chief executive Michael Winlo says companies in the medicinal cannabis space are carefully working to deliver evidence of their products to the TGA.  While no current prices are set yet for any Australian over-the-counter medicines, for a product that contains 150mg of CBD, patients could be paying $7.50 per day, or around $230 a month. Interest in cannabis products has boomed in Australia over the past decade as a multi-billion industry of developers sprung up across the country.  Melbourne-headquartered Cann Group recently launched a phase 3 clinical trial study of a pill to treat short-term sleep disturbances. “We believe we will be well-placed to submit our dossier [of evidence] in October 2022,” Cann Group COO Shane Duncan said. “We believe mid-to-late 2023 [is when we’ll] see the first products launched and we are planning to launch our product within that time frame.” The TGA is currently accepting applications from companies wanting to register low-dose products. “Sponsoring companies can now lodge an application to the TGA for inclusion of Schedule 3 CBD preparations on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. Applications are individually evaluated for safety, efficacy and quality,” the regulator said in guidelines for companies.

Australia has been flagged as a growth market for medical cannabis.Credit:Max Mason-Hubers Meanwhile, AusCann, which started out as Tasman Health Cannabinoids, is lobbying for the legalisation of medicinal cannabis in Australia, with the hope of supplying the drug in the first state to allow it. Adam Blumenthal, the director of corporate finance at BBY, the brokerage firm that oversaw the float of PhytoTech, said the initial uptake confirmed his belief that there was a future for medicinal cannabis in Australia. PhytoTech's stock, which was floated at 20¢ a share 10 days ago, more than quadrupled to 92¢ in volatile trading before closing at 47.5¢ on Friday. ""I would say in 10 years it could be a billion-dollar industry,"" Mr Blumenthal said.  ""The global cannabis market is estimated to be worth $US100 billion ($128 billion) and is growing.  ""In Australia we're only scratching the surface. A lot of the interest has come with this float. It is the first ASX vehicle to offer Australian investors exposure to this sector."" The company aims to supply cannabis products and delivery systems in countries where it is legal.  The increasing support for medicinal cannabis, coupled with NSW Premier Mike Baird's announcement of medical trials, means Australia has been flagged as a growth market. Troy Langman, the director of AusCann, said support for medicinal cannabis was accelerating.  ""Things are just moving so quickly. Once people find out this provides relief for loved ones, they are going to stop at nothing to get it."" Liberal MP Catherine Cusack, who is co-ordinating the NSW government's policy on cannabis, said there would be no decriminalisation or legalisation of the drug. ""It is going to be a permitted activity. There is no way we are decriminalising marijuana – that is not how we see it. It is the opportunity to have a compassionate policy,"" she said. ""It is up to the researchers to propose a strategy to source cannabis that is sufficiently consistent in its chemical composition, and an ample quantity is available to meet the high standards of Australia's clinical trials' processes. If this supply is to be accessed from overseas, a Customs exemption would be required."" Mr Blumenthal said he was realistic about the short-term challenges, namely that legislation had to catch up. ""The biggest hurdle the Australian market faces is that the perception needs to change. As more states are looking to legalise the use of medicinal cannabis there will be more room for other players with different approaches,"" he said. Last October, Anthony Bower, director of Mullaways Medical Cannabis, was fined for possessing an estimated $70,000 worth of marijuana on his North Coast property.

While cannabis can now be prescribed legally for some medical conditions, most doctors have little knowledge of how it can be used, according to legalisation advocates.

""The documents provide clinical information on the effectiveness of medicinal cannabis and guidance for its use in treating symptoms for a number of conditions."" Royal Australian College of General Practitioners president Dr Bastian Seidel says we must be ""open minded"" about medicinal cannabis. There is also a booklet that gives an overview on prescribing medicinal cannabis and one that contains information for patients.

Ally Tregent's critically ill daughter Gemma, 5, is one of the early recipients of prescribed medicinal cannabis.Credit:Eddie Jim Each booklet outlines the evidence for each condition, with some giving an alphabet score for each cannabis product's success to treating  pain, tremors or improving quality of life. They contain information on potential side effects, which appear to be less severe than those for opioid medications and suggest a ""start low, go slow"" approach to dosage. The booklets warn that medicinal cannabis could expose patients to lifelong use of the drug, but also state there is no strong data on this. They state the drug should be used as a last resort, when all other treatments had failed and are not appropriate for patients with conditions such as mood or psychotic disorders. Advocates have complained it is a nightmare for medical professionals and patients to gain access to the drug. Professor Iain McGregor, from the Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics, has written about Australia's system, which he says seems designed to almost guarantee its failure. ""An initial problem facing Australian patients seeking medicinal cannabis is that their GPs often know little about it, and unlike Canada, where GPs can write you a script, a sympathetic Australian GP must enlist the support of a specialist to apply to the Therapeutic Goods Administration for cannabis products,"" Professor McGregor noted. Royal Australian College of General Practitioners president Dr Bastian Seidel​ said this was because a national regulatory framework was desperately needed. Dr Seidel said the booklets were comprehensive. He said side effects were not known for medicinal cannabis, but this was the same for many treatments currently in use, which was reasonable given the lack of evidence. ""We must be open-minded,"" Dr Seidel said. ""Medicinal cannabis has never been the first choice for medical conditions. We need appreciate the treatment with medicinal cannabis is emerging.""

Jackson, widely considered Australia’s greatest female player, announced she was coming out of retirement to play for her home-town team Albury-Wodonga Bandits in the second-tier NBL1 from April 2. The signing could prove vital in Jackson’s possible inclusion in Australia’s national team for the World Cup in Sydney in September. Having retired six years ago due to chronic pain, the three-time WNBA MVP said on Wednesday she was hoping to get an exemption to continue using medicinal cannabis during her return to the sport. Jackson underwent numerous surgeries throughout her career in an effort to assist her degenerative knee injury, but continued to suffer pain in her knee, hip and lower back, even after retiring. The four-time Olympic medallist said cannabis has been the key to her return to the court after years of relying on painkillers. “The last few games, there was so much pain and that ended my career right there, but I don’t feel that any more,” she said. “I am going through the process of trying to get a therapeutic use exemption, but if I can’t get it I will have to stop obviously. “That’s been critical in my ability to recover and come back, just the way that it’s definitely helped me a lot. I’m really thankful I got on that trial and I’m definitely exploring my options to get that exemption.” Jackson grew up in Albury and the home stadium of the Bandits, Lauren Jackson Sports Centre, is named after her. Now also a mother, Jackson said she was also eager to introduce her two sons to basketball. Australian basketball icon Lauren Jackson is making her way back onto the court. Credit:Getty Images “My little boys are going to be around an environment around a team,” she said. “For me to be able to give that to my kids ... it will be beautiful. “To be able to play what will be the end of my basketball journey here in Albury and in NSW is so special and I can’t wait.” As for the World Cup, Jackson said there was a long way to go before even thinking about the possibility of playing for Australia again. If she plays, Jackson will be 41 by the time the World Cup rolls around. “I’m literally just really happy with where I’m at,” she said. “I haven’t played in eight years. It would be absolutely stupid of me to sit here and say I’m going to be there because I’m not at this point.” Jackson was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame last year after an outstanding career highlighted by a 2006 World Cup win for the four-time WNBL MVP, five-time WBL champion and seven-time WNBA All-Star.

This was published 8 years ago Australians suffering from chronic pain may get more relief from their symptoms using cannabis than they do from some conventional medications, researchers have found. A large study of people suffering from chronic problems such as back pain, migraine and arthritis has discovered many are turning to cannabis to relieve their symptoms, despite already being prescribed heavy-duty opioid medications such as morphine and oxycodone. The study found nearly 13 per cent of 1500 chronic pain patients had used cannabis in the past year despite being prescribed opioids.Credit:Rob Homer In a finding that is likely to further intensify the debate about medical marijuana use, the National Drug and Alcohol Centre researchers found people who used the illegal drug said it was more helpful than the highly addictive and potentially dangerous opioid medications. Millions of Australians suffer from chronic pain - a problem set to increase as the population ages. Yet there are few effective and safe long-term treatments, and accidental overdose deaths from prescribed pain drugs are now more common than deaths from heroin. Study leader Louisa Degenhardt found nearly 13 per cent of 1500 chronic pain patients, who were mainly aged in their late 40s  and early 50s, had used cannabis in the past year despite being prescribed opioids. This compared to only 4.7 per cent of the rest of the population, she wrote in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence. ""One in three said they found it very effective to relieve their pain, that's a score of ten out of ten,"" she said. ""Now these are all subjective scores … but it means there is definitely a group of people who think that taking it was very beneficial."" Professor Degenhardt, from the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre and the University of Melbourne, said the study raised important questions about whether the benefits of cannabis for pain should be more seriously explored, but also about the negative effects of drugs, such as patient dependence.   ""The people who were also trying cannabis for pain, they were younger but they had also been living with pain for longer,"" she said. ""Their pain was so severe it had been interfering with their lives.""  Study co-author Nicholas Lintzeris, a medical doctor specialising in addiction and an associate professor of addiction medicine at the University of Sydney, said there had been a huge rise in the number of Australians seeking treatment for addiction to pain medications. This was linked to a lack of multi-disciplinary treatment such as physiotherapy and massage, leaving doctors with little choice but to prescribe heavy-duty painkillers, or even other drugs for which there was little evidence of efficacy, such as antidepressants or antipsychotics. ""Interestingly, in the United States (as there has been more use of medicinal cannabis there), we are starting to see some large epidemiological studies that indicate cannabis use might ... provide other options other than simply an ever-escalating opioid dose [when treatment isn't working],"" he said. ""It could well be that if there were safer cannabinoid drugs that might be a useful strategy"". However, he said there was little known about the cannabis plant, which contains many different chemicals.  The Baird state government has committed to beginning three trials of medical cannabis, for children with the most severe form of drug resistant epilepsy, and people with terminal illnesses and chemotherapy-induced nausea. The Labor party has called for the process to be expedited given the existing evidence for it, while   Greens NSW MP John Kaye said the NDARC paper provided more evidence that both the Liberal and Labor parties were being too cautious. ""It is irrational and cruel to criminalise patients who are obtaining relief from chronic non-cancer pain using medicinal cannabis,"" he said. ""Waiting for yet more evidence before changing the law is a delaying tactic that will see tens of thousands of people suffer debilitating levels of pain needlessly."" Copyright © 2023",16,667

""The new science of cannabinoids has incredible potential for relief of human suffering … and to repair damaged bodies and brains."" Pre-clinical research in Sydney has found one of marijuana's compounds improves memory in mice with Alzheimers-like symptoms. Researchers say only about 10 of its roughly 100 compounds are sufficiently well known for trials to be feasible. The scientific potential of the others remains unexplored. Professor McGregor said the centre could grow its own cannabis for the research under licence from the state's chief pharmacist and will also seek to synthesise cannabis compounds in a laboratory. - with James Robertson Copyright © 2023",12,634

This was published 1 year ago The sports doctor who advised Lauren Jackson on using medicinal cannabis as part of her comeback says the star basketballer has a straightforward case for an exemption, and believes cannabis will eventually be removed from anti-doping banned lists because it is not performance enhancing. Dr Peter Brukner, a sports physician and researcher who has worked with leading sides such as the Australian cricket team, the Australian Olympic team, Liverpool FC and several AFL clubs, has spent the past 12 months studying medicinal cannabis before a clinical trial he is running at La Trobe University this year. The trial is researching the effect of cannabis on osteoarthritis knee pain, and will involve many ex-AFL players. The trial is associated with Levin Health, a Melbourne-based medicinal cannabis company that last year formed a sports advisory panel of Jackson, ex-AFL coach Alastair Clarkson and jockey Damien Oliver. Jackson, a Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer who is rated as one of the best female players in history, has been taking medicinal cannabis since last year to treat chronic knee pain, which led to her retirement in 2016. Jackson has found great relief from the treatment, so much so she began contemplating a return to the court for home town team Albury Wodonga Bandits in the second-tier NBL1 East. But given almost all cannabis products are on the World Anti-Doping Agency list of substances prohibited in competition - and can attract lengthy suspensions - the 40-year said her comeback would hinge on getting a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE). Lauren Jackson playing for the Seattle Storm in 2010.Credit:Getty “If it is prescribed by a doctor under the appropriate process, there is a particular medicinal access scheme in Australia that you have to go through, if it is under that scheme, they will issue a TUE,” Brukner said. “Lauren was concerned that she may not be able to continue taking the cannabis if she goes back. I have reassured her that is not the case.” The need for athletes to seek TUEs for medicinal cannabis may be a moot point in the near future, Brukner believes. Debate has raged for years about whether cannabis is performance enhancing and belongs on WADA’s prohibited substances list. In 2012, the Coalition of Major and Professional Sports, which represents the AFL, NRL, Rugby Australia, Cricket Australia and Tennis Australia, argued that WADA should remove cannabis from the banned list. In 2018, WADA removed cannabidiol, which is more commonly referred to as CBD and is the non-psychoactive, pain-relieving cannabinoid found in cannabis, from its prohibited list. Team doctor Peter Brukner speaks to Australian batsman Matt Renshaw during a series against Pakistan in 2017.Credit:Getty Images Last year, US sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson was prevented from running in the Tokyo Olympics after testing positive to cannabis. After an outpouring of sympathy for the runner, WADA announced it would respond to feedback from “a number of stakeholders” and review cannabis’ status on the prohibited list in 2022. “There is no performance enhancement. The reason cannabis is on the banned list is not because of performance enhancement, it is because of legality issues and they didn’t want to encourage [athletes] to take it,” Brukner said. “Arguably it is performance limiting. There has never been any evidence it is performance enhancing. “I think it will come off soon. There are moves to review it and it probably should have never been on it. It probably affects a sport’s business more, whether people take cannabis or not. It is just one of those things, they put all those illegal, antisocial drugs on the list. “But the use of cannabis has become more and more widespread, it is legal in half the states of America.” Brukner said if trials confirmed medicinal cannabis was an effective source of pain relief for athletes, there would be no reason why active sportsmen and sportswomen could not use it as part of regular treatment.

The 26-year-old from rural Curlwaa on the NSW-Victoria border wants to find work, but the medicinal cannabis she’s used for years stops her from driving. “I still have my driver’s licence, however I have signed a waiver that I can’t use my medication and drive,” Gentle told AAP. “I’m disadvantaged because of a medication that I have been prescribed,” she said. Medicinal cannabis helps with pain relief.Credit:Janie Barrett A NSW inquiry on Thursday examined a bill that would let people like Gentle get on with their lives while continuing to take their medicine. The bill, introduced by Greens MP Cate Faehrmann, would provide a defence against drug driving charges for medicinal cannabis users, similar to existing allowances for people prescribed valium or methadone. “Medicinal cannabis is far safer than morphine and other opioids on and off the road, but it’s only medicinal cannabis patients who test positive who face life-destroying drug driving charges,” Faehrmann said. Drug driving law reform advocate David Heilpern said legislation needed an update. “When they brought these laws forward, there was no medicinal cannabis,” he said. Tests have also became more sensitive, adding to the unanticipated unfairness of the law, Heilpern said. He left his 22-year career as a magistrate in 2020 after presiding over numerous cases where prescribed medicinal cannabis users faced losing their licence, placing their careers and contact with family in jeopardy. “It just seemed to me appallingly unfair,” he said. Australians have increasingly been prescribed medicinal cannabis since it was legalised in 2016 – almost 123,000 prescriptions were issued last year according to the Therapeutic Goods Administration, more than double those in 2020. Gentle was prescribed cannabis in 2019 after suggestions from several specialist doctors. It came at the end of a long road beginning when she was diagnosed with Graves’ disease. After having her thyroid removed, she spent weeks in hospital due to allergic reactions to the prescribed hormone replacements. She was eventually able to leave hospital, but severe nausea caused by the allergy followed her home, and didn’t subside until she found the right medication. “The only thing that got me through, and has worked wonders for me, is cannabis,” Gentle said. “It was obvious in my hospital notes because I was going to hospital once every week for IV fluids and antibiotics and that stopped when I started cannabis.” But until laws change, Gentle is being held back from pursuing the career in psychology she has been studying for, unable to drive to complete required placements. She’s also forced to rely on family for travel due to a lack of public transport in her rural area. Faehrmann said her bill was a chance to solve those problems for Gentle and others in a similar situation. “Medicinal cannabis patients shouldn’t be forced to choose between driving and holding down a job and the only medicine that helps them,” she said. The government will not support the bill. “Medicinal cannabis is not comparable to other drugs, in part due to its widespread use and availability for non-medicinal purposes,” reads the government’s submission – one of 105 to the inquiry. “There is no reliable way to distinguish or prove whether the source of THC is illicit or prescribed,” the government submitted. The bill, and its proposed changes to laws around crime and drugs, will likely depend on support from the opposition Labor party preparing to contest an election in March.

In an Australian first, the state government could begin to treat medicinal cannabis the same as other medications as part of a plan to be drafted over coming months in consultation with MPs, police and doctors and expected to be implemented early next year. Reason Party MP Fiona Patten is pushing for law changes around medicinal cannabis. Credit:Wayne Taylor Medicinal cannabis prescribed by doctors has been legal in Victoria since 2015, but it remains an offence for drivers, regardless of their medical status, to have the drug in their systems. Wednesday’s announcement comes after a five-year campaign by Reason Party MP Fiona Patten, who has argued it is unfair for doctors to prescribe cannabis for patients who are unable to drive after taking the medication. Labor MP Harriet Shing told State Parliament on Wednesday that the government's ""working group"", overseen by the Department of Justice and Community Safety, would report by December 18. She said the move recognised roadside tests at present picked up only the presence of cannabis in a driver's system, without accounting for whether drivers were impaired or not. ""I know that this is a theme which has persisted throughout a range of different sectors and industries, and it's something which I think globally we are working toward finding some more certainty on,"" Ms Shing said. Ms Patten said there were about 4000 users of medicinal cannabis in Victoria who could instantly benefit from changes to the law. ""Australia is the only jurisdiction that prevents medicinal cannabis patients from driving 24/7 and it is simply unfair,"" Ms Patten told The Age. ""Medicinal cannabis patients should be treated in the exact same way as any other patient who is prescribed a medication and should be allowed to drive if it is safe to do so."" Ms Shing said the Parliament working group would include medical experts, road safety groups, Victoria Police and officials from the government's Justice and Transport departments, along with Ms Patten. ""We're looking forward to continuing that collaborative discussion, which I think is borne out by the government's actions and commitment towards developing medicinal cannabis and making sure that we are doing it and doing it properly, to the benefit of those who need it most,"" she said. Ms Shing, who represents eastern Victoria in the upper house, said the Andrews government was ""leading as fast and as well as we possibly can"" on medicinal cannabis and road safety and was further motivated by the potential economic benefits of the medicinal cannabis industry, particularly in regional Victoria.

Medicinal cannabis campaigner and United in Compassion co-founder Lucy Haslam told Fairfax Media the final decision was an ""essential step in the process"". But she said campaigners and patients waiting to obtain medicinal cannabis legally were in a ""holding pattern"" while the regulatory system was being set up. Mrs Haslam said she was also concerned the proposed legal cannabis industry could be ""so bound up in red tape"" that may it not be viable. ""My fear is that the industry will become so expensive that patients won't be able to access a legal supply at an affordable price,"" she said. ""There's also a lot of work to do on educating people and doctors, some of who remain a bit uncomfortable about prescribing medical cannabis to patients."" The final decision comes after Federal Parliament this year lent bipartisan support to changes to the Narcotic Drugs Act to allow cannabis to be legally grown and produced in Australia for medicinal purposes as part of a national scheme. While non-medicinal cannabis will still be illegal, similar products for therapeutic use will be listed on the Schedule 8 list – for restricted drugs including morphine – provided the drugs were obtained by prescription from a doctor under state or territory laws, and it was to be used for therapeutic purposes.

This was published 1 year ago Truck driver William used to endure excruciating pain from arthritis and scoliosis rather than take opioids to relieve it and running the risk of nodding off behind the wheel. The 37-year-old father’s untreated conditions left him moody and his marriage was suffering until his wife, Kristal, insisted he see a doctor, who prescribed him with medicinal cannabis. Truck driver William was charged with drug driving last year after driving with medicinal cannabis in his system.Credit:Chris Hopkins His life turned around as his pain and insomnia subsided. But this all changed in June last year when William – who asked that his surname not be published – was charged with drug driving after returning a positive result for prescribed tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) during a trip to the shops where he lives in rural Victoria. “The medication prescribed means I can’t drive, I can’t work,” William said. “It’s discriminating against me because I can’t take the medication that works. Now, I’ve got to go to opioids that have really bad side effects.” Prescribed medicinal cannabis has been legal in Victoria since 2015, but it remains an offence for drivers to have the drug in their systems. However, this could soon change after a new study found road safety risks with the drug were similar or lower than many other potentially impairing prescription medications, such as opioids, benzodiazepines and antidepressants. Users of these and other prescription drugs are permitted to drive as long as they are not impaired in Victoria. If they are responsible for a car crash while taking their medication as prescribed it is a defence under legislation. Meanwhile, there is a zero-tolerance approach to medicinal cannabis, without accounting for whether they are impaired or not. Reason Party MP Fiona Patten is pushing for law changes around medicinal cannabis. Credit:Wayne Taylor Roadside tests can pick up traces of the drug weeks after consumption, while impairment can last as little as three hours. Policy analysis by researchers from the Office of Medicinal Cannabis at the Victorian Department of Health and tertiary institutions including the University of Melbourne and University of Sydney concluded there was little evidence to justify treating medicinal cannabis patients differently. “It was also quite clear that there are harms associated with patients not being able to access the medication,” lead researcher Daniel Perkins said. Mr Perkins said Australia was out of step with all other counties that have prescription only medicinal cannabis, including the UK, New Zealand, Ireland and Germany, which have policies that allow patients to drive when not impaired. The study resulted from a government working group considering changing medicinal cannabis-driving laws after Reason Party MP Fiona Patten proposed a change to the Road Safety Act 1986 to allow people who have been prescribed the drug to drive as long as they can do so safely. William said he wasn’t impaired seven hours after taking a low dose of medicinal cannabis and that the officers who charged him agreed. He is now fighting the charge in court, with the help of pro bono lawyers David Heilpern, Greg Barns and Mat Henderson, and faces a conviction and licence suspension. Ms Patten said William was one of many chronic pain or cancer sufferers who were forced to take other prescription drugs that were less effective or more dangerous to take while driving. “I had a commitment from the government, that they would work out how do we ensure that medicinal cannabis patients were not unfairly discriminated against,” she said. “What this paper shows is there’s no evidence to suggest that allowing additional cannabis patients to drive when they are not impaired will have any impact on road accidents.” Victoria Police strongly opposes any changes to the act. In a statement, the force said there was significant evidence of a link between the presence of THC in a driver’s system and road trauma. “The law makes it clear that it is an offence to drive or be in charge of a motor vehicle with any concentration of a prescribed drug (one of which is THC),” the statement said. A government spokeswoman said it was considering the working group’s report and would have more to say in due course.

This was published 4 years ago An Australian company is testing whether medicinal cannabis product could be used to treat medical conditions in family pets. After a successful trial of cannabis-based medicine to help treat conditions in dogs, CannPal is now expanding its testing to cats. CannPal founder and Canberran for more than two decades Layton Mills is helping to develop cannabis-based treatments for pets. The company's managing director Layton Mills, who was previously based in Canberra, said the products could be used to treat a range of illnesses. ""For dogs, we've been able to treat conditions like osteoarthritis and hip dysplaysia and skin health and other areas like epilepsy and behavioural issues,"" Mr Mills said. ""When we talk about what can be treated, at the moment the sky is the limit as we're learning more about the plant. ""No one has done this in Australia before."" CannPal recently announced it would work with Eurofins Animal Health to develop pain treatments using cannabis products for cats, with approvals being carried out. The first trial involved 11 dogs; eight were given active compounds containing cannabinoids while the other three were given placebos. Mr Mills said no adverse effects had been recorded in the initial trial. ""Dogs are a lot easier to develop a drug for than cats because cats internal systems are known for being very finicky,"" he said. ""We found that we have a good safety profile with the formulation and now we're able to expand."" Medicinal cannabis for human consumption is already legal in Australia, but patients looking to use it have to go through several approval processes with the Therapeutic Goods Administration, federal and state governments. Among the conditions treated in humans are epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain and chemotherapy-induced nausea. It isn't only the company that's excited by the prospect of cannabis-based medicine for pets. The Australian Veterinary Association said research in the area represented a lot of potential. Veterinary association president Paula Parker said the medicine could provide many benefits once it had been fully tested. ""We're seeing pets live longer and as a result we're seeing more geriatric diseases in pets like osteoarthritic diseases or cancer,"" Dr Parker said. ""There's a lot of potential for treatment using effective compounds and the right dosages."" It's estimated 60 per cent dogs between seven and 11 will develop arthritis and one in two will form some kind of cancer. In cats, 61 per cent of those over the age of six have arthritis in at least one joint. ""There's a recent trend of the humanisation of pets, where they are treated as good, if not better, than children,"" Mr Mills said. ""Pets are being treated a lot better and getting better medical care and are living longer, but a negative result from this is they're developing a lot of age-related issues."" Dr Parker said little was known about the effective of cannabis-derived medicine's effect on pets due to cannabis being illegal in Australia, and little research had been done in the area. She was looking forward to further research in Australia, and findings coming from overseas. ""What our colleagues in the US and Canada have found is as cannabis has become legalised and its becoming more common in homes there, we're seeing an increase in dogs and cats treated for toxicity,"" Dr Parker said. ""We're seeing more edible cannabis products, and with pets being scavengers, they can go after the edible products and can become intoxicated quite easily."" Since trials began of testing cannabis-derived products to treat conditions in dogs, Mr Mills said he had been inundated with correspondence from pet owners across the country. CannPal's founder said the next step in the process was getting the drugs approved and distributed only through registered vet specialists. While the trial with dogs was labelled a success, the upcoming one involving cats would be treated carefully. ""Pending the next six to 12 months of the studies going well, we'll have a really good idea of the success rate of the drug and we'll have a good idea of if the product is going to be approved,"" Mr Mills said.

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 8 years ago I am the mother of a young man with a terminal illness. My son Daniel and I break the law regularly for him to access medicinal cannabis to treat and manage his debilitating cancer symptoms. We don't do this lightly - my husband is a former undercover detective who worked with the drug squad. But Daniel is a young man who has had all manner of conventional medical interventions that have failed him. Which is why I am so exasperated by Professor Nicholas Talley of the Royal Australian College of Physicians, who wrote on these pages on September 4, about his dilemma on medicinal cannabis. I would like to use his comments (which are fairly typical of our medicos in Australia) as a starting point to describe my support for medicinal cannabis.  ""The theory of risk versus benefits as a reason to not allow medicinal cannabis is fundamentally flawed when talking about the terminally ill."" Professor Talley quotes the Hippocratic Oath as a reason to not act on medicinal cannabis. He cites lack of evidence and says he is committed to the needs of his patients as coming first. That is commendable, but I would like to give him another perspective which actually enacts compassion rather than just professing to practice it. I do not intend to discredit Professor Talley, but from where the terminally ill sit, his attitude does not translate into good practice. I must challenge the medical profession on this failure to drive the debate on medicinal cannabis. Their wet blanket approach is heavily impacting on the sick and dying and as a nurse and mother, I cannot sit idly by and allow our politicians be heavily influenced by blinkered medical opinion. I started a medicinal cannabis campaign earlier this year and have been in direct talks with Premier Mike Baird as recently as last week when he visited me at home in Tamworth. I have had no such response from the medical world. I have written to NSW Australian Medical Association (AMA) President Dr Saxon Smith and Federal AMA President Associate Professor Brian Owler  about this issue and heard nothing back from either of them so I direct my comments to them as well as to Professor Talley in this public domain. Clinical trials of medicinal marijuana have been conducted throughout the world; the medical profession in Australia just chooses to ignore them. Is it because of their support for the pharmaceutical industry which so heavily influences medical opinions and treatment choices? Bold question I know, but it is the only conclusion I can make. People prescribing medicine who are continuously given generous gifts by the pharmaceutical industry, would come under third party scrutiny and perhaps considered corrupt, if they were in another setting such as the political arena. The theory of risk versus benefits as a reason to not allow medicinal cannabis is fundamentally flawed  when talking about the terminally ill. The risk of potential long-term adverse side-effects is completely irrelevant to a patient who is facing death. As an example I use my son who needed chemotherapy to treat his illness, but who found the side-effects of treatment worse than the prospect of dying. Had he not found medicinal cannabis the chances are he would have discontinued his treatment. One comment of Professor Talley's I do agree with 100 per cent  is the fact that the Australian government needs to invest in further research and clinical trials. But when is this going to happen? Are doctors and politicians happy to sacrifice the quality of life for our sick loved ones while they ignore clinical trials from around the world? The pharmaceutical industry only invests in trials where they stand to make a lot of money. This is not the case with cannabis medicines. It will be detrimental to the pharmaceutical industry should this natural herb become more widely used as a medicine in Australia. This is what I think needs to happen in Australia: we need more investment and research by the government into cannabis medicines over the long term, but meanwhile the medical profession (and government) needs to support all Australians who do not respond to tried and tested conventional treatment. Don't just continue to ignore the positive experiences described by your patients using medicinal cannabis. Learn from them, study them, and support them. Don't dismiss their experiences as just a placebo effect or anecdotal nonsense. The reality is that the terminally ill are representative of our society and they have been ignored on this issue for too long. The Therapeutic Goods Administration needs to reschedule medicinal cannabis. It is currently classified as a narcotic and a poison. No one has ever died from a cannabis overdose. Recent statistics indicate that deaths from prescription drugs are on the rise in Australia. So what was that Hippocratic Oath again? First do no harm. Legalised and regulated cannabis medicines for the terminally ill would be a very good start. Lucy Haslam is a retired nurse.

""We are a listening government and we agreed it would be a very useful and worthwhile thing to join in with NSW in those clinical trials,"" he said. ""There is a significant difference between regulated pharmaceutical products and using the crude product from the cannabis plant."" The state opposition in turn claimed credit for Queensland's participation in the trials. ""On October 10 last year, I signed off with other health ministers on a bi-partisan agreement that we would co-operate and discuss as a state holding trials and accessing the safety of medicinal cannabis,"" Opposition Leader Lawrence Springborg, the former health minister, said. ""This is the LNP plan being accepted by the Labor government, it's by and large a bi-partisan approval."" Mr Dick refuted that claim, but, beyond the politics, families wanted certainty that what they were doing for their children would be made legal and they would not be prosecuted for what they saw as a loving act. Fairfax Media discretely put the call out to parents who had chosen to treat their children with cannabis oil. About 20 people responded, some of whom agreed to share their stories. Like most people who came forward, Mark did not want to use his real name. And it was little wonder. After all, Mark was breaking the law. ""A lot of people don't realise the number of people affected and the number of people involved because we're all worried about prosecution,"" he said. Mark's seven-year-old daughter developed epilepsy when she was about 15 months old. ""She was always a little bit behind the eight-ball but she was able to do a lot of things,"" he said. ""She used to be able to roll over, she used to reach up and pull herself up in a highchair and eat. ""She was starting to talk and, since her epilepsy started, she's regressed to a stage where she can't do anything. ""She can't eat, she has to be fed by tube."" Mark's daughter used to have up to 200 seizures a day, he said, and the prescribed medications she was on had either stopped working or had terrible side effects. ""We've been told she will slowly get worse and, one day, the inevitable will happen and she'll basically die from what's wrong with her,"" he said. So, at their wits end, they started using cannabis oil about three weeks ago. ""As a father, and as parents, we can't stand by and watch our daughter slowly die and morally and ethically, if there's something that can help I think it's wrong not to use it,"" Mark said. ""She deserves a chance."" And the results have been stunning. ""She's not having any more seizures, she's improved out of sight,"" Mark said. ""She actually wants to eat. ""It's early days yet, but so far all the results are positive – there are no negatives. ""...We realise that it's illegal, but if I had to go to jail, I'd go to jail for my daughter if it meant she could stay on it. ""The nurses say she's looking good and I just keep my mouth shut and say 'yeah'. ""Our kids are at the stage where nothing we do can make it worse. It can only make them better."" Mark said the trials were a welcome development, but ""we don't have that sort of time"". ""We know it's illegal, but when you have a child who the medical system can't help any more, yes there's a substance that is legal in a lot of other countries that has been known to help children like our child, why can't we use it?"" he said. Although Karen's daughter is 18 and has had seizures since she was three, she has not used cannabis oil. But Karen desperately wanted to administer the oil. She was just too scared of being caught. ""It's against the law, so I won't do it, but at the same time I'm a mum who can't see her child suffering like that,"" she said. ""Knowing that it worked for other people in other countries, does that mean I have to fly her there? ""I'll be broke, I'll have to sell my house, or do I just stand there and watch her convulse and get knocked out every time. ""We've got to get out of these dark ages. This is Australia."" About three years ago, Karen's daughter started to lose her ability to walk and had deteriorated to the point she was confined to a wheelchair ""We listened to what the neurologists said and we followed the advice and instructions on medicine, so we just gave her all the anticonvulsants, but none of them actually helped her at all,"" Karen said. ""We have also tried diets, everything, all that we can hear of we just try it."" But, so far, Karen has drawn a line at cannabis oil. ""We know that it's worked for others and all we want to know is that, if it worked for others, why can't it be legalised?"" she said ""Everyone has a right to life. I know (cannabis) has been used badly by other people, but surely if it's good for some, those of us who really need it for a good reason should be able to have access to it without any fear of being on the wrong side of the law."" Danielle Graham was the only person willing to speak freely using her own name. Ms Graham's son, an epileptic, was totally dependent on his parents. He would have up to 100 seizures a day, up until January when Ms Graham started to orally administer the cannabis oil drops into her son's mouth. ""I know I shouldn't be doing it, but I am,"" she said. Ms Graham said she had no regrets. ""We just had no more options and had to seek it ourselves,"" she said. ""I spoke to specialists about it, but because it's illegal I had to do my own research and get it myself."" The difference, Ms Graham said, had been staggering. ""He is still having seizures, but more rarely. He used to have 50 to 100 a day – I'm talking someone who has not gone a day without seizures since he was two,"" she said. ""To give you an idea of how much it's worked, we go to Coffs Harbour once a year as a family and every time we drive there, he seizes 50 to 100 times. ""I started giving him the cannabis oil in January and went to Coffs in April for Easter. ""He didn't have one seizure."" But it had not been without moments of panic. ""We've had our moments where I've been really stressed, you know, the police would drive past or pull me up for something and it's like 'oh my god, is it that?',"" she said. ""I do get very panicky, but I do know here in Brisbane that people using it who have gone public haven't had the police knocking on their doors. ""So it does worry me, but I had no other choice. The amount of times you hold your child and his lips go blue – enough was enough."" Annalise has an eight-year-old son who has uncontrolled epilepsy with subclinical seizures. That meant, she said, there were no outward signs of what was actually going on. ""Because you don't have anything clinical to go on, it's hard to know what's actually happening, apart from on an EEG,"" she said. ""But the condition, as you would assume if your brain is active all night while you're asleep, you should be expecting regression in skills, which we're not seeing happening so we can only assume the cannabis is helping."" Annalise said the hardest part was finding a source of the cannabis oil. ""We were able to find a supplier that I was happy with, which had been proving to be the biggest hurdle, to find someone we could trust,"" she said. ""That's the most difficult thing – finding a trusted supplier and a constant supplier, if you're not going to grow it yourself, which is an option a lot of people take. ""I mean, what if you got your kid on it, it works, and then you can't get it?"" Still, Annalise said she wished she could talk to medical professionals about the course of action she had taken. ""Part of the frustration is that we don't have doctors we can talk to, we don't have people with knowledge other than people who have personal knowledge of doing it themselves illegally,"" she said. ""But we don't feel like we can go to our doctors and get guidance. We've just got to try to do it as scientifically as we can."" And, always, Annalise was looking over her shoulder. ""We got a knock on the door early in the morning one morning and it was the first thing that pops into your brain is, 'who is that? Why are they here?' and your heart goes a bit faster,"" she said. ""But it was just a delivery man running a bit earlier than planned, but you don't really realise until that happens how much it is in the back of your mind."" Along with every other affected person Fairfax Media spoke to, Annalise wanted an assurance of amnesty for all those who went down the cannabis path. - with Amy Remeikis Copyright © 2023",10,1817

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 3 years ago Medical professionals want more information about medicinal cannabis before they start prescribing it to patients, a new study has found. Researchers from the Queensland University of Technology conducted a wide-ranging review of 26 published studies across Australia, the United States, Canada and Ireland. Health professionals support medicinal cannabis as a treatment option but many don't know enough about it.Credit:Alamy QUT pharmacy PhD candidate Kyle Gardiner led the analysis and said the main theme running through all the studies was that medical professionals broadly supported the idea of medicinal cannabis but lacked information about it. “Health professionals support medicinal cannabis but that support is sometimes offset by their concerns,” Mr Gardiner said. “Although they might feel it has a place in therapy, they also don’t have a clear idea about where it fits.” In particular, a major concern among many of the health professionals surveyed was the psychiatric effect of medicinal cannabis, which it was felt had not been researched thoroughly enough. In nearly every jurisdiction where medicinal cannabis is legal, at least one medical professional is required to sign off for a person to access it. “There’s a big difference between being supportive of medicinal cannabis and actually delivering medicinal cannabis on the ground,” Mr Gardiner said. “There’s still a lot we don’t know about medicinal cannabis ... when it comes to the pharmacology, what does it do on a molecular level and how does it affect things like chronic pain or symptoms of MS [multiple sclerosis]?” Mr Gardiner stressed the study - supervised by Professor Lisa Nissen, Head of QUT’s Faculty of Health School of Clinical Sciences - wasn’t about the benefits of medicinal cannabis itself, but how medical professionals reacted to the emerging treatment. “It puts health professionals in quite a tricky position, because if you don’t have a good understanding of a drug, how best do you move forward from a clinical perspective?” he said. The Queensland government last month passed laws making it easier for doctors and patients to access medicinal cannabis, after initially making it legal in 2015. Under the new changes, medicinal cannabis is treated the same as other drugs of addiction or prescription drugs. In welcoming the new laws, Health Minister Steven Miles said medicinal cannabis had “great potential” as a treatment and an industry. “There are several companies working towards having medicinal cannabis products produced locally in Queensland,” he said. “I look forward to following their progress in taking their products to market. This will help improve access for people and reduce costs for these increasingly important medicines.” Importantly, despite the changes for medicinal cannabis it remained illegal for the Queensland public to grow cannabis for medical purposes. The study found overall there was a growing acceptance of medicinal cannabis as a treatment option in newer studies compared to older ones. It also found overall specialist practitioners were more likely to be supportive of medicinal cannabis as a treatment option than health professionals in general or community practice. The findings have been published this week in the journal PLOS One. Copyright © 2023",8,533

Premier Mike Baird will launch a symposium on the medical use of cannabis.Credit:Alex Ellinghausen Lucy Haslam, whose 24-year-old son Daniel has been using cannabis for relief of nausea, vomiting and poor appetite related to chemotherapy for the treatment of bowel cancer, has organised the symposium with the support of state government funding. To be held in Tamworth on Friday and Saturday, the symposium follows Mr Baird's public support for finding a way to use cannabis as a medical treatment for illnesses such as cancer. The symposium will host a range of Australian and overseas health and legal experts to discuss the merits of the treatment. Earlier this year, Nationals MP for Tamworth Kevin Anderson drafted a private members bill to allow terminally ill patients to use cannabis.  Mr Baird later announced the NSW government would run clinical trials of the drug. The trial will be devised by a working party that will report back to the government by the end of the year. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has thrown his support behind the planned trial. Mr Baird has also said the existing police discretion to not charge terminally ill adults if they are caught using cannabis for pain relief would be formalised through new guidelines. He said the clinical trial would ""explore further the role cannabis can play in providing relief for patients suffering from a range of debilitating or terminal illnesses"". Last year, a NSW Upper House Inquiry recommended the state government approve use of cannabis for those suffering from chronic pain and amend the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act to add a defence to cover the authorised use. Health Minister Jillian Skinner indicated she would not support the recommendation but wrote to the federal government asking for further clinical research on the issue. Ms Haslam said Mrs Skinner and the Australian Medical Association had declined her invitation to the symposium.    Copyright © 2023",9,377

This was published 7 years ago This is the second article in a series looking at the medical cannabis debate The boxes were piled high in the reception area of Richard Di Natale's Parliament House office and a picture hook still hung empty on the wall from the recent move as he folded his laptop, stuffed it into his hand luggage and headed for the door. Greens leader Richard Di Natale, who is trying to push medicinal cannabis law reforms through the Senate. Credit:Jay Cronan Life had taken on a whole new level of craziness since the Greens senator from Victoria had taken over the party leader's office following the sudden abdication of Christine Milne, and he was still trying to find time to move in properly. He was running late for the plane he was hoping to catch out of Canberra that night and back to his refuge, the farm in Victoria's Otway Ranges. ""I don't care who does it, whether it's the government or us, as long as it happens,"" he said to his adviser as they hurried down the long corridor leading to the Senate entrance of Parliament House. ""I know that, but it's important that some of the credit is seen to come back your way, you need to think of that too,"" the adviser told him, pushing against the heavy brass-handled door to where the government cars were waiting outside. A flood of issues had been landing on his desk at an alarming rate recently - a blur was how he had described it to his party colleagues and supporters. But one issue he had been working hard on since before the craziness began was starting to look promising - an overhaul of the longstanding prohibition on cannabis for medicinal use. NSW, Victoria and Queensland had joined forces to begin clinical trials of the drug, BRW rich listers Barry and Joy Lambert had just made a surprise $33 million donation to cannabis research at the University of Sydney and surveys showed the public was largely on side. ""I want to be very clear on this, there needs to be a strong line between recreational use and people with genuine medical need,"" he said, as he presented his plan, although in truth he knew there would always be a grey zone. If it meant a few people on the margins would get access to cannabis so that those in end-stage cancer with intractable nausea would get the treatment they needed, so be it. Like many GPs, his training had taught him that cannabis was a dangerous narcotic that had no place in modern medicine. But his political experience had taught him otherwise, as patient after patient already using the drug illegally presented their compelling stories to him. He had spent hours reading through the 191 submissions that had arrived since the Senate had referred his bill for a regulator of medicinal cannabis to committee for review. Greens leader Richard Di Natale prepares to leave his Parliament House office.Credit:Jay Cronan The doctors, researchers, support groups and government officials had warned him it wouldn't be easy, but with patients overseas seeing impressive results and a growing body of credible scientific literature, there was an overwhelming case in favour of making the drug available here too, he thought. There is certainly more to learn about medicinal cannabis, but we know more than enough to act now But nothing happens fast in this building, especially without supporters. Through his role on the joint parliamentary committee on drug law reform he had managed to carefully piece together support for his bill from across the political spectrum, including from some surprising places: conservative Coalition MPs, Labor and even a few government ministers. ""We have a big opportunity in front of us, and I'm optimistic - no, I'm confident, yeah, I'll say confident - that if we were to allow this bill to be debated and voted on in the Senate this year it would be passed,"" he said. But as he looked further into the issue, he discovered a fiendishly complex web of regulations, narcotics laws and international obligations standing in the way. It wasn't politics this time that was blocking reform - it was red tape. The first and foremost barrier was the Therapeutic Goods Administration, the body responsible for authorising the use of medicines in Australia. To get a medication approved by the TGA required an application that typically cost about $200,000 - not a large sum for a drug company expecting to make millions off a new product. But unlike the unique molecules patented for other commercial drugs, cannabis medicine developed by pharmaceutical companies had a cheap and readily available competitor - plants that grew like weeds in most parts of the country, severely limiting the amount a company could earn selling a commercialised medical version. Extracting the compounds to make oil was also relatively straightforward, and the few companies that had tried to break into the Australian market with products like Sativex had struggled to make an impact against the herbal alternative. To get a drug on to the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods also required significant scientific evidence that could take years to compile locally - years that those who had written the submissions sitting on his desk didn't have. While he was fully supportive of the need for further trials, he could also see the potential for them delaying change. Having studied Tasmania's opium poppy industry, he had decided the best way to get change through quickly was to sidestep the TGA altogether, creating a regulator that could authorise strictly vetted growers and distributors to put together a reliable, stable product that could be prescribed with confidence by doctors. Snapshot of recreational cannabis use Having watched states and territories across the country, including the ACT, NSW, and Victoria launch their own attempts to help medicinal users, he had formed a firm view that any change needed to happen at the national level. What he didn't want to see was a repeat of the experience in the United States, where cannabis remains illegal federally, but has been approved by 23 states for various uses, including in some states, recreational. ""If the federal government doesn't pass national legislation we could end up with this tangled mess of state laws where people don't have any certainty about what the penalties are that apply to them and whether they are still getting access to a known quality dose. All the current state and territory laws currently do is stop people being prosecuted for possession, but they don't deal with supply. ""We either treat this as a medicine, or we don't,"" he said. He was even hoping to hand over presentation of the bill to the government to ensure it was given enough time to be debated properly. But powerful groups were beginning to line up to voice their objections. ""The creation of a new regulator solely to regulate medicinal cannabis has the potential to fragment the regulation of medicines in Australia as well as lead to confusion and unnecessary duplication,"" Pharmacy Guild of Australia executive director David Quilty said in his submission. ""This will introduce an additional level of regulation that is unnecessary; existing provisions for regulating medicinal cannabis products are effective and have been used,"" Medicines Australia said in theirs. ""The bill as currently drafted leaves a number of important legal and practical issues unidentified and/or unresolved, leading to the risk of regulatory gaps, overlapping laws, lack of clarity and … possible inconsistency with other existing laws,"" Department of Health secretary Martin Bowles warned, as he reeled off a long list of international and domestic obligations that would potentially clash with the bill. ""I can understand why someone like Medicines Australia might be opposed,"" Di Natale said. ""It doesn't conform to the model of a traditional pharmaceutical and some people would argue it is a competitor. If you look at the US, there's now emerging evidence that there has been decreasing reliance on pharmaceutical opiates and one consequence of that is a reduction in the number of opiate-related deaths. ""What this can do is actually remove the need for pharmaceutical companies to be involved at all - but first we need to get this overarching framework in place and just get this done,"" he said, frustration starting to build in his voice. As he gathered his papers and prepared to leave, he looked at the form that had been pressed into his hand earlier that day at an Australian of the Year nomination event. He had always been impressed with the individuals in the community who had managed to turn personal tragedy into something positive, and he thought about Lucy Haslam. He thought about the time he had met the Tamworth mother who had become a tireless campaigner for medical cannabis reform, despite having to watch her son slowly die in front of her. Together she and her son Dan had helped convince NSW Premier Mike Baird to put $9 million into clinical trials of the drug. ""Losing a 25-year-old son to bowel cancer, that's enough to make most of us want to crawl into a ball and not want to engage with the world,"" Di Natale said as he looked at the form. ""But the way she has used it to really drive this issue, I am full of admiration for her."" He folded the piece of paper carefully in half, tucked it into his carry-on bag, snapped out the handle and rolled towards the waiting cars. Maybe it was people like her, rather than the politicians, who had the greatest chance of driving this change. Less than four kilometres away on the other side of Lake Burley Griffin a university researcher, a businessman and another politician from a different parliament were huddled around a table trying to solve the same problem. The businessman, Curus Medical managing director Andrew McCrea had heard about an ACT bill that, if passed, would open the doors to medical cannabis use in the territory. He had also heard of Greens MLA Shane Rattenbury's idea to establish a legal cannabis industry within the ACT akin to Tasmania's poppy crops, and liked what he was hearing. Like many of those pushing for change, personal experience had led McCrea to cannabis. His wife, Jane, had been crippled by fibromyalgia, a chronic, debilitating muscle condition that left her with extreme pain in 16 points on her body. ""Her life is a misery, she's bedridden mostly,"" McCrea told those around the table. The doctors had told them they didn't have a cure for her, so he went looking for one himself. His journey had taken him across the globe, to countries where sufferers of similar conditions to Jane's were getting access to a drug that had the potential to reduce her symptoms and pain by up to 80 per cent. He had seen a chance to help his own family and thousands of others. But first he needed to find a state or territory willing to recognise the need for change where he could base his work. ""My assessment is this is the simplest way to get a scheme up and operating quickly to help those in need right now. I don't believe there are any insurmountable issues that anyone has put to me that we can't work out,"" Rattenbury said. Greens MLA Shane Rattenbury wants to establish a medical cannabis industry in the ACT.Credit:Melissa Adams He too had read the reports about mining companies starting to look at medicinal cannabis as a potential alternative income source and the potential $100 billion size of the global market. ""Why shouldn't this be a new industry for the ACT?"" he asked. ""We talk a lot about the need to diversify the local economy, well, here's an opportunity."" But like Di Natale, he too was learning that even when there was broad political and community support, sometimes that wasn't enough. ""While I cannot deny there is mounting overseas evidence to support the use in certain medical conditions, my initial thoughts are that we cannot support this legislation in its current form,"" Australian Medical Association ACT president Dr Elizabeth Gallagher had written in response to his bill. ""Certainly, if medical marijuana is to be made legal it should be in the context of a trial, where the risks and benefits can be quantified, where the doses can be monitored, and the method of delivery can be directed and administered in its safest form. Ideally, we would develop synthetic cannabinoids directed at the therapeutic benefits while bypassing the psychotropic and psychological effects."" Rattenbury, too, worried that clinical trials could create years of delay. He agreed with McCrea that there was enough clinical evidence already, it just needed to be collated and presented. The academic from the University of Canberra explained that rather than duplicate the trials planned for NSW, the research collaboration Curus was proposing would draw together existing scientific evidence and literature that would give policy makers, doctors and the community the reassurance they needed to allow cannabis into the hands of patients. Rattenbury picked up a Medical Journal of Australia article sitting on the office table and reread the two paragraphs he had circled earlier in yellow highlighter: ""A civilised and compassionate country that supports evidence-based medicine and policy should acknowledge that medicinal cannabis is acceptably effective and safe, and probably also cost-effective. ""There is certainly more to learn about medicinal cannabis, but we know more than enough to act now,"" it said. He stared at the page and placed it back on the table. If only it was that simple.

Australian Medical Association Queensland spokesman Dr Jim Finn said the AMAQ supported the evidence-based use of medicinal cannabis. ""We support medicinal cannabis being prescribed if it is supported in literature,"" he said. ""For example, with opioids, an opioid poppy can’t be grown due to restrictions, but derived products such as codeine have uses. ""We are in the early stages with cannabis, we still need to understand what uses it could have. ""The only way to get research done is to have established farm facilities to create cannabis products, the farms have to be there before we can medicinal cannabis out there."" The approved farm is located less than three kilometres from a school and surrounded by parks. Dr Finn said as long as the facility was secure and the cannabis was grown in a contained environment there should be no risk to the public. ""Tasmania is one of the largest pharmaceutical opioid exporters in the world, this doesn't cause problems there due to the security and restrictions in place,"" he said. Dr Finn said this was the first time he had heard a medicinal cannabis farm being set up in the greater Brisbane area. A Queensland-based company, Medifarm, was awarded the state's first licence to legally cultivate and produce medicinal cannabis in April. The same company asked the Queensland government for funding to build a Centre of Excellence at the University of the Sunshine Coast later that month, which it said would draw together leading medicinal cannabis manufacturers and farmers.

This was published 4 years ago Marina Spence and daughter Mikayla Marina Spence has finally found a solution for her daughter Mikayla's debilitating epilepsy - she's just not sure how her family can sustain it. ""You've tried everything else and nothing else has worked,"" the Rossmoyne mother said. Mikayla, 13, suffers from a rare disorder that causes multiple seizures each and every day... but medicinal cannabis has changed her life. ""She has a rare and complex neurological disorder and seizures are a very big part of that,"" Ms Spence said during an emotional interview with Gareth Parker on Radio 6PR's Mornings program. ""Another big challenge she faces from this condition is neurological irritability, which means she feels a lot of discomfort and sensory overload. ""Those two challenges present consequences that impact her every day life. ""So, when she's having seizures, it affects her cognition, her ability to concentrate, to learn, to communicate, and the irritability means she is feeling pain and discomfort pretty much a lot of the time. ""A typical day is a cycle between having seizure clusters,  a little bit of calm and some irritability. ""On her worst days, which can extend out to months and months, she can cycle essentially from one to the other. ""So she can go from a high period of irritability - screaming, banging her head, trying to get the pain out - where everything that she does is uncomfortable. ""You can't touch her, you can't look at her ... noise, crowds, people around her ... it drives her crazy basically... and she just needs to be alone and in a quiet dark place. ""Then she'll go completely quiet, and the quiet means she's in a seizure... and so that essentially can happen all day, every day, so you can imagine the impact on her quality of life, having to endure that going on inside her head. ""You can imagine what people think when they see her as well, and quite often there are situations where she's been labelled as having bad behaviour because of the way her condition manifests, so it's quite humiliating to have that go on."" Medicinal cannabis will be dispensed to children in Victoria with severe epilepsy. Regular family life just can't exist for the Spences ... reading books, watching movies, opening Christmas presents, family weddings, picnics... they basically cannot do if Mikayla is going through a particularly difficult time. ""The impact for her brother [aged 14] and his quality of life has been profound as well and as a family unit if you can't do those basic and essential things that bond a family together, of course it's going to have an effect,"" Ms Spence said. ""Our family bond has suffered and you can understand why families in situations like ours can end up breaking down because the pressure is so great."" Effective treatments for Mikayla's epilepsy were non-existent before the medicinal cannabis road opened for the Spence family. ""In 13 years we have tried pretty much everything,"" she said. ""Essentially we were getting a whole bunch of side effects without much benefit. ""So that's why parents like myself will look to something because you've tried everything else and nothing else has worked."" Ms Spence convinced Mikayla's neurologist to submit an application to the Therapeutic Goods Administration for special access to MC, with a panel in Canberra determining whether the young teenager was worthy of access to the drug. ""It took several months to receive approval ... Mikayla's neurologist did infer it would be expensive, but I didn't have any idea of how expensive until I put the script into the pharmacy and was committed to buying it."" Only one supplier in Perth sells MC in oil form that contains no THC - the marijuana component that gives cannabis smokers a high - and 100 per cent CBD, the hemp part that provides health benefits to epilepsy sufferers like Mikayla. Her family ordered three 25ml bottles initially and were hit with a $533 charge... per bottle, which usually lasted only six days - or $30,000 each year for the Spences to help their girl. After starting ""low and slow"" with dosage levels for Mikayla, the effects were markedly more positive after a higher amount was administered. It left the Spences with no choice but to continue down the expensive road so their daughter - and family as a whole - could live each day as close to a ""normal life"". ""She's been on it now for about four weeks ... as we increased the dose I could see an immediate change,"" Ms Spence said. ""She is still having some seizures but they have definitely reduced. ""What is happening now is, the time between her seizure cycles, she is a completely different person. ""It has helped with the severe irritability ... so she's no longer screaming, no longer trying to bang her head on her arms or legs or whatever she can reach. ""Her cognition has improved significantly, so she can focus, concentrate, read books, look at things, respond to your voice in a really timely manner ... there's no huge delay like there was before. Mikayla has also been able to communicate more effectively with those around her, something that was blocked to her before. ""This is key to someone who can't speak using words,"" her mum said. ""It means they can make themselves understood ... and I can see her personality, her cheeky nature. ""She's actually enjoying herself, which she wasn't before, so her quality of life has been significantly improved."" Family life had also become much more happier in the Spence household. ""There's calm, everyone's relaxed, we can actually talk to each other, actually sit around the table and eat together... as opposed to us eating together and Mikayla eating somewhere else separately,"" Ms Spence said. Given the current high costs of approved medicinal cannabis products in Australia, are they still a realistic option for an ongoing treatment program, especially for young people like Mikayla? ""Absolutely not,"" Ms Spence lamented. ""And that's the dilemma. ""I had to try it because nothing else worked and we were desperate, and now we're in the situation where I'm thinking 'oh my gosh, it has had a significant impact, how on earth am I going to continue to pay for this'. ""And how can I actually let her go back to her life before this.""  Adult concoctions of medicinal cannabis are generally cheaper, as they contain some THC and require less processing to break down the marijuana components. There are also more suppliers of these types of strains in Perth. Dr Joe Kosterich, a medical advisor for Little Green Pharma, the Perth-based medicinal cannabis company awarded the first licence to grow and produce the product in WA, said prospective patients were realistically years from having cheaper access to MC. Dr Joe Kosterich is an advocate for using medicinal cannabis to treat certain patients. Those were generally epilepsy sufferers like Mikayla, chemotherapy patients who endure nausea and vomiting, or those with multiple sclerosis or chronic pain. ""We need more access ... the bigger the market, the more companies and competition we will have, and that will drive prices down,"" Dr Kosterich told WAtoday. ""It's not even an approved product yet, so each application requires TGA approval. ""To get on the PBS (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme), you then need a number of placebo-controlled trials in each area [MS, epilepsy, chronic pain and chemotherapy patients)."" Dr Kosterich said companies in these spaces were looking at opportunities to conduct trials ... ""initially dosage regime, side-effect profiles"". But despite growing interest and awareness of medicinal cannabis as an appropriate treatment option for those with any of the four conditions, ""big pharma"" was not so keen. ""This is not your stock-standard medication, it's complex and not just about molecules, for example,"" he said. ""[Big pharma] also can't patent medicinal cannabis, like they can a vitamin."" Once companies in the industry had received TGA approval for their strains of cannabis, it didn't necessarily mean the product would be PBS-listed either, despite the success of similar ones overseas as a safe, simple and effective form of treatment. ""We're using a plant, an extract ... and we know what we're dealing with,"" Dr Kosterich said. ""We know it's safe for humans to take, we've seen evidence of its effect as a successful treatment overseas. ""It's now up to individual companies to get their product approved... then production will increase, we will need more harvesting, we'll start producing more and it will become cheaper to buy."" But in WA, this day is still years away, a gap that will feel like a lifetime for Mikayla Spence, her family and the many others in similar situations all across Australia. So given the Spence's extraordinary dilemma, what does Marina see as the future for them and her 13-year-old daughter? ""I'm almost numb to it, I'm almost feeling like I will robotically go to the pharmacy and order the next script, and order the next script and put it in on the credit card and put it on the credit card and end up all of a sudden in a huge dire financial situation,"" Ms Spence told Parker's program. ""I almost can't think about it, because it's painful to imagine going back to what was before... ""I can't do that to Mikayla, and I can't do that to my son ... so I don't know.""

This was published 7 years ago Stories of children with drug-resistant epilepsy have reportedly moved Queensland's premier into announcing the state's first trial of medicinal cannabis.

Trials will begin in Queensland of medicinal cannabis.  The premier said she discussed the trials with her NSW counterpart Mike Baird on Friday during the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) meeting in Canberra. ""This trial is about letting the experts do as much research as possible into this issue so that we can all get a clearer understanding of any clinical benefits medicinal cannabis can provide,"" Ms Palaszczuk said. She said she spoke with the mother of a boy who suffers uncontrollable epilepsy and is keen to allow medical experts to research whether cannabis can help him and others like him. NSW is spending $9 million over five years on three trials for medicinal cannabis to treat terminally ill patients, children with epilepsy, and cancer patients suffering from chemotherapy-related nausea. Queensland will work out details of its trial after discussion with NSW experts but is yet to determine how much it will commit to the program. AAP Copyright © 2023",5,232

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 6 years ago The ACT government has rejected a push to create an effective amnesty for medicinal cannabis users by directing police not to charge them with drug offences. Canberrans who rely on medicinal cannabis to treat serious illness or chronic pain are currently forced to break the law to seek relief, and a number, including campaigner Laura Bryant, have spoken publicly of their constant fear of arrest.  Greens MLA Shane Rattenbury proposed a direction to police that they not charge medicinal cannabis users. Credit:Rohan Thomson Moves to establish legal medicinal cannabis cultivation are continuing federally, with changes to the Narcotics Drugs Act passed in February, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration and Department of Health advancing plans to lower barriers preventing access. But there is considerable pressure for more to be done locally. Last month, advocacy group The Med Shed was set up to pressure ACT politicians ahead of the October territory election.  
Police Minister Simon Corbell said his ministerial directions to ACT Policing were not the right way to create an amnesty for medicinal cannabis users. Credit:Rohan Thomson Group co-ordinator Matthew Holmes called on Justice Minister and Greens MLA Shane Rattenbury to provide an amnesty for medicinal cannabis users from prosecution.  Mr Rattenbury was already attempting to convince Police Minister Simon Corbell to do just that.  He wrote to Chief Minister Andrew Barr and Mr Corbell in March, seeking that the police minister use his annual directions to ACT Policing – designed to guide the force's priorities for the year – to create an effective amnesty for medicinal cannabis users.  Mr Rattenbury's proposal sought a direction to police that they not charge genuine medicinal cannabis users with drug-related offences.  He proposed users would require certification by a doctor as having a particular illness, and would be listed on a registry and given an ID card.  Conditions could be associated with the amnesty, Mr Rattenbury proposed, including that the person must not supply the drug to others. But the government, which is broadly supportive of a national medicinal cannabis scheme, rebuffed the Greens proposal, saying the ministerial police directions were not the right way to create such an amnesty, and that it would have little practical effect, because police already knew to focus their efforts on suppliers, not individual users. Mr Rattenbury said he was disappointed that the government had rebuffed the proposal. ""This is actually about providing peace of mind to people who are in a very vulnerable place,"" Mr Rattenbury said. ""They are largely law-abiding people who wouldn't dream of entering into the drug scene per se, but they know that cannabis can be used in a medicinal way,"" he said. ""They're nervous, and this is about giving them confidence."" The ACT government is supportive of allowing medicinal marijuana use in ""limited circumstances for particular forms of illness"", but wants a national approach, and a national cultivation and manufacture scheme.  Locally, the ACT is considering how it will need to reform laws and develop clinical guidelines to facilitate medicinal cannabis use. But Mr Corbell said that his formal directions to police were simply not the right way to create an amnesty from prosecution for users.  He said police already had a wide discretion and an existing practice of focusing their efforts on suppliers, not individual users.  ""It's outside the scope and purpose of the [ministerial] direction to do that, the direction is to express the minister's expectations or priorities for policing activity,"" he said. ""In the meantime, police already have significant discretion, and indeed existing ACT policing policy recognises that law enforcement resources should be directed at suppliers and not users."" ""It's really nothing more than the police do day-to-day, in terms of exercising their judgment around cannabis possession and use."" A Legislative Assembly committee report recommended the ACT not move forward with its own medicinal cannabis production scheme last year.  Victoria became the first state to legalise marijuana cultivation for the treatment of serious medical conditions including cancer, multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy and chronic pain. Mr Rattenbury had pushed for the ACT to introduce a similar scheme, but that was rejected by the government.  Copyright © 2023",8,709

Ana Maria GazmuriCredit:@AnaMariaGazmuri Gazmuri told WAtoday although the use of medicinal cannabis was been legalised in WA, there remains a challenge to educate the wider public about its benefits as it becomes a part of society. ""In Chile, educating the community on the benefits of medicinal cannabis has been key to normalising its use and clearing prejudices installed by decades of prohibition,"" she said. ""Training doctors and facilitating access to patients is also paramount as this allowed us to develop excellent results, which we could share quickly via testimonies in the media. ""Australia should invest in more doctor training and easier access for patients. We have successfully treated many patients in Chile who have really benefited from these safe, effective and inexpensive medicines. ""The acceptance of medicinal cannabis was absolutely driven by social attitude, and now medicine is catching up."" Zelda Therapeutics and Gazmuri's Daya Foundation ran an observational autism trial which they claimed had success using medicinal cannabis extracts to treat the core symptoms of autism - clinical trials are expected to commence later this year. Speaking about the overall medicinal cannabis sector, Gazmuri said patients in Chile are seeing beneficial changes and that when supplies become readily available in Australia the difference will be apparent. ""Already patients are using cannabis in place of more dangerous drugs such as opiates and tranquilizers. This is a win for patients and the country as it is a far safer solution,"" she said. ""Medicinal cannabis has had a great impact, especially in paediatric patients with neurological pathologies, such as epilepsy and autism, and in patients with chronic pain. ""We always suggest putting patients in the centre of this process, giving them a voice, making them feel permanently accompanied and respected in their decision to incorporate this therapeutic alternative.""

The group is also seeking co-sponsorship from a Labor senator. NSW is currently investigating decriminalising medical cannabis. Senator Macdonald said his co-sponsorship of the bill did not necessarily mean he would support every clause of the bill in its current form. ""However, I think it is an important issue that the Parliament should have an opportunity to investigate, through debate in the Senate chamber, and through the Senate committee process,"" Senator Macdonald said in a statement. Senator Macdonald noted the recent LNP state council meeting in Townsville had passed motions supporting the federal parliamentary group's bill in order to allow medical trials of cannabis oil, and calling for such a trial to take place in Queensland. He said community attitudes to medicinal cannabis were evolving, and lawmakers needed to engage with the issue.

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 5 years ago Australia's cumbersome application system makes it difficult for patients  to access medicinal cannabis.  For the vast majority of Australian patients, medicinal cannabis is little more than a pipe dream and part of the problem lies with the all-too-conservative approach  that relies on specialist doctors. Those seeking medicinal cannabis in Australia must navigate a cumbersome application process, which requires going to a specialist physician not a GP. The result is that patients either go without or continue to use illicitly sourced products of unknown composition and safety. Seeing a specialist generally involves long waiting times and significant expense - and should you visit one seeking a green light for cannabis, thanks to recent government announcements, you will be most likely disappointed; they tend not to have been educated in the area of cannabis medicine and may well be skeptical and uncertain how to proceed. A new ""perspective piece"" by the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, published in the current issue of the Medical Journal of Australia, is unlikely to improve this situation. Rather than providing a coherent and balanced account of the current state of play, the “perspective” reads like a patronising and scaremongering diatribe, misrepresenting the literature to frighten off would-be prescribers. The RACP represents 25,000 specialists across Australasia and in 2016 formed a Medicinal Cannabis Reference Group to develop a position on the issue, this “perspective” piece being the Group’s first public output. Most egregious of its falsehoods is the statement that medicinal cannabis is no better than placebo in treating pain. Oddly, when asserting this claim, the published piece cites two authoritative recent reviews from the US - reviews that in fact concluded the opposite. This misrepresentation is no trivial issue. Some 20 per cent of Australians suffer chronic pain and surveys shows self-medication for back pain, arthritis and neuropathic pain are major drivers of illicit cannabis use in the Australian community. Those in unremitting pain are precisely the people who need their specialist doctors to have a nuanced and accurate knowledge of cannabinoid science. The perspective piece stokes concerns about increased cannabis-related hospital presentations in parts of the US that have legalised cannabis. What isn’t mentioned is that this largely reflects children consuming their parents’ cannabis recreational “edibles” like cannabis-infused chocolates. Also neglected is the fact that in parts of the US where medicinal cannabis is available, there has been a 25 per cent reduction in deaths due to prescription opioids, as well as a reduction in use of prescription drugs such as benzodiazepines and antidepressants. Deaths due to prescription opioids have declined in states where medicinal marijuana is available in the US.Credit:AP Cannabis is a drug that is used by more than 100 million people every year, none of whom die as a result. In contrast, prescription opioids alone resulted in the deaths of more than 40,000 Americans in 2016. The RACP perspective also cites the “known addictive” properties of cannabis. However, addiction specialists generally concede that cannabis is far less addictive than opioids and benzodiazepines. Even steroids and antidepressants have withdrawal effects during sudden discontinuation and these issues are routinely managed in clinical practice. Part of the complexity in the underlying science is that cannabis is actually hundreds of potential new medicines. THC is the psychoactive ingredient but there are hundreds of other bioactive molecules in the plant with potential therapeutic effects that do not intoxicate. One of these is cannabidiol (CBD), which the World Health Organisation recently concluded poses few risks to health and its use should not be restricted by governments - again, this critical development is not mentioned in the “perspective” piece. The RACP instead chooses to focus on reports of potential side effects of CBD in children given extremely large doses of CBD to treat severe epilepsy, which can be a life-threatening condition. We also know that these parents tend to turn to cannabis as a last resort, and the results can be positively transformative. The RACP perspective offers no empathy for the estimated 100,000-plus Australians self-medicating with illicit medicinal cannabis and it proposes no solution for bringing them into mainstream medicine, as has been achieved in Canada, Israel and the Netherlands. The RACP talks of a “precautionary principle” and “do no harm” - but in misrepresenting the facts of medicinal cannabis it promulgates a great deal of harm. Our own recent work with GPs suggests many would like to be able to prescribe, given sufficient training, and that they feel disenfranchised by the specialist-only system. Rumblings from Canberra - that regime change might indeed bring GPs into a new system where they act as medicinal cannabis gatekeepers - could be just what the doctor ordered. After all, if GPs are entrusted to prescribe opiates and benzodiazepines, why not medicinal cannabis products?

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 7 years ago Ian Freckelton's extensive report for the Law Reform Commission, recommending the legalisation of cannabis for medicinal use, is a welcome and refreshing approach to a complex issue. The challenge is this: if cannabis alleviates pain or suffering for some people, but its medical efficacy is not conclusively proved, how might a compassionate government frame laws and devise a supply scheme to ensure patients with the worst conditions could have safe, regular and equitable access to this otherwise prohibited drug? Dr Freckelton, QC, has proposed a system whereby patients with acute conditions, under the close supervision of their medical specialists, could be prescribed cannabis-based remedies, which would be purchased at pharmacies. The Andrews government has embraced the plan, agreeing to adopt all the Law Reform Commission's recommendations (albeit, two of them will be phased in). It is expected to introduce legislation in December and, if federal Health Minister Sussan Ley gives her assent, Victoria would have an operational scheme by January 2017 – the first state to introduce a regulated scheme for cultivating, processing and prescribing cannabis-based medicine. This is a big development in alternative therapies in Australia, and it follows similar but flawed schemes in Canada, where the system has proved too rigid and bureaucratic, and in 23 American states, where it has been vulnerable to abuse. The Netherlands and Israel also allow medicinal cannabis. Some medical experts believe it is premature for the government to permit cannabis in a medicinal form, because while there is emerging evidence suggesting it is effective in treating certain conditions, there is not conclusive proof. It has therapeutic potential, but many more rigorous studies are needed to demonstrate efficacy. Only one pharmaceutical-grade instance of cannabis-based medicine has passed the high standards demanded by the Therapeutic Goods Administration: Siritex, in 2012. But it was not released here because, after failing to get the product listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the manufacturer decided Siritex would not be financially viable in Australia. It should be noted that Dr Freckelton recognises cannabis is not a medical panacea; it is not a miracle ""cure"", as some wildly optimistic advocates suggest. But, when administered as an edible oil, it has been used with some success in easing the frequent and devastating seizures experienced by children with chronic epilepsy and alleviating muscle spasms related to multiple sclerosis. Others say it relieves their chronic, serious pain. Dr Freckelton stresses the importance of having patients' use of cannabis seamlessly integrated with their medical treatment. Patients should be properly monitored and supervised by a specialist; access to recommended cannabis-based remedies should not be more difficult than regular prescription medications; the quality of the cannabis should be consistent; and any potential product must be in a non-smokable form. Pain management is a vital aspect of modern medicine. Indeed, some of the most prestigious universities have entire departments devoted to researching pain and developing pain therapies. Improving the quality of life, by easing pain and suffering, is one of the most valued duties of a doctor. The Age believes this proposal is appropriately pragmatic and properly balanced. Although the scientific evidence for cannabis's efficacy falls short, there are sound reasons, based on compassion, for allowing such remedies to be made available, under supervision, to patients suffering certain acute and chronic conditions.

Dr David Caldicott says there could be ""unintended consequences"" of the codeine ban, as he calls for medicinal marijuana to be used for chronic pain reliefCredit:Melissa Adams Dr Caldicott said while codeine was not an ideal drug, there was no clear plan to provide alternatives for regular users of over-the-counter codeine. ""I don't expect the withdrawal of codeine from the market will be without its unintended consequences,"" he said Dr Caldicott said Australia's treatment of pain has been largely under the influence of the pharmaceutical industry He said US states that introduced medicinal cannabis for pain relief saw drops in the prescribing of opioids and their associated deaths and overdoses. ""Patients are taking themselves off the opioids and the benzos because they are getting the same effect from a product that is far safer,"" Dr Caldicott said. He said the fentanyl crisis in the US - when people turned to the drug when other opioids became harder to access - provided some insight into what could happen when access to a drug was suddenly cut off He said he was concerned that making access to codeine or other opiates harder, Australians will also find a way to replace their opiates. Dr Caldicott said it was not clear what a treating doctor should do when presented with a patient wanting to access codeine. ""People say this is a great initiative, but I see it as the medical profession commencing its atonement for a tremendous error of over-prescribing,"" he said. ""But the pain is real and other alternatives have to be made available to address this issue. ""It's just a little bit bizarre the most obvious intervention we could make is medicinal cannabis, which pretty much every country across the world is doing, but we are still dithering with it.""

She said there were many people who suffered from conditions such as migraines, endometritis and period pain who relied on easy access to low-dose codeine to attend work and complete daily tasks. ""What they're just having a dream, they're imagining it works?"" Dr Wales said. Dr Wales said people had been stockpiling drugs and will get panicky as that stockpile comes to an end and concerned doctors - under pressure to prescribe less opioids - would not prescribe them anything if they attend. She said she was concerned people would be forced to consider black market alternatives. ""Some patients are saying it's just going to go underground,"" Dr Wales said. ""It could spawn a whole other market which is just unseen. ""Some patients are saying they will take whatever's in their cupboard."" But acting ACT Chief Health Officer Dr Paul Dugdale denied GPs, hospitals or patients would be under pressure due to the changes. He said there were better over the counter options to low-dose codeine, including paracetamol and ibuprofen, and urged regular users of over the counter codeine products to see their GPs to come up with a treatment plan. ""Low dose codeine has been widely used for pain relief. There is growing evidence that the harms arising from over‑the‑counter codeine use and misuse substantially outweigh the benefits,"" Dr Dugdale said. Canberra pharmacist Ben Gilbert, from Capital Chemist University of Canberra, said there had been a wide range of responses from customers finding out about the changes. ""People who don't have easy access to a GP are a bit lost, so we've been trying to hook them up,"" he said. He said most codeine products have been unavailable for a number of weeks or months after it ceased being manufactured and stock ran out. Copyright © 2023",12,764

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 5 years ago A world-first trial has received federal funding and within a matter of months, Queensland researchers hope to start investigating the symptom relief medicinal cannabis can provide to cancer patients receiving palliative care. The trial will test several combinations of medicinal cannabinoids, natural products of the cannabis plant, to see which symptoms can be targeted and which variety of cannabinoids provides the most effective relief for just more than 200 terminally ill south-east Queensland patients. The Mater Research Institute and University of Queensland are leading a world-first medicinal cannabis trial, set to begin later this year. Mater Research Institute and University of Queensland researcher Professor Janet Hardy, who is leading the trial, said the four-year funding came from the Medical Research Future Fund, which is designed to support clinical trials for rare diseases and unmet medical needs. ""This is the first trial with a holistic patient approach, trying to address all of the symptoms to see if we can reduce the burden,"" Professor Hardy said. The two types of cannabinoids to be trialled were tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC gives users ""the high"" and CBD is most beneficial as an anti-inflammatory, according to Professor Hardy. The trial will test different combinations and doses of the two cannabinoids to determine which mixture achieves the most effective pain relief and ""feel-good"" factor. ""The trouble at the moment is that nobody knows what to prescribe, how to prescribe it, what dose to give or what patients will benefit the most,"" Professor Hardy said. ""These are the questions we hope to answer through this trial. Professor Janet HardyCredit:Mater Research “Cannabis, the plant, contains more than 100 different cannabinoids but we don’t know which one or combination of these, if any, will be best for the symptomatic relief of this patient group.” As the medical director of Mater Cancer Care Centre, Professor Hardy noted the strong interest from patients. “There has certainly been an overwhelming interest in the use of medicinal cannabinoids, particularly for the relief of symptom distress in palliative care patients,"" she said. “A large number of patients who come to us in clinic ask for cannabis, due to the public perception around its beneficial effects.” It was hoped the trial could start in about three months time. “Patients participating in the trial will be asked to score a range of symptoms including pain, nausea, appetite, bowel function, anxiety and depression,"" Professor Hardy said. ""The primary outcome we are assessing is their ‘total symptom score’ representing their symptom burden."" Copyright © 2023",11,441

Opposition leader John Robertson said the terminally ill who wanted to use cannabis for pain relief ""should not suffer the further humiliation of being dragged through our courts and treated as criminals"". ""Labor's position would see the law change to provide this small group of people with the protections they need,"" he said. Labor supports two key recommendations of the select committee into the use of cannabis for medical purposes, which reported in May last year. One was that the government amend the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act to add ""a complete defence"" to the use and possession of cannabis to cover its use for medicinal purposes by the terminally ill and those with AIDS. The other was that a register of ""authorised cannabis patients and carers"" should be established and run by the NSW Ministry of Health. They would be issued with photo identification stating they are exempt from arrest and prosecution. A committee member, upper house Labor MP Adam Searle, said the issue was ""not about drug law reform"".

This was published 8 years ago After a week of political announcements, Victorians who believe in the healing powers of marijuana feel no closer to sourcing the drug legally and say they will continue to risk prosecution for buying questionable products on the black market.  In response to growing calls for cannabis to be legalised for people with some medical conditions, Opposition Leader Daniel Andrews last week made an election promise to seek advice from the Victorian Law Reform Commission on how people ""in exceptional circumstances"" could access the drug. Tom Kies has been using cannibis oil and chewing gum in a bid to treat his cancer.Credit:Justin McManus The commission would be asked to report back on how the prescription, manufacture and distribution of medical cannabis could be regulated by August next year. While the plan opens up the possibility of approved people growing their own cannabis or being protected from criminal charges for possessing it, Health Minister David Davis said he would only allow more clinical trials of cannabis-based pharmaceuticals. This is how Sativex – a cannabis-derived mouth spray that has been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for people with multiple sclerosis – became available in Australia. This path generally relies on pharmaceutical companies identifying a market for a product and believing the investment in lengthy clinical trials and regulatory approval processes is worthwhile. Many doctors say there is considerable evidence that cannabinoid molecules – there are more than 120 and only one, THC, gets people ""stoned"" – can relieve pain, stimulate appetite, control nausea and alleviate muscle spasticity, and there is growing proof they can treat seizures. Some say they may even lead to new cancer and obesity treatments.  This has prompted the Netherlands, Israel, Canada and Spain to decriminalise cannabis for medical purposes. It is also available for prescription in more than 20 US states.  Melbourne mother Cassie Batten, who has been buying cannabis oil on the black market to treat her son Cooper's intractable epileptic seizures, said while both the Labor and Coalition plans sounded progressive, they would not allow her to legally buy her son's medication any time soon. Last month, police seized vials of Cooper's oil, but no charges have been laid. Ms Batten said it was ridiculous that she had to rely on various illegal channels to get the drug, without any reassurance of its quality. She said one Melbourne hospital had even allowed it to be used and put it on Cooper's drug charts. ""Nothing is going to happen urgently with either party and Cooper doesn't have time to wait,"" she said. ""We need action now.""   Tom Kies, a 32-year-old trained lawyer with terminal cancer, has also found himself risking prosecution for importing cannabidiol (CBD) – a compound that does not cause a ""high"" – to see if it will slow or stop the growth of his tumours. Since being told there were no more medical treatments for him, Mr Kies said he started researching experimental options, including CBD.  While he remains sceptical about the low-level evidence in animals that suggests it can treat cancer, he says a willingness to try anything that might prolong his life led him to order oil and CBD-based chewing gum over the internet. Both arrived in the mail, but a second $2500 order of cannabis oil has since been held up in customs.  Mr Kies said he was disappointed he may not get the oil and said governments should be doing more to maturely assess the medical potential of cannabis in ""a rational and less emotional"" way. He said they also had a responsibility to protect people from the harm of questionable black market drugs.  ""People are going to drug dealers and getting a product that isn't what they are paying for, or isn't of the quality that will help them,"" he said. ""That's a huge problem and that's where the dangers come into play, especially if people are giving it to their children."" Copyright © 2023",11,678

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. Examine, a free weekly newsletter covering science with a sceptical, evidence-based eye, is sent every Tuesday. Below is an excerpt – sign up to get the whole newsletter in your inbox. We’re going to try something new, and possibly quite dangerous, in Examine this week: predictions. After speaking to a range of top scientists across Australia, here are four big things I reckon will shape the year in science. We’ll come back to this list at the end of the year to see if I got it right! Let me give you a sense of the state of medical cannabis in two news bites. Workers pack medical cannabis, at UNIVO Pharmaceuticals in Israel.Credit:AP The first is from a company called Levin Health, which has signed up a bevy of A-list sports talents to promote its medical cannabis business; AFL coaches Chris Scott and Damien Hardwick, rugby’s Andrew Johns and basketballer Lauren Jackson are joining forces “to break down the stigma around medicinal cannabis”. The other news bite comes from the Australian Pain Society’s annual scientific meeting, which held a session called, “Is medicinal cannabis the next opioid crisis waiting to happen?” I suspect medicinal cannabis could be the thin edge of the wedge that is being used by some to achieve a larger goal: cannabis legalisation. After the Legalise Cannabis Party picked up two seats in Victoria’s upper house late last year, we can expect this barrow to be pushed even harder. Here’s my concern: “Medical cannabis” is a very different concept to “legal cannabis”. A vast and powerful medical cannabis industry now operates in America and Australia, pushing a product that is rapidly growing in use – prescriptions are up 50 per cent since 2020 – yet there is little rigorous scientific evidence to support it. There may be good arguments for legalising a drug that seems far less harmful than alcohol. But instead of focusing on that, the industry and government are focused on a “medicine” that has little or no evidence base. I suspect things will only ramp up this year. New governments get a honeymoon period, and Australia’s new science minister, Ed Husic, got an extra long one. The replacement of a Coalition government at open war with universities and scientists had many breathing a sigh of relief. Ed Husic, Minister for Industry and Science.Credit:Wolter Peeters Year two has now arrived. Husic has said all the right things, but scientists want to see action now. “We have been in crisis mode for so long,” one tells me. “Everyone is anxious to see the money,” says another. But will the government inject real funding into a “starving” system? Given the treasurer keeps talking about how tight the budget is, I am sceptical. More likely, I suspect, it will tinker with the system. The big policy shapers are likely to be the review of the Australian Research Council, a key funder of Australian science that has become increasingly mired in bureaucracy, and a review of the nation’s universities. Pressure is mounting on the government to cut the national interest test and the ministerial veto, two instruments that seem to serve chiefly to irritate researchers. But does the government have the stomach for bigger reforms, such as restructuring how universities fund research? Relying on fees from international students seems unsustainable. Could the Australian Research Council’s budget be retargeted towards discovery research? Could our many pots of funding, some of which seem to function entirely at the whim of the minister, be centralised and better run? Husic is known to be deeply interested in quantum research, in which Australia once led the world and still retains a strong capacity. More focus here could reap rich rewards. So far, the minister has shown himself willing to tackle problems head-on rather than sweeping them under the rug, as demonstrated by his commendable and much-needed review of (floundering) government-funded efforts to increase the number of women in STEM areas. Let’s hope that attitude continues. The good news first: researchers and the media remain focused on long COVID; a recently published review in Nature has already attracted almost half a million views and huge news coverage. There are several interesting high-quality trials being done, such as Australia’s STRONGER trial, which is testing the use of statins. America’s National Institutes of Health has more than $US1 billion to do research. That level of investment is extraordinary for a post-viral illness, one in an area which has been neglected for far too long. If there are discoveries and treatments to be found, we now stand a decent chance of finding them. The attention and research should have flow-on benefits to other post-viral illnesses such as chronic fatigue syndrome. Lulu, 11, has long COVID. Can we do a better job taking care of people like her?Credit:Jason South Now the bad news: care for the hundreds of thousands of Australians with long COVID seems unlikely to improve much. Australia’s long-COVID inquiry looks set to push for a GP-led care system – essentially shifting the cost of long COVID onto an already-stretched Medicare budget and GP workforce. Expect a fight here, as the federal government tries to shift responsibility towards hospitals, which the states pay for. Can we increase GPs’ skills fast enough to provide quality care? Many long COVID patients are already finding GPs pose more of a problem than a solution. The states, meanwhile, say they can’t afford to pay for the additional care burden or, extraordinarily, that they don’t have much long COVID. Meanwhile, I’m hearing of existing clinics already looking at closing after the government’s COVID healthcare funding was slashed. This could get ugly. Last year, there was a debut of publicly funded gene therapies in Australia. These new drugs, which change the way our DNA is expressed, can do extraordinary things, such as treat a child with spinal muscular atrophy, the leading genetic cause of infant death. Rather than dying, these kids are walking. And there are many more similar gene therapies coming. “This is the start of a new era of medicine,” Professor John Rasko, head of gene therapy at the Centenary Institute and author of a book about the history of stem cell medicine, told me last year. RNA also continues to excite. Moderna’s mRNA vaccine for melanoma is showing promise in clinical trials, as is the company’s RSV vaccine. I’ll be watching this space closely. “It’s not hype – the technology is amazing,” Monash University’s Associate Professor Traude Beilharz says. “It’s going to be incredibly expensive. But the promise is enormous.” She’s right – on both counts. Australian bio-giant CSL now owns the most expensive drug in the world: a gene therapy for haemophilia B that costs $US 3.5 million (nearly $5 million) per treatment. It will come up for approval in Australia this year, raising big questions for governments about how we pay for these super pricey new drugs. The answer will be hard: this is a country that has form in choosing not to pay for a life-saving childhood vaccine because it costs too much per life saved. Enjoyed this article?

Professor Milton Cohen, director of professional affairs for the Australian New Zealand College of Anaesthetist's (ANZCA) faculty of pain medicine, says current evidence in support of medicinal cannabis is ""not good enough"". Jeremy Hayllar, an expert in addiction medicine from Brisbane ""The question of evidence, I think, hangs in the air much like some smoke,"" he told a meeting of Australian pain specialists in Brisbane on Saturday.

An expert in chronic pain will tell a Brisbane conference that cannabis is no 'magic pill'.Credit:The Age Victoria became Australia's first state to legalise cannabis for medical use and was quickly followed by NSW. Under amendments to the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods regulations, cannabis-based medications are available to a range of people for whom more mainstream treatments are not effective. This has left physicians treating patients with chronic pain in an ""untenable"" situation, Professor Cohen told the meeting. ""We are told that cannabinoids might work, surely we need to know that it does work. Professor Milton Cohen, director of professional affairs for the Australian New Zealand College of Anaesthetist's faculty of pain medicine. ""I don't think we are in the position to say with confidence to the community that this is the case."" Chronic pain affects about one in five people in Australia and New Zealand. It is a complex issue and the very ""modest"" benefits medical cannabis may provide have been ""oversold"" to the public, Professor Cohen said. ""We know that chronic pain is a much more complex phenomenon which requires a holistic approach to management that is tailored to the individual's circumstances. To rely only on medicines is just not going to work,"" Professor Cohen said. The faculty does not support the use of cannabinoids in chronic non-cancer pain ""until such time as a clear therapeutic role for them is identified in the scientific literature"". ​Jeremy Hayllar, an expert in addiction medicine from Brisbane, says the faculty's position is ""sensible and cautious"" but medicinal cannabis is potentially a safer option to treating chronic pain. Dr Hayllar told the ANZCA scientific conference there was no denying medicinal cannabis use had resulted in a drop in opioid-related deaths in the US. ""It's hard to dismiss that evidence,"" Dr Hayllar said. The number of pharmaceutical opioid-related deaths during the past 10 years has increased significantly. According to the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, 800 Australians die a year as a result of overdose from prescription painkillers. ""The medicinal cannabis genie is out of the bottle. Things will never be quite the same. Should we not accept a level of uncertainty about evidence?"" Dr Hayllar said. Copyright © 2023",9,509

""We are behind the times on medical cannabis,"" writes David Penington, an emeritus professor at Melbourne University, in a paper in the Medical Journal of Australia on Sunday. Emeritus Professor David Penington says Australia is behind the times on the medical use of cannabis.Credit:Simon Schluter ""Twenty three states in the US have legalised use of cannabis for medical conditions, as has Canada since 2001. Other countries approving it include Israel, Holland and the Czech Republic."" Dr Penington, a public health and medicinal marijuana advocate, was named the 2014 Victorian of the Year. Under the terms of a clinical trial unveiled last year, the Baird government will run a trial of clinical cannabis for approved conditions including pain associated with terminal illness, children with intractable epilepsy and chemotherapy-related nausea. Trials are expected to start next year.  Under the terms of the trial one group of patients will be treated with a placebo and one with active cannabis preparations. The progress of the two groups will be compared.  But Dr Penington says the government should approve use of medicinal cannabis now, pointing to a study showing 76 per cent of readers of one medical journal recommend cannabis be prescribed for cancer patients. He further argues that the mechanics of running a double-blind study are not appropriate for patients, particularly those in extreme pain. ""Cannabis as such cannot be subjected to a double blind clinical trial,"" they write. ""If a person in the late stages of painful cancer seeks the euphoria of THC, why should they not have it? ""Participants in the control group may demand to transfer to the active arm on seeing others feeling better."" The government is examining options to import cannabis for the trial, or have it grown under controlled conditions by contract from the government. But Dr Penington says patients who register with the government should instead be allowed to grow up to 10 of their own plants to establish a supply. He notes it could still take several years to conduct trials of pharmaceutical cannabis compounds for epilepsy.  The state's Opposition Leader, Luke Foley, has announced that he favours moving directly to legalisation of medical marijuana. John Kaye, from the NSW Greens, also advocates snap legalisation and introduced a bill to parliament that would allow patients suffering a range of conditions to grow up to six of their own plants.

The 54-year-old has given three months notice in a shock move that will cause the organisation to redefine its role in the football landscape. Brayshaw took on the job after Danny Frawley, who died in 2019, stood down in 2014 as the association grappled with the fall-out from the Essendon supplements scandal and its role in supporting coaches. Mark Brayshaw, right, has resigned from the AFL Coaches Association. Credit:The Age In Brayshaw's time the association, which began in 2002, became a respected voice on issues affecting coaches, from rule changes to health and wellbeing as well as contracts. He was a candidate for the North Melbourne CEO job that Ben Amarfio eventually won and his three boys, Angus, Andrew and Hamish, have all been on AFL lists, with Angus and Andrew high-profile midfielders at Melbourne and Fremantle. However, the coronavirus pandemic led to an upheaval in football departments with clubs standing down coaching staff and the AFL leading a narrative that claimed the game was poorer due to the proliferation of coaches. The AFL also cut the football department cap from$9.7 million to $6.2 million a year in 2021, which led to many coaches leaving or seeking work in football at the community level and some disquiet with the league's regard for the coaching role. In a statement Brayshaw said he had loved the job he held for six years. ""The coaches have inspired me with their work ethic, empathy and candour. I’m lost in admiration for the role they play in our game and have been very grateful for the support I’ve received from them and this wonderful industry,"" Brayshaw said. After such a tumultuous year, in which Rhyce Shaw parted ways with North Melbourne for personal reasons, and the personal lives of respected coaches making headlines, senior coaches such as Hawthorn's Alastair Clarkson have expressed concern about the future of the profession. The AFLCA will canvass members before beginning their search in February with Brayshaw to remain in the position until April. Copyright © 2023",10,386

This was published 6 years ago Families will have to wait until early 2017 for medicinal cannabis, despite new Victorian laws being passed to legalise the treatment. And those that cannot afford newly legal medicinal cannabis will be given nearly $12 million in taxpayer-funded assistance to buy the drug, Premier Daniel Andrews says. Families that cannot afford medicinal cannabis will be able to access an $11.8 million fund.  Secret government-run drug labs have started growing medicinal cannabis in Victoria to provide new treatment for nearly 500 children. Last week the government passed laws for medicinal cannabis but people seeking the treatment - it will require a prescription - will have to wait until next year when the government-controlled product becomes available. The government warned that people getting treatments from other sources was illegal and would be a matter for the police. Medicinal cannabis will initially only be available to an estimated 470 children suffering various conditions, including severe epilepsy.  Mr Andrews on Tuesday announced that next Wednesday's state budget would include $28.5 million to set up the office of Medicinal Cannabis and an independent medical advisory committee. The government said  treatment costs were not known yet but Mr Andrews indicated that he would talk to the Commonwealth about getting medicinal cannabis on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Previous reports have estimated the treatment would cost $50-$58 a month from selected pharmacists. $11.8 million of next week's budget will go to a hardship fund for families that cannot afford the new medicinal treatment. ""Anyone who faces a sick child or sick family member is going to have a really profound impact on how much money you've got and this hardship fund is all about trying to deal with that. We don't want cost to be a barrier,"" Mr Andrews said.   Inside Victoria's secret medicinal cannabis lab Trials over the coming months will see experts refine and test plants at an indoor ""very secure"" facility to get the best product for the first cohort of child patients early next year. The government will cultivate the cannabis which will then be manufactured at a public hospital, before the industry is expanded for other patient groups. Other adult patients suffering from Multiple Sclerosis, some forms of cancer and HIV/AIDS, will be given access to the drug at a later stage. Once set up people will only be able to buy the treatment, with a prescription, from government sanctioned suppliers. The first round of medicinal cannabis samples  ""We are absolutely on track to be providing a safe reliable secure and legal product,"" Agriculture Minister Jaala Pulford said. By next year Victoria will be well advanced in creating a new commercial industry, and other states have expressed interest in what Victoria is doing, including supply. ""There is certainly is potential for a very significant industry out of this, [but] that is not the primary focus, the primary focus is of course care,"" Mr Andrews said. Copyright © 2023",11,507

This was published 8 years ago Pharmaceutical cannabis is effective for treating some forms of pain, reducing nausea and helping people gain weight, but there are barriers to medical use in Australia, the federal government's principal drug advisory group says.   An Australian National Council on Drugs' report on medicinal cannabis published on Monday said research suggested a number of cannabis pharmaceuticals could treat pain, particularly chronic and neuropathic pain, the latter of which is caused by injuries to the nervous system.  Damian Zammit, with wife Nancy, daughter Jessica and Imogen, who suffers from Dravet syndrome.Credit:Luis Enrique Ascui The background and information paper said clinical trials of various cannabinoids had also shown they could treat spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis and stimulate appetite and weight gain in people with HIV, advanced cancer and anorexia.  While cannabinoids may be able to treat epilepsy, glaucoma, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, Tourette's syndrome and spinal cord injuries, the report said the evidence for its use in these conditions was less clear.  The analysis, which aimed to identify areas that require ""further action or investigation"", comes amid growing calls for medicinal cannabis to be legalised in Australia. On Sunday, Victorian Opposition Leader Daniel Andrews said that if he was elected in November, he would ask the Victorian Law Reform Commission to report on how the prescription manufacture and distribution of medical cannabis could be legalised.  The ANCD report said while three medical cannabis products had been developed, only one of them - Sativex - had been approved for use by the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia to treat multiple sclerosis. Some Australian cancer patients are also part of a global trial of Sativex to see if it relieves difficult-to-treat cancer pain. The trial is expected to continue for another year.  The ANCD report said that while pharmaceutical companies could continue to apply for cannabis products to be used for particular conditions, approval takes a ""significant length of time"" and Australia's small market for such products may not offer sufficient incentive to manufacturers. Furthermore, it said Sativex cost about $500 per month in 2013, suggesting that some people would opt for cheaper ""crude cannabis"" unless it was listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.  It said while arguments for enabling crude cannabis (herbal cannabis) could thus be made on the basis of easier manufacture and lower costs, this raised legal and regulatory complexities. Few clinical trials had also tested it and there were concerns about the health risks associated with its administration, especially if smoked, for example. On Monday, Damian Zammit, of Croydon Hills in Melbourne, welcomed more debate about medicinal cannabis. Mr Zammit's 10-year-old daughter, Imogen, has Dravet syndrome, and the family have tried more than a dozen medications to treat her severe seizures, largely without success. Since seeing other families successfully use cannabis oil to treat seizures in children with Dravet syndrome, the Zammits have wanted to see if it could help Imogen. But they have no access to the drug, and even if they were able to source it, have fears that obtaining it illegally could endanger the job of Imogen's mother Nancy, a schoolteacher. Mr Zammit said on Monday that he was pleased that the medicinal potential of cannabis was receiving attention, and would be interested in the Victorian Liberal Party's position and the outcome of Victorian Labor's push toward decriminalisation. ""I'm a bit sceptical until it actually happens,"" Mr Zammit said. Greens senator Richard Di Natale said he welcomed action by state MPs, but a federal response was needed. ""No matter what Victoria does, cannabis will remain illegal,"" he said. ""People will need to meet dealers to source their medicine. They shouldn't have to do that."" Senator Di Natale said he was preparing legislation to change the scheduling of cannabis so that it was no longer classified as an illicit drug, and to provide a framework for licensing growers and dispensaries. A spokeswoman for the Commonwealth government said: ""Decriminalisation of personal use of cannabis where there are clear compassionate circumstances is an option which state and territory governments can pursue under their respective drugs and poisons control legislation should they choose to do so.""

Inside Victoria's secret medicinal cannabis facility ""There will be farmers in different parts of the state that will be interested in trying it.

The company will eventually manufacture synthetics, patches and tablets for both medicinal and recreational use. The drug is used to treat terminally ill patients, children with epilepsy, and cancer patients suffering from chemotherapy-related nausea. ""Uruguay is the first nation in the world to legalise the production and sale of non-synthetic cannabis products and Winter Garden has fully entrenched its first-mover advantage with the rapid submission and approval of these licenses,"" Mr Tasker said ""The approval by the Uruguayan government can also be seen as a strong commitment by local authorities to help develop new products and intellectual property in this fledgling industry."" Mr Tasker said Winter Garden would be one of the first allowed to cultivate hemp ""without the cumbersome and limiting restrictions on THC and cannabinoid content"". ""It will provide Winter Garden with significant advantages moving forward as it will allow the company to be amongst the first producers in the world to plant high value, multi-purpose crops in the only jurisdiction to allow the actual registration and patenting of products and processes using these proprietary genetics,"" he said. ""Winter Garden will now move to a commercial grow out and registration program with a significant number of negotiating parties who have been waiting for Winter Garden to commence its commercial agricultural and laboratory operations."" The company will initially plant seven hectares of cannabis, but is expected to have planted 50 hectares within six months. IGS says it has been estimated Winter Garden could rake in between US$550,000 to US$600,000 per hectare. Earlier this year, another WA-based company with involvement in medicinal marijuana, Phytotech, made waves on its stockmarket debut. Phytotech was seeking to break into the medicinal marijuana industry in the US. Locally, however, the Barnett government has backed away from supporting medicinal cannabis trials.

Speaking about the ""heartbreaking"" lives of children such as seven-year-old Tyler Oldenburg, she added the investment would benefit some of the state's most vulnerable patients. Tyler, from Greystanes, has up to 40 seizures a day, from those that last a few seconds to ""grand mal"" episodes that last up to 90 minutes.

Dr Lawson added the medicines do not come without risks and underlined that the compounds in medicinal cannabis are not the same as those found in street cannabis. Carol Ireland, of Epilepsy Action Australia, said the breakthrough had come after five years of campaigning and that Australia was well behind the US in the field of medical cannabis use.

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 4 years ago The rational response to research suggesting medical cannabis fails to alleviate chronic pain is, well, to not use medical cannabis to alleviate chronic pain. Given some promising results in studies of the drug’s effectiveness at salving a number of ailments, it had been hoped it might prove a potent pain reliever – and a much safer one than synthetic opioids, which have been a leading cause of preventable death. But one of the most comprehensive studies yet done on the pot’s potential found it does not cut pain and seems to increase the overall anxiety levels of patients. But the findings, published in Lancet Public Health, do not mean medical cannabis does not merit a place in the treatment of various other ailments. Governments throughout the world, including all Australia’s states and territories, have legislated to allow doctors to prescribe, under stringent conditions, medical marijuana, which has been found by some research to alleviate suffering associated with childhood epilepsy, chemotherapy and multiple sclerosis. More research is needed into medical benefits of cannabis.Credit:Melissa McDonald This form of the drug contains very little of the primary psychoactive compound that makes recreational and medicinal use so widespread. Medicinal use has been reported to help relieve the discomfort of many unwell people. (Medical use is regulated and included in the health system; medicinal use may or may not be legal, depending on jurisdiction, and is associated with the tendency of some plants or compounds to relieve some forms of suffering.) More study is required on health benefits many believe cannabis offers. But all drugs carry, too, risk. Taking any such substances is an adult decision; brains are forming until well into a person’s 20s. And those of any age with a predisposition to psychosis are particularly vulnerable to drug-altered consciousness. Clearly, some medical and social due diligence has been provided to governments across the world that have opted for the decriminalisation and regulation of cannabis for medical use - and in many places also for medicinal and recreational use. The US is a conservative nation; the majority of its states permit medical and/or recreational cannabis. Such legislation requires careful debate, and we are not calling for legal recreational use of marijuana in Victoria. We acknowledge that many lawmakers feel that rational analysis suggests people should have the liberty to use marijuana. Outlawing it, such proponents point out, creates a criminal, uncontrolled market and wastes scarce law-enforcement resources. The drugs that are the biggest killers are legal (and provide bountiful tax revenue to governments) – tobacco, alcohol and prescription painkillers.But we call on the advocates of marijuana use not to overstate the drug’s medical benefits, generating false hope among the unwell, as a way of speeding up its legal use. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews should not let the Lancet study dull his desire to provide effective, safe options. A blanket rejection of medical cannabis on the basis of its unsuitability to the relief of chronic pain would be irrational. But more research must be done into the claims of its benefits, for the results so far are inconclusive.  Copyright © 2023",9,538

""What we are trying to do is work with the medical profession to inform them about this,"" he said, adding there had been a cannabis symposium earlier this year to educate researchers and healthcare professionals about the new guidelines.  ""I think one of the challenges we've got is that there are mixed views, as you'd probably understand and acknowledge, within the medical profession about the use of medicinal cannabis.

Dr Boyd also pointed out there was widespread use of various products, such as apple cider vinegar, pear juice and turmeric, with claims of their therapeutic benefits.

This was published 8 years ago The federal government would be given oversight over the production and distribution of medical cannabis under new legislation to make the make the drug available to patients with chronic pain. The push to legalise medical cannabis is gathering pace, with Greens Senator Richard Di Natale, chairman of the cross-party Parliamentary Group for Drug Policy and Law Reform, now finalising a bill that is set to be introduced into Parliament next month. Supporters of legalised medical cannabis have been buoyed by Prime Minister Tony Abbott's strong public support for the legalisation of the drug for medical use. ""I have no problem with the medical use of cannabis, just as I have no problem with the medical use of opiates,"" Mr Abbott wrote in a letter to 2GB radio host Alan Jones, dated August 23. ""If a drug is needed for a valid medicinal purpose … and is being administered safely there should be no question of its legality."" Jones, who has been campaigning in support of medical cannabis, read Mr Abbott's letter on air earlier this month. Senator Di Natale, a former GP, is also pushing for the Therapeutic Goods Administration to create a special category for the drug so that it can be available with a doctor's prescription. The TGA currently lists cannabis as a prohibited substance. Senator Di Natale said his bill would cover the licensing of cannabis growers, quality control standards and how the drug should be processed and distributed. The regime would mirror the regulation of the cultivation of poppies for use in medical opiates. Senator Di Natale said he favoured the creation of a new independent statutory authority to regulate the drug, but that the Department of Health could also serve this role. ""I am open to any discussions with the Prime Minister's office to maximise the chance of success,"" he said. Medical cannabis can be used to alleviate pain and treat nausea – including for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and for people with multiple sclerosis. Following a campaign on behalf of terminally ill Tamworth man Daniel Haslam, the NSW government announced a clinical trial of medical cannabis earlier this month.  Victorian federal Liberal MP Sharman Stone said: ""We can put in place mechanisms to ensure that medical cannabis is properly regulated without leaking into the illicit drug market. It has worked in places such as Canada and Israel.  ""I think this has support among many people in the Coalition party room."" Liberal Democrat Senator David Leyonhjelm said he would vote for the legalisation of medical cannabis, but that the drug should also be made legal for recreational use.  ""The Greens are very timid on this issue,"" he said. ""The problem with the legalisation of medical cannabis is you have to have a whole regime established to restrict it to medical use; you have to get TGA approval. Drug companies do not want to invest in clinical trials. It's hugely complex. If you limit it to medical use everyone will be claiming to be sick."" In a statement on its website, the Department of Health says: ""For any form of cannabis to be approved for medicinal use in Australia an application needs to be made to the Therapeutic Goods Administration with supporting data to assess its quality, safety and efficacy,"" ""The government cannot compel a sponsor to make an application to the TGA and decisions are made independent of ministerial involvement."" The TGA has approved the use of Sativex, a mouth spray derived from cannabis. A spokesman for Health Minister Peter Dutton did not respond to requests for comment. Alex Wodak, former director of the Alcohol and Drug Service at Sydney's St Vincent's Hospital, said he supported the creation of an Office of Medicinal Cannabis. ""The political obstacles are diminishing by the minute so tackling the regulatory obstacles are critical,"" he said.

Five years on, he’s become an international cannabis mogul. By Amanda Hooton At 73, Barry Lambert listed his cannabis company Ecofibre on the Australian Stock Exchange.Credit:Louie Douvis/John Shakespeare Barry Lambert’s cannabis company Ecofibre is launched on the Australian Stock Exchange on a bright autumn day in Sydney. This is the first ASX listing I’ve attended, so I’m not sure how typical it is. But at about the point I find myself listening to Lambert’s son Michael talk about his sperm, it strikes me that this might not be a totally conventional event. Lambert’s wife Joy appears, looking exasperated. “Oh, Michael, stop blaming yourself,” she says to her son. “It’s nobody’s fault.” Looking around, I note several tall, extremely confident-looking men in suits, whom I presume to be the kinds of titans of industry who regularly attend ASX listings. But there is also a surprising number of children, ranging from a little girl with enormous brown eyes, to various teenagers with long sweeps of glossy hair. Are children normal at such events? What about all these Americans? Scientists, pharmacists, executives. The brown-eyed child rings the ASX bell; someone smashes a glass; Michael Lambert buttonholes a group of polite people from Philadelphia. Their eyes widen as he speaks. At a restaurant reception following the launch, people drink French champagne while musician Johnny Diesel (an Ecofibre investor) plays an acoustic number beside a potted plant. The titans of industry engage me one-by-one, dazzlingly keen to talk, albeit off the record and without telling me their names. One says he invested in Ecofibre after supplying “the product” to half a dozen mates on a surfing trip. Someone else invested “because I take the product myself”. In the midst of these curious exchanges, I catch sight of Barry Lambert. He is, without a doubt, the most straightforward thing in the room. At 73, he’s neat and grey-haired, dressed in a dark suit and wearing unfashionable glasses. He looks exactly like a mild-mannered accountant – and for most of his career, that’s exactly what he’s been. For 30 years, he built an accountancy and financial advice company called Count Financial, which he sold to the Commonwealth Bank in 2011 for $373 million. Despite this deal making him one of Australia’s wealthiest men, he spent the following few years quietly tending his fortune (including two other listed companies), playing golf, and being a dutiful husband and grandfather. Then, starting in 2014, he watched his granddaughter miraculously improve from a devastating illness, donated almost $34 million to an Australian university, and became an international cannabis mogul. All of which is truly surprising – not least of all to Barry Lambert himself. Barry Lambert in a hemp plantation in Tasmania: “Hemp is as safe – and natural – as broccoli or orange juice,” he says. Cannabis is a flowering plant of the family Cannabaceae. It was among the earliest plants cultivated by humans: its medicinal history in India dates back 10,000 years, and the ancient Greek historian Herodotus described its recreational qualities in 440BC: on the release of its vapours, “delighted, [people] shout for joy”. This historic division between medicinal and recreational cannabis still exists today. Though usually described as a single species, over centuries Cannabis sativa has been selectively bred into hundreds of different varieties. Hemp, for instance – the raw product of Ecofibre’s business – is a cannabis variety grown for its fibres, used to make textiles, rope and paper. (The word “canvas” comes from the Greek kannabis.) Modern hemp is also grown for medicinal use: specifically, for the chemical cannabidiol, or CBD, whose claimed health benefits range from addressing seizures to treating irritable bowel syndrome. Another group of cannabis cultivars, collectively called marijuana, are bred specifically for human consumption. They also contain CBD, but their most important component is tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. Once heated, THC is the principal psychoactive component of cannabis: when you smoke a joint, THC is what gets you high. (Hemp also contains THC, but only in trace amounts. Ecofibre does not grow marijuana; as for getting high on hemp, as Barry Lambert puts it, “You might as well be smoking lawn clippings.”) THC also has medicinal qualities, but its fame lies not so much in curing the body as altering the mind. As Portuguese physician Garcia de Orta wrote in 1534, “[It lets people] rest from their work, be without care, and be able to sleep.” My first meeting with Barry Lambert is at the GPO building in Sydney’s CBD. In a cab en route, I get a text. To my surprise, he’s on the bus. As I walk down Martin Place I get another text. “I am here. Standing.” I walk faster. “Seated.” I run into the cafe and recognise him straight away, despite the multitude of middle-class white men drinking coffee as far as the eye can see. “Wow,” I say, “your bus service must be good.” “I always catch the bus,” he says calmly. This is true, say friends. “He thinks his gold Opal card is fantastic,” says Matthew Rowe, CEO of CountPlus (a company Lambert founded as a spin-off from Count in 2006, and which, like his third business, a self-managed superannuation fund software product called Class, has been a strong commercial success). “He loves bragging that it costs him $2 to get to the city.” Growing up on a dairy farm near Taree on NSW’s mid-north coast, Lambert learnt the lessons of economy early. He had a tough childhood – his father lost the farm to the bank during his childhood; his much-loved mother died when he was only 10. “She died on a hospital train to Newcastle,” explains Barry’s son Michael. “She was coughing up blood, and she said to him, ‘Barry, you’re the smartest one, you’re going to be a great success.’ He’s spent his whole life proving her right.” “I’m not sure about that,” says Lambert steadily. But whatever was driving him, he was the only one of five brothers to go to high school, and at 17 he got a job as a Commonwealth Bank teller. At 20 he married Joy, whom he’d met at 16, and they had two girls. They lost their second daughter Nadene when she was still a toddler, after an operation to treat her hydrocephalus. Michael was a baby when she died; Barry and Joy later adopted a third daughter. Despite his air of imperturbability, Nadene’s death has left its mark on Lambert. The thought of children suffering, he says, “makes me want to cry”. Lambert established Count Financial in 1980. Based on the idea that accountants could become effective financial advisers, it was incredibly successful, as its sale price proved. (In June, after the royal commission into the financial services industry, CommBank offloaded Count for the fire-sale price of $2.5 million. Ironically enough, its purchaser was CountPlus.) As part of CommBank, Count was involved in the fees-for-no-service scandal, but Lambert himself was never implicated in any wrongdoing. “He’s a statesman-like figure,” says Daniel Toohey, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. “Not in a pretentious way: he doesn’t care about getting his Order of Australia. He sort of sits there and he’s just a likeable bloke, very unassuming. But underneath he’s highly intelligent, with very sharp business instincts. If he believes in something, he goes for it.” After millennia of untroubled use, cannabis’s reputation changed early in the 20th century. Increasingly classed alongside drugs like opium and cocaine, in the late 1930s Australian tabloid Smith’s Weekly ran a startling campaign labelling it “an evil sex drug that causes its victims to behave like raving sex maniacs”. (Extensive research by Good Weekend failed to find a single instance of cannabis’s sex-maniac-inducing properties. Falling asleep on the job, yes. Priapic frenzy, no.) It was eventually outlawed for human use in Australia in 1938. Outlawing cannabis created three issues. First, it accelerated marijuana breeding to increase THC – some varieties today contain more than 25 per cent, compared to low single digits historically – because the black market required a product powerful enough to justify high risk and cost. Second, it muddied the waters between hemp and marijuana. Despite the fact that by law in Australia, hemp can contain only 0.5 per cent THC by dry weight, its consumption was outlawed alongside that of marijuana. And third, illegality made scientific research into its use in humans almost impossible. So for almost a century, those who’ve wanted to use cannabis medicinally have had to do so without any high-quality scientific evidence, and outside the law. None of this has stopped Barry Lambert. In Australia, Ecofibre owns Thompson’s, our largest producer of edible hemp seeds (legalised here in 2017). In America, Ecofibre owns textile, food and medicinal businesses. (Hemp, and all products coming from hemp, were federally legalised in America last year.) Ecofibre’s company Ananda Hemp supplies hemp oils, extracts and capsules to more than 3000 US pharmacies. Launched at $1 a share, Ecofibre has tripled in value, and in July its market capitalisation reached the $1 billion mark, with shares trading as high as $3.60. But in 2015, recalls Ecofibre CEO Eric Wang, the whole idea of a cannabis company seemed “immensely crazy”. He laughs. “Our first trip to the States, we go to Paris, Kentucky, and see literally one acre of straggly hemp and a few messy plants in a greenhouse. Cannabis was barely legal in the US, and I’m thinking, ‘There is no way this is going to work.’ And that night, Barry committed $4.5 million to the business. He really, really wanted to have a go.” Until 2014, Barry Lambert had never even seen cannabis, let alone grown or consumed it. “Dad lived in Coffs Harbour and Bellingen and never smoked a joint,” says Michael Lambert. “That’s a miracle.” Yet now, nursing his GPO coffee, it’s clear that Lambert is not only a cannabis businessman, but a true believer. “We’ve got to fully legalise hemp,” he says baldly. “It’s legal in the US, Canada, the UK, Germany – but not here. It’s bloody ridiculous.” His focus, however, is medicinal, not recreational. “I am not interested in marijuana legalisation,” he says. “I don’t really care what happens there. It’s hemp we need to sort out.” Katelyn Lambert, at centre, with (from left), sister Laura, father Michael and grandparents Joy and Barry. Credit:Louie Douvis My second meeting with Barry includes his wife Joy – a warm, talkative woman who often holds your arm as she speaks – at the Long Reef Golf Club cafe in Sydney’s northern beaches region. It’s a grey day, and the sea behind the Lamberts looks silver. Later, we walk to their house, a modernist oblong of angled light and large windows right on the seafront, with sand blowing over the lawn. It’s clearly an expensive spot, and a big house, but it’s not flashy – the rooms are filled with family photos, and Joy’s ironing board is set up firmly in the office. Joy, a retired textiles teacher, shows me a half-made dress – an explosion of net and satin – she’s making for the youngest Lambert granddaughter, Katelyn. It’s Katelyn Lambert, now nearly eight, who is the unlikely linchpin to this story. The youngest of Michael’s five children, she was born to him and his wife Nui in November 2011. She was the archetypal fat, happy, healthy baby. But at six months, she had her first terrible seizure, and just after she turned two, she was diagnosed with Dravet syndrome. This rare condition is the result of a spontaneous genetic mutation, and causes frequent “catastrophic” seizures that lead to permanent brain damage. Dravet children are subject to worsening sleep, behaviour and health problems. Up to 20 per cent die before adulthood, and there is no cure. “It’s just terrible,” says Lambert. “She was having multiple seizures every day. Some were quite small – you’d see her sort of nodding, her eyes twitching – and some were full-blown ones. They tried her on all the medicines; we went to all the experts, and nothing worked. And then Michael read on the internet about Charlotte Figi.” Figi is a Dravet Syndrome child based in Colorado, where the medical use of cannabis was legalised in 2000. After all conventional treatments failed, she was treated by her parents with high-CBD, low-THC cannabis in 2011. Almost immediately, her seizures dramatically reduced. To the Lamberts, dealing with the daily horror of Katelyn’s Dravet syndrome, Figi’s story sounded too good to be true. And so it proved: in NSW in 2014, cannabis treatments like Figi’s were illegal. For a year, Michael Lambert attempted to obtain it on compassionate grounds. “I rang up NSW Health and asked for an approval,” he tells me later. “I wrote to Border Force, I wrote to the government, I wrote to everyone. And everyone said no.” Katelyn, now nearly three, grew steadily worse. She was admitted to hospital more than 20 times. One of her doctors, Dr John Lawson, a paediatric neurologist specialising in childhood epilepsy at the Sydney Children’s Hospital at Randwick, recalls her “arriving regularly at emergency in status epilepticus – literally in the middle of a life-threatening seizure – that didn’t stop by itself, and required heavy medical intervention every time. Her outlook was terrible.” He also acknowledges that no conventional medicines had worked. “These families are understandably desperate,” he says. “And so sometimes they find, or try, things that doctors don’t.” Enter illegal cannabis. “We’d always been very law-abiding,” says Barry. “But you just think …” He stops. “We had already lost a child,” says Joy, taking over. “And I just thought, ‘Michael is not going through what we went through.’” She lifts both hands, eyes bright with tears. “I just kept thinking, ‘Joy, you’re allowed to be civilly disobedient for a good cause.’ Sometimes life takes you further than the law.” And so the Lamberts took the plunge. Joy gave Michael money for an illegal narcotic, whose importation was punishable by fine and imprisonment. And Michael took the money and illegally purchased a CBD hemp-extract paste called Endoca from Denmark. I just kept thinking, ‘You’re allowed to be civilly disobedient for a good cause.’ Sometimes life takes you further than the law. When I first met Michael Lambert – a stocky bald man with a beard and a checked shirt – at the Ecofibre launch, he spoke without drawing breath for five minutes about cannabis legalisation and, at even greater length and intensity, about his own sperm. When I reach him on the phone at his NSW Central Coast property a few weeks later, he’s much calmer. The sperm thing, it becomes clear, is about Katelyn. “I blame myself for her having Dravet,” he says, voice rising. “Nobody told me that alcohol mutates your sperm.” Then his tone softens. “Anyway, you’ve heard my rant about that.” The cause of the Dravet gene mutation, in fact, is almost always unknown, but Michael has no doubt cannabis rescued Katelyn from the condition. “I just couldn’t believe it,” he says. “I gave her a little bit the afternoon it arrived, and that night: three or four millimetres from the tube on a corn chip.” Katelyn usually suffered seizures each night. But that night, she slept soundly. “The next morning, I was sitting on the couch and she got out of bed and walked over to me. No shivering or lurching or losing her balance – she just walked. And I said, ‘Holy f… It works.’” For the four years since, Katelyn has been largely seizure-free. Michael still gives her cannabis paste (these days a specially concentrated Ecofibre product made by her grandfather) and a small amount of THCA – the unheated form of THC – each day. John Lawson, for one, had never seen a child improve as significantly as Katelyn Lambert did after beginning the CBD paste. “Never,” he laughs. “At the time, I was a complete sceptic. But I saw her a few months later, and there was clearly a very beneficial effect on the seizures. She still had an occasional bad one; she had more frequent smaller events, but she really stopped being hospitalised, stopped having the life-threatening events. That was the major change – and that’s very significant.” Could something else have caused the improvement? Her conventional medicine, perhaps? (She has remained on her prescription drugs.) “Well, it’s possible she was going to improve a bit on her own,” says Lawson. “But even taking that into account, I would say no. The cannabis really did have a major impact.” Dr John Lawson ran a cannabis trial last year.Credit:Marco Del Grande Internationally, cannabis legality has changed more in the past two years than the past century: we are, literally, on the crest of a cannabis wave. Thirty-three American states have enacted medicinal cannabis legislation; Canada made medicinal and recreational cannabis fully legal last year. Britain also legalised medicinal cannabis last year, following Germany in 2017. In Australia, details vary from state to state, but essentially, recreational cannabis is federally illegal and medicinal cannabis is legal. The average GP, however, must apply on a patient-by-patient basis to state and federal authorities via the Special Access Scheme run by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), and none of the 50-odd products available is eligible for government subsidy. “So people find a doctor who – hallelujah – is prepared to do the paperwork, but the product costs them $1000 a month,” says Professor Iain McGregor, a cannabis researcher at the University of Sydney. “That’s often totally out of reach – even more so if you can go to the pub and get a bag of weed, or grow your own in the backyard.” Obtaining cannabis products does appear, slowly, to be getting easier: Rhys Cohen, director of Cannabis Consulting Australia, points out that “the TGA has never outright rejected any application”, and approved providers (specialist doctors) can theoretically access products within days. But the number of actual applications remains extremely low. “There have been about 5000 applications made in the past two-and-a-half years,” explains McGregor. “Germany introduced medicinal cannabis at the same time as Australia, and in 2018 alone they had 180,000 prescriptions.” To Lambert, Australia’s lag is a basic “denial of human rights” – especially given that Katelyn’s treatment could be bought over the counter in the US. But Australian opponents argue legalisation could create a non-evidence-based market targeting the genuinely ill and vulnerable. In the US, thousands of companies market “wellness” cannabis products – everything from gummy bears to vaping pens – by implying benefits in conditions ranging from anxiety to cancer. The global legal cannabis market was worth in excess of $US24 billion ($35.3 billion) last year, and experts estimate the market will almost triple by 2024. All, historically, with zero high-quality scientific proof that in humans, cannabis actually works. In 2017, a 16-member expert panel of the American National Academy of Medicine produced a 468-page report, concluding that there was “insufficient evidence” of cannabis’s efficacy in treating Tourette’s, motor neurone disease, Huntington’s, Parkinson’s, pain, dementia, glaucoma, anxiety, depression or epilepsy. ""There is some good news. Modest beneficial effects from cannabanoids have been documented in trials in adults for chemotherapy-induced vomiting, chronic pain, and patient-reported multiple sclerosis-related spasticity symptoms. But by far the most unequivocal health impact was a negative one: that “cannabis use is likely to increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychoses.” The higher the use, the greater the risk. Hardly encouraging news. And yet, alongside such scientific uncertainty, there’s an immense bank of anecdotal knowledge about cannabis usage, much of it positive. But that, say scientists, is no justification for legalisation. “When it comes to asking doctors to prescribe it, they’re looking for that paper in The Lancet that has that properly controlled, double-blind trial,” concludes McGregor. “And up to now, that’s what cannabis hasn’t had.” Unsurprisingly, all the cannabis products Katelyn Lambert has ever taken are illegal in Australia. This has taken its toll on the Lambert family. In 2015, Michael Lambert turned up a couple of times at Gosford police station and taunted police with Katelyn’s CBD extract; on one occasion CCTV footage shows him bursting into tears. He also wrote to Pru Goward, then NSW minister responsible for medical research, pleading for help and attaching a tiny sample of cannabis to his letter. She reported him to police, who searched his property, confiscated Katelyn’s medicine, and arrested him. In 2016, he appeared in the Gosford court supported by Barry and Joy; no convictions were recorded and he was released on a good behaviour bond. Nonetheless, for Barry Lambert, all this was simply unacceptable. “Michael is still scared that Katelyn’s medicine will be confiscated, he’ll be arrested, and she’ll be considered ‘at risk’ and put in a home,” he says now. “That won’t happen, but if you’re a parent it’s a huge fear. Imagine your sick kid being taken away, and you losing your job or going to jail. No wonder kids never get treated.” And so Barry began his one-man crusade. Ecofibre is one arm of his battle. And indeed earlier this month, Ecofibre announced it would be applying for a licence to import its full-spectrum hemp CBD oil into Australia, and offer it for prescription via the TGA’s Special Access Scheme. How long this process will take, and how much the product will cost are both unknown, but the ultimate goal is to make Katelyn’s medicine available to other Australian children. The other aspect of Barry’s fight actually predates the business. It began just months after Katelyn started taking cannabis. In November 2014, Michael Lambert attended a cannabis symposium. There he met cannabis researcher Iain McGregor. A few weeks after their meeting, Michael called him. “He said his mum and dad were high-net-worth individuals, and would we like to meet them to talk about funding?” recalls McGregor. “Even then, as impoverished scientists, we thought we might get $100,000 – which would have been amazing. We had no idea who Barry Lambert was. Then we looked him up, and realised, ‘They’re for real, and this guy’s minted, and we need to take it very seriously.’ ” McGregor laughs at the memory. “And so then of course, we were terrified, because you don’t often get a chance to meet someone who can give you that sort of funding, and you’re very worried about the impression that you’ll make. But straightaway, meeting Barry and Joy, you realise just how normal they are. We went to their posh house in Collaroy, and Joy’s there making a sandwich and offering us a cup of tea.” In the end, Barry and Joy Lambert donated $33.7 million to found the Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics at the University of Sydney. It aims to develop cannabinoid products for mainstream medical use in conditions including paediatric epilepsy, cancer, chronic pain, obesity, neurological conditions and mental health disorders. It’s the first such organisation in Australia, and one of only a handful worldwide. But Barry Lambert’s relationship to it is not without tension. “When we first met Barry, he couldn’t even spell cannabis,” says McGregor. “It was just this strange, illegal thing transforming the health of his granddaughter. And he has a strong sense of morality around that, connected to her. He wants other kids like her to have the same benefits.” He laughs, slightly ruefully. “And that means that for him, the slow pace of scientific research is quite frustrating.” Barry Lambert doesn’t dispute this, especially when he compares his own granddaughter’s treatment – with a simple whole-plant extract from a hemp flowerhead – with the conventional pathway of bringing a drug to market. He argues that lengthy patent applications, clinical trials and regulatory clearances are unnecessary. “Hemp’s as natural – and safe – as broccoli or orange juice,” he says. The conventional process, he adds, also focuses on testing single molecules, one at a time, which ignores the value of the “entourage effect”, the combined value of all of cannabis’s 500-odd bioactive molecules. In Barry’s view: “Whatever your body doesn’t need, it just washes away.” Doctors and researchers disagree. “There’s always a problem in calling things ‘natural’,” says John Lawson. “It’s not natural to give a concentrated chemical to a child. And nor are all natural products safe. You can kill yourself with water and oxygen if you treat them incorrectly. So to say that CBD – or any product – is natural and therefore safe – it’s a nonsense, really. One great result is one great result. But that is not then generalisable to the average child with epilepsy. It’s a risk-benefit analysis. In Katelyn’s case, her outlook was terrible, so it was worth the risk. But in a broader sense, we have to do the science, because we have to know.” Barry Lambert, to give him his due, is willing to accept this view: he wouldn’t be funding the Lambert Initiative if he didn’t. Indeed, he’s actually increased his university philanthropy: he’s donated $US5 million to the Lambert Centre at the Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia – America’s largest medical university. But nor is he prepared to simply sit back and accept medicine’s sceptical, incremental advance. Which is why, as well as his identities as businessman and philanthropist, he’s taken up one more role: as a septuagenarian political agitator. Lambert and granddaughter Katelyn with former PM Tony Abbott. As a legislative vigilante, Lambert is, as usual, taking his own path. During a 2017 meeting with a senior bureaucrat (who has since left the office) at the NSW Health Minister’s department, he claims he was told there were two problems legalising hemp in Australia. First, the protection of the poppy industry in Tasmania; and second, the influence of Big Pharma within the political system. The reasoning runs like this: cannabis is thought by many to be a potential replacement for opiates in pain-relief medications. The raw material for opiates is the opium poppy. And Australia – Tasmania, in fact – produces approximately half the world’s legal opium poppy supply. Could Big Pharma be exerting pressure on the government via Tasmania’s poppy farmers? At a meeting in 2018, brokered by former prime minister Tony Abbott (a Lambert supporter) at Parliament House, Lambert met the head of the TGA, Dr John Skerritt, to discuss temporarily easing the restrictions around growing and using medicinal cannabis (hemp). According to Lambert, Skerritt told him: “‘I am not going to destroy the poppy industry in Tasmania for medicinal cannabis.’ He said it three times. Why?” According to the TGA, Skerritt’s comments were made “in relation to Australia’s obligations … to cultivate and manufacture medicinal cannabis in accordance with [internationally agreed principles]. [Non-compliance] could have a detrimental effect on Australia’s reputation as a reliable producer of narcotics drugs, including medicinal cannabis.” Given the easing of restrictions in so many countries, Lambert isn’t so sure about this. And elsewhere in the corridors of power, he claims that before the last election, Catherine King, then federal shadow minister for health, told Iain McGregor that Labor was reluctant to legalise hemp for fear media mogul Rupert Murdoch would label them “soft on marijuana”. “We had meetings with Catherine King,” confirms McGregor, “and I think [Labor’s] a little bit sensitive about being pilloried by certain newspapers if they’re seen to be ‘soft on cannabis’. I think they’re worried about being portrayed as Greenie pot-smokers.” Catherine King’s office did not respond to a request for comment by Good Weekend. It’s clear that the possibility of this kind of behind-the-scenes manoeuvring totally infuriates Lambert. “This is what we’re up against!” he exclaims. Perhaps that’s why he’s upped the ante: recently he brought back some Ecofibre CBD capsules from overseas and declared them at Australian Customs. “Under the law, that’s a criminal offence,” points out Michael Lambert. “The federal police were called to the airport, but they never charged him. I was charged for 2.5 grams, he has 500 cannabis tablets in his bag; he gets let off.” Michael’s theory about this? “He wants to be arrested! He could bring back a bag of buds and they wouldn’t arrest him! They knew he’d take it all the way to the High Court, and win!” Lambert, however, takes a different – and characteristically prosaic – view. “It was 15 capsules, not 500,” he says calmly. “Maybe 13. But it was close to the IPO, and I just thought, ‘It’d be embarrassing if the Ecofibre chairman got arrested for cannabis smuggling,’ so I declared them. The police did come, and they said, ‘We’ll have to take these,’ and they might have said ‘We’ll be in touch,’ – I don’t really remember. Anyhow, I went home, and nobody ever called.” For the first time in history, scientific evidence is starting to prove the medicinal value of cannabis. Despite Barry Lambert’s scepticism – and whatever business and political agendas may be in play – it may well be the long slog of conventional research that finally wins his battle for him. In the past two years, for the first time in history, scientific evidence is starting to prove the medicinal value of cannabis. Last year, John Lawson ran the NSW arm of a landmark international trial, sponsored by British company GW Pharmaceuticals, testing the cannabis molecule CBD as a treatment for Dravet syndrome. “It was a very standard, high-quality clinical trial,” explains Lawson. And along with four other epilepsy trials within the past two years, it definitively showed “that in these difficult epilepsies [such as Dravet], CBD is an anti-epilepsy drug. It’s generally well tolerated, and – importantly – it has a very low rate of serious side effects.” The importance of this trial for the future of medicinal cannabis can’t be overstated, says Lawson. And nor can Barry Lambert and his family’s contribution. “It’s the first real evidence to scientifically back up the experience of the Lamberts, and families like them,” he says. “The Lamberts are trailblazers in that way. Faced with a desperate situation, they took the risk. It’s very unusual to find laypeople in Australia driving medical research. But that is what’s happened here, and the truth is, without people like the Lamberts, we wouldn’t be here now.” I meet Katelyn Lambert at the Ecofibre launch. She’s the small child with the brown eyes and lovely open face, running, jumping, smiling for photos. Watching her, I remark that her family reputation as “the happiest Lambert” seems entirely deserved. Barry Lambert and Katelyn, who is known as ""the happiest Lambert"".Credit:Louie Douvis “She’s beautiful,” says Barry Lambert. “She’s counting to 10; using bigger words. She’s in a special class at school, but she actually goes across to the regular kindergarten class three days a week.” Because the Dravet gene mutation is permanent, she’ll have to keep taking medication for life. “She’ll always be the slowest kid in the class, but Michael thinks she might be able to go to a normal high school, if she makes huge progress,” Lambert says. How does that compare with the typical prediction for Dravet children? “Well, they’re usually dead by then,” he says evenly. Later at the launch, during the speeches, I see Barry Lambert across the room. He’s absorbed in his phone. Katelyn is hanging off his arm, being ignored. Bad granddad, I think, craning forward to see his screen. It’s playing Peppa Pig. He hands it down to Katelyn, who grasps it, fingers tight. Lambert returns his attention to the speaker. As a rule, it’s almost impossible to tell what Barry Lambert is thinking by looking at his face. But I’d be willing to bet, at this moment, that it’s some version of what every grown-up who loves a kid thinks in such a situation. ‘Problem solved.’ To read more from Good Weekend magazine, visit our page at The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and Brisbane Times.

This was published 7 years ago The first Australian-grown crop of medicinal  cannabis will be planted in Norfolk Island within months, with the crop destined for overseas markets. Australian company AusCann​ announced on Wednesday that it had signed a landmark agreement with the Norfolk Island government to grow the crop at a 'secure location'. Medicinal marijuana is illegal in Australia but Norfolk Island authorities have agreed to host a plantation for marijuana that will be sold overseas. The company said it picked Norfolk Island for its climate and security, and will begin planting in November this year. The first one-tonne harvest is expected in May 2016, and will be sold in Canada. AusCann managing director Elaine Darby said the company's two-hectare site and the climate on Norfolk Island would allow the company to grow strains that could not be grown in Canada. It will focus on growing a strain known as  which could essentially be ""grown-to-order"" with varying levels of many chemicals that make up cannabis. ""Essentially cannabis has a whole range of cannabinoids. There's about 80 different ones, and we will be able to vary the ratios of the different cannabinoids depending on the ailment, because if you have epilepsy, or MS or nausea from chemotherapy you will need different ratios,"" Ms Darby said. The company would also be able to produce some crops that were higher in THC, the chemical that is generally though responsible for the ""high"" from cannabis. ""THC also has quite a few beneficial properties, and some clinical trials they have done overseas show it has a definite role to play,"" she said. ""They call it the 'entourage effect', because it's about how all the components work together."" The company expects production to be scaled up to 10 tonnes by 2018, and has engaged a security firm to protect the outdoors site needed for the Sativa strain plants, which can grow as high as 5 metres. Norfolk Island Health Minister Robin Adams said in a statement that Norfolk Islanders were ""whole-heartedly behind this venture, which will provide much-needed employment and revenue for our community"".

Take Chris Nasr, founder of LeafCann, who represents the contemporary face of the medical cannabis industry. Chris Nasr is the changing face of medical cannabis. A 24-year-old electrician from a conservative Arabic family, Nasr is hard to dismiss as law-flouting drug user. Nasr's discovery of the herbal treatment came after his aunt suffered a stroke and was struggling with pain management. Medical cannabis trials are happening in Australia with positive results.Credit:Rohan Thomson ""Morphine was actually causing her more pain, so we went on a hunt for alternatives and cannabis seemed like the one that would have the best impact,"" he said. ""My brother and I were already running an electrical business together, which he is still doing. But my aunt's experience inspired us to make this passion into a business model. Sadly my aunt died before she could receive the treatment."" According to a University of Sydney report, treatment for multiple sclerosis is a $100 million industry waiting to be born, as it has been in the US where over 20 states have legalised the treatment. Nasr is trying to raise $6 million in seed funding for his company, which aims to distinguish itself with a ""whole leaf"" approach. Most existing players in the billion dollar global medical cannabis industry focus on extracting one compound known as CBD from the cannabis plant and creating a synthetic. ""It is believed that it may be a combination of many of these compounds together that may provide the greatest therapeutic effect, rather than such individual cannabinoids in isolation,"" says scientific advisor to LeafCann and University of Adelaide senior lecturer Scott Smid. That would include the smells and tastes of the cannabis plant to create oils, tinctures, topical treatments and sprays. Nasr says he has all the pieces in place. The government licensing paperwork is ready to go. A 70-page security plan is written. He even has a five-year plan that involves the UN declassifying cannabis that will open up export markets. But as high as the stakes are, entrepreneurs in this area face an uphill political battle. Australian Sex Party founder and Victorian MP Fiona Patten said both major parties and the Greens have been ""backpedalling"" on pushing forward with medical cannabis after it was legalised in Victoria in 2015.  ""If I was trying to get a business like that off the ground, I would be worried about timelines,"" Patten said. ""The legalisation of medical cannabis is inevitable, but we are going at a much slower rate than any other country."" The Victorian state government is currently cultivating cannabis for use on children with epilepsy but the law does not allow products to be used by adults. Without an adult market, Patten has concerns for the success of the industry. ""I'm saddened the drug is only allowed to go to a small cohort. How is it ever going to be economically viable? How can you ever get the price right?"" Nasr remains optimistic. His once reluctant family has agreed to let him use a property in regional Victoria for growing the plant, though he must keep its location a secret for security reasons. ""It's important to continue to advocate for education and scientific research as this will allow the political stigma around cannabis and psychoactive compounds found in cannabis to dissolve,"" he said.

""In this kind of emerging industry we basically are very innovative in our approach and today's announcement along with the other good news that comes with it, it is a validation for our business model."" Manufacturing medical products in Australia is no mean feat, with several licenses and approvals required from Australian agencies including the Office of Drug Control and the Therapeutic Goods Administration. There are currently 25 companies licensed to manufacture medical cannabis in Australia. Importing precursor products or exporting requires further approvals. There are 22 companies licensed to import medical cannabis to Australia. Up to November 30 2019, the TGA has approved more than 24,000 applications from patients for medicinal cannabis products. Current estimates put the demand for medical cannabis in Australia at about 250,000 patients and a market cap of about $1 billion by 2023. Mr Kanyon believes these estimates are modest as access becomes easier and acceptability grows. He said products like Auscann's will be aimed at a larger population. ""If you take the management of chronic pain in Australia alone the data shows there are more than 3 million patients,"" he said. ""There is quite a gap and definitely red tape and access is one of them. ""One of the main drivers for access is around medical acceptability ... in terms of patients and the stigma that is associated with medicinal cannabis.

The trial for children with severe epilepsy, who do not respond to traditional medical approaches, will be first to start, Ms Skinner said. It will be conducted by doctors at the Randwick and Westmead childrens hospitals, while the government will also set up a Medical Cannabis Expert Panel under the state's Chief Medical Officer, Kerry Chant. ""For a long time this issue has been discussed, but what we have today is NSW marching forward,"" Mr Baird said on Sunday, announcing that the government would spend $9 million on the three trials. To procure the cannabis for the trials, the government will first attempt to negotiate an import arrangement with the federal government. ""We're asking for that to be done as quickly as possible,"" Mr Baird said. ""If we need to deal with the supply ourselves, we are ready to go in relation to that, but we need to decide whether it can be imported. I expect that, in coming weeks, to be resolved.""

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 3 years ago The legalisation of recreational cannabis in the ACT would be a “micro-experiment” that could test the theories of both sides of politics and potentially pave the way for further decriminalisation, a leading researcher said. While the Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics at Sydney University does not have a position on recreational cannabis use, academic director Professor Iain McGregor said the new ACT law would provide researchers with plenty of material. “Are there going to be more arrests for driving under the influence, are the number of acute hospital admissions [going to rise] or is everything going to be exactly the same, and what are the implications?” he said. “It might help pave the way for broader decriminalisation.” His comments come after ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr said the federal government should focus on organised crime drug trade rather than the territory’s cannabis legalisation. The laws, passed on Wednesday and coming into effect on January 31, would make possessing 50 grams of cannabis or growing two plants legal. On Thursday Attorney-General Christian Porter said he would consider what action if any the Commonwealth government should take with the ACT laws. Mr Barr said it would be a “massive overreaction” for the federal government to intervene. “I presume none of them are arguing that recreational users should find themselves behind bars for two years which is what the Commonwealth Criminal Code allows for,” he told the Canberra Times. Jason Jordan, director of Medical Cannabis Research Australia, said the Commonwealth and territory split on the issue was going to “cause even more confusion” for people who self-medicate with cannabis. Mr Jordan, a patient advocate who takes medicinal cannabis to treat his multiple sclerosis, said one positive of the change was that it would help to reduce stigma with medical professionals and hopefully improve the rate of people accessing medical cannabis properly. “Normalising cannabis is an important part of what we do,” he said. “I can’t help but think that [legalising recreational use] helps with re-normalisation.” Chief executive of medical cannabis company Greenfield MC Nicholas Hanna said he also welcomed any law that reduces stigma surrounding cannabis. “We expect that many people who will benefit from this law will be persons who suffer from various medical conditions that are self medicating using cannabis,” he said. ""However it must be recognised that for any medicine to be most effective it needs to be produced at the highest standards, and cannabis is no exception.” Copyright © 2023",10,433

By Hamish Hastie Cannabis plants at Little Green Pharma's WA facility.Credit:Marta Pascual Juanola In just 16 months medical cannabis outfit Little Green Pharma managed to jump every regulatory hurdle and beat out a wave of bigger companies wanting a slice of the burgeoning medicinal cannabis industry. The WA-based company started on a park bench in early 2017, when managing director Fleta Solomon met with a retiring scientist to discuss how a technology he created, to improve the delivery of active ingredients to the body, could be used in the emerging medical cannabis sector. “We shared a vision to not only help thousands of people across the globe with WA-grown cannabinoid medicines, but in the way cannabinoid therapies could be delivered,” Ms Solomon said. After that conversation, Ms Solomon hit the pavement looking for cash; first securing backing from some friends, then eventually banks. The company has since secured more than 20 different licenses and permits from state and federal authorities to become the first in Australia to successfully cultivate and manufacture its own medicinal cannabis. Last week, in a first for the company, it invited this masthead to tour their top-secret grow facility in WA’s South West. What became immediately apparent is how serious the company took security of the facility and anonymity of its staff. Not wanting to jeopardise any of its hard-fought licenses, there were military-style precautions to be adhered to. We met Ms Solomon at a pre-arranged location, signed non-disclosure agreements, were handed blindfolds and told to turn our phones off. Little Green Pharma managing director Fleta Solomon.Credit:Marta Pascual Juanola We were then driven blindly on a winding route before arriving at the facility, which was unremarkable apart from an imposing fence and fake business name on the front. Even through the first few doors we couldn’t spot anything unusual. It wasn’t until after we donned our hair nets, lab coats and shoe covers that the uniqueness of the facility became apparent. It took a few seconds for our eyes to adjust, but when they did we found ourselves surrounded by a sea of bright green cannabis plants sprouting from huge pots, soaking up the light beaming from rows of halogen globes above. I was expecting to be overwhelmed by the musky smell that often washes over music festivals – instead, it resembled the grassy, fertiliser-mixed scent of a nursery. The walls were covered in foil insulation and the space was small but every inch of it was being used. The path between the plants was tight but big enough that the growers, dressed in green hospital-style outfits, were able to manoeuvre between them to inspect and cut leaves to improve airflow. The next room was awash with yellow light and even more cramped, with the plants further along their growing journey. The rooms are clinical and every aspect from temperature to air flow is meticulously controlled in order to stop crop destruction. Pipes run up and down the rows feeding the plants a precise fertiliser mixture and we were told they had regimented sleep times where the lights are switched off. On our visit the plants, which the company lovingly refers to as its 'babies', were only a few weeks from harvest. Once the plants reach maturity they will be transported to the company’s manufacturing facility, another top secret location in Perth, where different types of cannabinoids will be extracted, turned into varying strengths and mixes of medical-grade oil, packaged, and eventually sold to approved patients. Ms Solomon is confident in the potential of the industry, which Little Green Pharma has experienced. In just a year of manufacturing those 'babies' have made their way into medicine for more than 700 patients. The plants were nearing harvest.Credit:Marta Pascual Juanola According to patient figures from the Therapeutic Goods Administration, from January 2017 to June 2019 more than 9200 medical cannabis access approvals had been issued. More than 6500 of those were issued this year alone. A recent prediction from industry lobbyists Prohibition Partners was the Asian market could be worth $8.5 billion in just five years, buoyed by enthusiastic patients and businesses keen to meet demand. The ASX has about 30 listed companies, collectively worth about $1.6 billion. According to research firm Mordor Intelligence the global cannabis market, which includes medical and recreational, will jump from $21.6 billion in 2018 to $133 billion by 2024. Even traditionally conservative organisations such as the Australian Medical Association have backed further investigation into its medical properties. AMA president Tony Bartone said the association wanted to see greater investment in education and training for doctors on medical cannabis and supported moves to make access processes quicker. “Therapeutic cannabinoids that are deemed safe and effective should be made available to patients for whom existing medications are not as effective,” he said. Unlike lots of other cashed-up competitors, Little Green Pharma, which has remained a private company, went small first and partnered well. Ms Solomon claimed this was one of the reasons they were able to begin operating so quickly. “We were able to gain first mover advantage not only due to our ‘proof of concept’ business model, but because we partnered with an existing 'good manufacturing practice' manufacturer with an existing narcotic licence,” she said. “It was about proving we had all the relevant licences and processes from seed to sale. “This has been the hardest thing to navigate. It was literally an unpaved road that we had to that we had to create ourselves. “It was exciting, challenging, time consuming and quite costly. But now that we've done it, we have a fully operational integrated supply chain from importing seed genetics, to cultivating, manufacturing, packaging and distribution. Growers removing leaves to improve airflow between the plants.Credit:Marta Pascual Juanola “We have proven our entire supply chain and have revenue now from patient sales so we have significantly de-risked the business.” This revenue has given the company confidence to expand its operations to meet Australian demand but also venture into Europe, whose industry is also in its infancy and has equally strict cultivation and manufacturing standards. It also wants to ramp up R&D of different delivery methods and products but to do that it will need money and a public float of the company is being explored. “Being a private company has its advantages – we’ve been able to act swiftly and remain nimble,” Ms Solomon said. “We are actively exploring the European markets to distribute our medicines. Germany is a huge market as they've had 180,000 prescriptions for cannabinoid medicines, which have been reimbursed. “However, as we move to fund clinical research and expansion projects, we need to explore all avenues for raising capital, including a public listing.” Whatever path the company chooses Ms Solomon is confident they won’t have trouble raising cash. “It's not something that you really have to sell, everybody just gets it,” she said. “The social impact this business can have is incredible. The patient stories are very real.” Last week Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt announced changes to the sector that would simplify administration, remove red tape, simplify patient access and prioritise ‘major’ cannabis projects. The government has also agreed in principle to adopt all 26 recommendations of a recent review of the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967, which will have ramifications for the medical cannabis sector. The news was welcomed by the industry worried that Australia would miss its chance to supply the rest of the world with cannabis. ""The priority given to industry participants who are investing more heavily will encourage legitimate players to continue that investment, which will ultimately benefit patients,” Medical Cannabis Industry Association chair Peter Crock said. Canadian and American giants such as Canopy Growth Corporation have had more than a decade to grow their businesses and have the jump on exports. Ms Solomon warned there was only a small window of opportunity for Australia to make a global mark in the sector.  Credit:Marta Pascual Juanola Another WA company AusCann recently celebrated the first ever delivery of cannabis resin from a Canadian supplier MediPharm Labs. Ms Solomon said there was only a small window of opportunity for Australia to carve out its spot and regulators needed to remove barriers quickly. “Australia has an opportunity to supply international markets with premium-grade medicinal cannabis products,” she said. “We are relying on the government and regulators to support local expansion for the export market, because other jurisdictions will quickly catch up. “We are thankful to the government for the high quality products we produce but we do wish the long administrative waiting times could be improved so Australia as an industry could flourish.” A Department of Health spokesman confirmed the Office of Drug Control had received 250 applications for licences to cultivate, produce and manufacture medicinal cannabis received to date. But only 70 licences had been granted and 30 permits had been issued allowing work to begin. With hundreds of licences set to be granted over the next few years Ms Solomon predicted cannabis would eventually become a commodity. The company is looking to differentiate itself in other ways and the conversation Ms Solomon had with the retiring scientist in 2017 is driving that innovation quest. “In five years from now there is a good possibility that cannabis will just be a commodity, and the need to differentiate yourself becomes very real,” she said. “The Canadians are focusing largely on the recreational side since cannabis was legalised and their focus on the edible market is consuming them. “Our vision however, and how we're different is we are pharmaceutical driven and will focus on optimising how cannabinoid medicines are delivered into the human body. “In the next few years our expertise will focus on the manufacturing and pharmaceutical side. “We're going to be exploring optimal delivery systems from patches through to suppositories and sprays to help solve real patient issues. “One day, we may even be able to explore at a DNA level, and look at personalised medicine for cannabinoid therapies.” Copyright © 2023",12,1706

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 8 years ago Opposition leader Daniel Andrews' pledge to decriminalise cannabis for treatment of life-threatening illnesses comes as support for legalisation of ""medical marijuana"" gains momentum in Australia and overseas. In New South Wales, new legislation to legalise medical marijuana may pass as early as next month after both major parties indicated tentative support. Tamworth MP Kevin Anderson plans to introduce a private member's bill in support of medical marijuana possibly at the next state parliamentary sitting in September. NSW Premier Mike Baird, Deputy Premier Andrew Stoner and opposition leader John Robertson have all given their provisional support for the bill. At a federal level, a multi-party group of MPs – including northern Victorian Liberal MP Sharman Stone and Queensland MP Warren Entsch – are working on a bill to allow cannabis oil as a medical treatment for epilepsy sufferers, cancer patients and other life-threatening illnesses. Mr Entsch said he opposed recreational marijuana use, but supported the use of cannabis as a prescribed treatment. ""I'd hate to see people tagged as criminals because we don't have the flexibility to recognise the positive and scientifically proven benefits of this natural substance,"" he said. Norfolk Island would have been the first Australian territory to trial medical marijuana until a planned scheme was halted by the Commonwealth government. Earlier this month, Norfolk Island's health minister Robin Adams gave a green light to a Tasmanian company Tasman Health Cannabinoids (Tascann) to grow a trial cannabis crop for a local trial of medical marijuana. Last week, the Commonwealth stepped in to overturn the decision, with the island's administrator, former Liberal MP Gary Hardgrave revoking the local licence to grow the crop. Ms Adams said the trial would provide a ""much needed medical product for export"" while also being a ""great opportunity"" for Norfolk Island, which as an external territory is not part of Australia's welfare and tax system. Tascann may challenge the decision with the backing of the Norfolk Island community. Meanwhile, medical marijuana also has growing grassroots support. A series of rallies is being organised across the country on September 14 in support of making cannabis oil available for treatment of life-threatening and terminal illnesses. Medical marijuana activists the Australian HEMP (Help End Marijuana Prohibition) Party have also announced their plan to attempt to run in the Victorian state election on November 29. In December 2013, the Medical Journal of Australia published an article arguing for the re-introduction of medicinal cannabis, which was first outlawed in Australia about 50 years ago.  The president of the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation, Dr Alex Wodak, told Fairfax Media on Sunday that it would be better if both Labor and the Liberal parties agreed to legalise medicinal cannabis. ""The tendency in a sensitive area like this one is that one [party] will say no, and the other will say yes, and nothing may happen,"" he said. ""This issue should have never been politicised in the first place."" Dr Wodak said that when political parties joined forces in the 1980s to respond swiftly to the HIV virus, it was the Australian people who benefited. ""And that's why I'm hoping this issue will be taken like that. ""I would like to see the same officials who regulate penicillin or insulin also making the same decisions, and using the same set of rules to regulate medicinal marijuana,"" he said. Dr Wodak also cautioned against ""quoting studies about side-effects of recreational cannabis"" when protesting the legalisation of its medicinal use. ""The problem with that is ... that it's like trying to assess the safety of regulated alcohol with the safety of bootleg liquor,"" he said. Around the world, medicinal cannabis or its variants – for example, synthetic derivatives – have been legalised in several countries, including the Netherlands, Canada, Czech Republic, Israel, Sweden and 20 US states. In June, New York passed a bill legalising access to medical marijuana. However, laws vary in terms of what type of cannabis may be used, how it is obtained and the form it comes in. Medicinal marijuana has been shown to successfully reduce pain in chronic illnesses such as Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson's, and reduce the severity of chemotherapy-related symptoms such as vomiting and nausea.

We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 8 years ago Over the past few weeks, people have been offering to supply Mike Baird with marijuana. Understandable, perhaps, given that the NSW Premier did admit to ""experimenting"" in his youth during interviews to mark his first 100 days in office in July. But of course, it's Baird's enthusiasm for finding a way to use cannabis to offer relief to the terminally ill and others that has some prospective suppliers excited. On trial: Medical marijuanaCredit:Rob Homer Since announcing in September the formation of a working group to establish a clinical trial for medicinal cannabis in NSW, Baird has been receiving correspondence containing bouquets and brickbats for his trouble. Both are coming from enthusiastic supporters of cannabis as a medicinal alternative to pharmaceuticals for illnesses ranging from cancer to epilepsy. Baird is receiving correspondence from people offering to supply the cannabis for a trial, but also criticism of the decision not to act immediately and decriminalise the plant for medical purposes so that those suffering can potentially get some timely - and legal - relief. He has also been condemned by some who don't believe the drug should be legally available for any purpose. But reports from within the government suggest the overall response has been largely supportive - so far. Perhaps that's unsurprising, given the catalyst for the proposed trial: the plight of 24-year-old Daniel Haslam whose family has been accessing cannabis for relief of the nausea brought on by chemotherapy treatment for his bowel cancer. But step back for a moment and think about what is happening here. In NSW, where the politicisation of the debate over illicit drugs policy has a long and inglorious history, it is the Coalition state government that is pushing ahead on the issue. That's unexpected, to say the least. It's also why there appears to be some nervousness within the government about taking the national lead on such a potentially controversial issue.  While committed to establishing a trial, the government is also understood to be deeply concerned that doing so does not ""send the wrong message"". In other words, it's at pains to ensure its involvement doesn't give the impression that it is the first step to the decriminalisation of cannabis, full stop. Those involved are being confronted by some sensitive decisions. Should the trial include children? At this stage, the view is that it should not, given the capacity for disagreement about consent, for example, between parents over their child's involvement. The group is also wrestling with other questions, such as eligibility. Should it be confined to those with terminal illness or broadened to include those with other debilitating conditions that could benefit from the treatment? Significantly, the Haslam family has been kept closely involved in all of these discussions, including whether or not the trial will involve the currently illegal ""crude"" cannabis - the raw plant - rather than cannabis extract or oil. Baird has appointed upper house MP Catherine Cusack as the parliamentary secretary assisting him with the trial. Cusack, who like Baird has met the Haslams, says the government is particularly keen to get dispel any misunderstanding that the government will be running the trial. It will be conducted by the medical experts, who will choose its participants. She describes the government's approach as ""minimalist"" and ""cautious"". One that ""builds confidence in the scheme"". The working group has been asked by Baird to report back by the end of the year, at which point the government expects to be able to give a comprehensive outline of plans, including eligibility criteria and how it will be funded. The only major change expected before then is how police approach people found to be using cannabis for medicinal use in the interim period. As part of his announcement, Baird said the existing NSW police discretion to not charge terminally ill adults if they are caught using cannabis for pain relief would be formalised through new guidelines. As part of this change, a register of terminally ill patients and their carers is likely to be established. Perhaps the biggest unknown is how long the trial will take. Clinical trials, depending on their nature, can take several years to complete - the main aspect of Baird's plan that has been criticised by Labor and the Greens. But if the broader bipartisanship being shown on the issue holds - including backing from the Commonwealth and other states and territories - NSW could be on the cusp of leading an historic piece of law reform.

This was published 2 years ago Low dose cannabis oil can be bought over the counter at pharmacies from Monday for the first time, but don’t expect to find any for at least six months as none has been approved for sale yet. Manufacturers are working at a “lightning” rate to get products approved for sale in pharmacies, the former president of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, Kos Sclavos, said. A worker on the first farm licenced in NSW to produce medicinal cannabis prunes a plant. Credit:Janie Barrett FreshLeaf Analytics, specialists in the Australian medicinal cannabis industry, said the first company to get its product on chemists’ shelves will have a significant advantage in a market estimated to exceed $200 million a year. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) announced in December that it would “down-schedule” some low dose cannabidiol (CBD) preparations of up to 150 mg a day to allow pharmacists to dispense this medicine without a prescription. The Australian Medical Association opposed the proposal to sell cannabidiol over the counter. A spokesperson said it had not changed its position. Cannabidiol is an active ingredient in cannabis that doesn’t make a user high. A review by the World Health Organisation found it didn’t lead to drug abuse or dependence. Clinical research has shown it can help reduce anxiety, insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder and pain, said Dr Ben Jansen, the director and founder of Cannabis Doctors Australia. Dr Jansen said his practice specialising in medicinal cannabis was passionate about CBD because it was life-changing for about a quarter of patients. Far from being a “demon drug” as it was thought of in the past, he said, “we know it works, but we want to find out how well it works.” He said it would take “at least two million dollars and the appropriate data before (a product) can be registered for use for distribution by a pharmacist.” Cannabis oil can be legally sold over the counter from Monday. Credit:Sakchai Lalit Contrary to stereotypes, the vast number of CBD users were middle-aged women who took the medicine for pain relief, such as inflammatory arthritis, he said. FreshLeaf’s analysis of the TGA ruling said many products prescribed by medical practitioners - after gaining special approval because the drug is currently unapproved - will meet the criteria for sale over the counter. “History suggests that the first movers among product companies will be the winners, with the first movers in the medicinal cannabis industry in Australia still dominating the industry today,” said Cassandra Hunt, managing Director of  FreshLeaf. Mr Sclavos, a pharmacist who has specialised in medicinal cannabis, said the decision to allow pharmacies to dispense cannabidiol without a prescription was a major move forward for a “whole cohort of patients”. The first company to start producing cannabis oil will have an advantage in the highly lucrative market. Credit:Janie Barrett He had seen first-hand the “incredible improvement in the quality of life” that medical cannabis could deliver to a range of patients including epileptics. Compared with other medicines, the response of each individual to CBD varies enormously among individuals, Mr Sclavos said. That meant that pharmacists will have a “bigger say” in adjusting the dose. The TGA decision only applies to products that are on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). To register a product, a company must demonstrate that the products are high quality, safe, and efficacious. This is a time-consuming process, said Freshleaf.

This was published 5 years ago Students of Australia's first medicinal cannabis course will learn everything there is to know about the plant, short of ingesting the thing. There won't be any visits to secret cultivation facilities, but architects of the new eight-week course at Deakin University will teach best-practice in growing, extracting and manufacturing medicinal cannabis in Australia. Rhys Cohen, program manager of new course on medicinal cannabis.Credit:Peter Rae Dr Henry Pinskier, chair of a new Australian business launching the program called Cann10 Australia, said there was still a ""distinct lack of awareness"" within Australia's health sector about the laws governing the use of medicinal cannabis (it varies widely between states), methods of manufacturing it, and how it can be prescribed. This is despite reports of a rising number of patients asking for medicinal cannabis prescriptions to treat pain, he said. ""There is an overall lack of knowledge, training and education in this space, while there is increasing community interest, government activity and slowly increasing amounts of research across the sector,"" he said. The course will examine the ""whole continuum of medicinal cannabis,"" he said, from the science behind the product, the outcomes of clinical trials, and growing commercial opportunities in the global billion-dollar industry. It will be open to students and professionals in medicine, science, agriculture and commerce, who will study under industry figures including Peter Crock, the chief executive of Cann Group, Australia's first company to receive a licence to cultivate medicinal cannabis, and Phil Warner, director of Ecofibre, a leading industrial hemp company. Program director Rhys Cohen, said studying the genetic diversity of the plant and the conditions in which it grows effectively, will be examined in the course, which is yet to be accredited. ""It's not hard to grow cannabis, but it's hard to grow cannabis in a manner that achieves consistent results,"" he said. ""There is a huge body of knowledge around which light systems to use, which nutrients is best for different strains, and the different PH levels and humidity required for different outcomes … it's about finding ways to standardise that to ensure we're getting the same results when you grow a type of cannabis."" Medicinal cannabis was made legal in Victoria early last year, and is already being used in trials involving children with epilepsy. New federal government changes have loosened importation laws and boosted local supply, giving patients faster access to the product. Australian researchers are now running trials on the use of medicinal cannabis in palliative care and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. But Professor Milton Cohen, director of professional affairs for the Australian New Zealand College of Anaesthetist's (ANZCA) faculty of pain medicine recently told a meeting of pain specialists that evidence in support of medicinal cannabis is ""not good enough"". He warned that the very ""modest"" benefits medical cannabis have been ""oversold"" to the public. Head of Deakin University's School of Medicine, Professor Jon Watson, said more research was needed before integrating medicinal cannabis into undergraduate medicine programs. He wrote in an endorsement letter for the Can10 course that his faculty ""sees the need for appropriate and rigorous training standards for the use and application of medicinal cannabis as a priority concern for medical professionals."" Cann10 Australia is an offshoot of Can10 – an Israeli medical cannabis education company. The program will be run out of Deakin Co, the corporate training arm of Deakin University.

This was published 3 years ago Melbourne’s first stand-alone medical cannabis clinic and dispensary opens in St Kilda this Saturday – and it’s tipped to be the first of many. The Releaf Clinic will include a dispensary, doctors who specialise in prescribing medical cannabis, complementary medicine services, and a shop selling hemp-based products and organic honey. Releaf will open in St Kilda on Saturday.Credit:Justin McManus If all goes well, founder Gary Mackenzie hopes to open 500 clinics across the Asia Pacific in the next five years. “We’re not just about medicinal cannabis. We’re about wellness in general, health and wellbeing. People could come to us if they’ve got the flu,” he said. Mr Mackenzie is not alone in his ambitions. Several companies have opened cannabis clinics around Australia, with more in the pipeline. Releaf is just the latest venture for Mr Mackenzie – he’s also dabbled in blockchain, recycling, energy trading, bee breeding, and tsunami warning systems. He believes Australia’s medical cannabis industry is set for a boom similar to that in the US, where the market is worth billions of dollars. “The market is starting to mature. Public perception is starting to change because of the research and data that’s available now. The business model has already evolved in the US and Canada. We think the timing is right,” Mr Mackenzie says. Gary Mackenzie inside the Releaf Clinic.Credit:Justin McManus To capitalise on the US boom, Releaf has decided to brand its pharmacy a dispensary, which will open in April. But it won’t carry a variety of strains of cannabis behind the counter for people to choose from, as do US dispensaries. Cannabis remains illegal for recreational use. Instead the clinic’s doctors will assess whether a person’s ills could be helped by medical cannabis. If so, they must apply to the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the state health department for approval to prescribe medicinal cannabis – typically as a refined oil that may or may not have psychoactive properties. There are no restrictions on the conditions a doctor can prescribe for, but a clinical justification must be provided to the TGA. Many patients have previously reported long, frustrating delays to get access to medical cannabis, but that now appears to be improving – the TGA ticked off 25,182 applications last year. The agency says it generally takes two days to decide on an application. But the evidence for medicinal cannabis remains weak for the vast majority of conditions. This may be down to the difficulty of studying an illegal substance – or it may be cannabis is not an effective therapeutic. The Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists says there is insufficient scientific evidence to justify prescribing medicinal cannabis to people with chronic pain. College spokesman Associate Professor Michael Vagg fears clinics like Releaf could encourage people to seek prescriptions for conditions where there is no evidence. “If this was not cannabis, if it was any other type of pain medication, I think people would find this unacceptable,” he said. ""We don’t market any prescription pharmaceuticals direct to consumers in Australia for very good reasons.” A small handful of competing cannabis clinics like Cannadoc and MediCannabis have set up across Melbourne – but they typically sit inside doctor’s surgeries. Releaf, which located just down the road from St Kilda’s Hemp Kitchen, is targeting foot traffic. Mr Mackenzie said it was important the dispensary opened before the St Kilda Festival attracts tens of thousands of people to the area on Sunday. He said is concerned many people will come to the clinic hoping for a high. But his doctors will be trained to make sure cannabis is a last-line treatment. “There will be some patients who will get the wrong idea. But the only products people will be able to purchase, unless it’s on a prescription, will be hemp-seed based products,” he said. Chinese medicine specialist Dr Kylie O’Brien is in charge of training those doctors. She expects most people will ask for cannabis for chronic pain, where there is evidence it is more effective than a sugar pill, and can cut opiod prescriptions. “The public have done their own research. They are looking for answers. And they aren’t stupid,” she said. Copyright © 2023",15,721

Little Green Pharma managing director Fleta Solomon said more than 4500 people have now been prescribed her company's products and the new facility would help them meet increased demand.

According to the 2019 national drug strategy household survey, released last week, cannabis was the most commonly used illicit drug in 2019, with 11.6 per cent of Australians lighting up in the past 12 months. It also found attitudes were changing towards its use. And for the first time ever the level of support for the legalisation of cannabis in Australia surpassed opposition to it, at 41 per cent compared to 37 per cent. It was also the first time more Australians supported regular cannabis use than regular tobacco smoking; 19.6 per cent compared to 15.4 per cent. The survey found 6.8 per cent of people who used cannabis only used it for medical purposes, and of those people only 3.9 per cent obtained it by using a prescription. Copyright © 2023",10,376

This was published 11 months ago ASX-listed cannabis producer Cann Group has been given a boost after inking a deal with GlaxoSmithKline which could see the pharmaceuticals giant play a key role in the commercialisation of Cann’s over-the-counter CBD sleep product. Shares in Cann jumped 5.4 per cent on Wednesday to a high of 29.5 cents after the company told investors it had secured a deal with GSK Consumer Healthcare, which would give GSK data from Cann’s phase 3 trial of a cannabidiol (CBD) capsule designed to treat sleep disturbances. GSK will get exclusive rights to the data and will also have first rights to set up deals for marketing and distribution of the products in Australia and overseas. Medicinal cannabis is big business. Credit:Janie Barrett Cann chief executive Peter Crock said the agreement was 12 months in the making. “They [GSK] have a strong interest in the CBD space, and they are stepping in with caution,” Mr Crock said. In a statement, GSK said a partnership with Cann would present an opportunity for it to bring low-dose CBD products to Australian pharmacies. “The key terms of any definitive sales and marketing agreement are contingent on various factors including the results of Cann’s Phase 3 clinical trial, path to regulatory approval, large-scale manufacturing set up as well as GSK’s marketing evaluation,” the company said. Cann is in a race with several other medicinal cannabis companies to create the first “low dose” CBD product to be cleared by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for sale through Australian pharmacies without a prescription. The involvement of a company like GSK, which has a market capitalisation of $US113 billion, would be a significant win for Cann’s distribution efforts if the product is successful. According to a regulatory change in 2020, these products can be sold over-the-counter provided they contain only a low dose of up to 150 mg cannabidiol, an element of the cannabis plant. No products have yet been registered for sale, but the industry is hoping that clinical trials will conclude by the end of this year, paving the way for sale in 2023. Cann Group’s product will be in a capsule format and aimed at providing short-term treatment of sleep disturbances. The company’s phase 3 trial launched earlier this year, with more than 1000 applications online for 212 spots in the trial. “We got a tremendous response ... and we now have the first patients who have made their way through screening [ready to start the trial,” Mr Crock said. GSK Consumer Healthcare will have the exclusive rights to evaluate the product within the first 60 days after Cann files a final study report. The group will pay Cann £100,000 ($173,000) as a non-refundable payment and will also have first rights to negotiating exclusive licences for the pills in Australia and overseas. Several other companies are working to develop approved products and the TGA is currently accepting applications. They are looking to crack a significant global market, with research firm Statista estimating that sales of CBD products in the US alone will hit $US1.9 billion ($2.5 billion) this year.
