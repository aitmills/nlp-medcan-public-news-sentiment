Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has ruled out broad drug reform during this term of Parliament amid a new look upper house.    The results of the Legislative Council were confirmed on Wednesday, with Labor needing the support of six crossbenchers to pass legislation. Those numbers could come from the four Greens and two Legalise Cannabis Victoria members who will sit in the upper house. But Mr Andrews told reporters on Thursday cannabis reform was not something that was on the agenda of his government.   ""We've got no plans at this time to do that and that's been our consistent position. At the end of the day the government's been elected with a clear mandate to get on and deliver all the commitments we made,"" he said.  Stream more on politics with Flash. 25+ news channels in 1 place.

""But there will be some matters that have to be approved by the Parliament. We'll do what we've always done – negotiate in good faith with each member of the crossbench and hopefully be able to put together those 21 votes."" Legalise Cannabis party policy includes ""reform of drug driving laws where impairment, not presence, is tested"" and ""road safety laws to be amended to allow for a defence for medicinal users"". Mr Andrews said discussions took place on drug driving reforms during the last term of Parliament including with now ousted upper house member Fiona Patten but there were a ""number of complexities"" to changing testing.  ""But I think from a medicinal cannabis point of view, there are people who are not taking the medication that they need, because it's a binary test – you either test positive or negative, there's no .05 for this to use the most obvious example,"" the Premier said.  ""I'm not sure whether there's a fix to that. It certainly proved difficult to find one during the last Parliament, but I've always got an open mind to that. ""But I just want to stress this is particularly acute and particularly of importance to me for those who are lawfully using medicinal cannabis."" Mr Andrews said any change would not be aimed at ""opening the gates"" to broader reforms that go beyond medicinal users.   ""This is not about opening the gates or if you like reform for the purposes of another cohort and it was never put to me in those terms,"" he said.  ""It was always put to the government there's a bunch of people – for whatever condition they've got they need medicinal cannabis – but won't use it because of this driving issue. ""We have to do a bit more work on that and if there is a way through, then fine, but it is a bit challenging because of the absence of a test that can, to a level of certainty, determine impairment as opposed to positive, negative, yes or no.""

  A government report has found legalising cannabis could inject billions of dollars into the Australian economy. A cost breakdown revealed legalising cannabis for adults would generate $28 billion, according to a Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) report commissioned by the Australian Greens Party. Greens senator David Shoebridge said the money generated was enough to build 280,000 homes or raise Jobseeker by $80 a fortnight. Under the Party's ""green gold"" model, legalising cannabis would allow adults to grow up to six plants at home tax-free. As a result billions of dollars would be saved from police and criminal justice expenditure and redirected to schools, housing, hospitals and social support.

Offer ends 31 October, 2023  > “This is an opportunity for some serious investment in social justice,” Mr Shoebridge said in a statement on Monday. “The costing (also) assumes 10 per cent of the cannabis sold under the scheme would be sold to tourists, with the potential this could grow. This green gold could become the life blood of many regional areas currently struggling for viable local industries.” The regulation of the drug would fall under the oversight of the Cannabis Australia National Agency which would be established to manage the production and sale of recreational marijuana. It would act as the wholesaler between producer and retail outlets and set the price according to the drug's street value. While adults would be permitted to consume cannabis, it would be illegal to sell or distribute the drug to minors. The constitutional legal advice that dropped on Monday added fuel to the Greens' campaign for the first federal plan to legalise marijuana. The PBO policy costing report revealed roughly 12 per cent of adult Australians consumed recreational cannabis on a regular basis – a figure that would rise to almost 14 per cent in the first year of its legalisation. Mr Shoebridge said it was now time for the Parliament to catch up with community demand to legalise cannabis – a move that made “enormous social and economic sense”. To join the conversation, please

Several people have been hospitalised in Sydney in the past week after taking the substance.  NSW Health reported the synthetic drug had prompted rapid and severe adverse effects in people who had taken it. NSW Poisons Information Centre Medical Director Dr Darren Roberts warned NBOMes have greater toxicity than other hallucinogenic drugs and can cause a more extreme reaction. NSW Health is warning of the potential dangers of synthetic hallucinogenic recreational drug 25C-NBOMe after several people were transported to hospital in Sydney last week. Read the full media release: https://t.co/1uWmw9MDyH pic.twitter.com/1DP0IVE5rI NBOMes – also known as New Psychoactive Substances – are designed to mimic or produce similar effects to illicit drugs such as mescaline and alter a person’s perception of the world, according to the Alcohol and Drug Foundation. Dr Roberts said using NBOMes with other stimulants “increases the risk of harm”. “The hallucinations and stimulant effects of 25C-NBOMe can make people lose a sense of reality, making them prone to violence, accidents and injury,” he said. “These drugs are so potent so even a small amount is associated with the risk of overdose and there have been multiple reports of deaths from overdose and accidents in Australia over the past decade.” The powder flagged by NSW Health also contained a stimulant drug which produces effects similar to MDMA, called 4-fluroamphetamine. The overnight alert comes just a week after health authorities warned of the dangers of opioids present in cocaine, which NSW Health claimed was in circulation around Sydney.  Two people in the past two months have died from the fatal combination of cocaine laced with heroine, while another 11 were admitted to hospital.  Dr Roberts warned an opioid overdose could quickly occur after “snorting a single line” of the laced cocaine. “We’ve seen an increase in intensive care admissions and deaths associated with people using what they thought was cocaine, but in fact also contained opioids including heroin,” he said.  “One of the dangers of illicit drug supply is the concentration and type of substance you are getting is unknown and can be inconsistent.""  @NSWHealth is reporting increases in severe overdoses from cocaine found to contain opioids (including heroin) currently in circulation around Sydney.More information available here: https://t.co/67llRLggSK@eci_nswaci https://t.co/eoNukgQQ8V If you or your friends have taken MDMA or a hallucinogenic drug and are experiencing unexpected symptoms, call Triple Zero (‘000’) immediately or seek urgent medical attention.

The attack comes after an 85-year-old Florida woman was killed last month when an alligator attacked her as she was walking her dog. Local media reported that the woman was walking the pet by a pond at a retirement community in St. Lucie when a 10-foot alligator jumped out and grabbed her.

During the raids on Tuesday Raptor Squad officers searched a home at Fairfield West and found a large hydraulic press, electronic devices and more than 11kg of MDMA. Two men aged 22 and two men aged 21 were arrested and taken to Liverpool Police Station. Police later searched another home in Fairfield West where they found a further 12kg of MDMA, 2.5kg of cocaine and around 40 grams of a crystal substance suspected to be methylamphetamine. The estimated street value of the seized drugs is believed to be more than $4 million. The four men arrested were refused bail and will appear at Fairfield Local Court on July 18. Officers attached to the Hunter Valley Proactive Crime Team searched a home at Weston near Cessnock where a 49-year-old man, who is a member of the Life and Death Outlaw Motorcycle Group, was taken to hospital following a medical episode. Police then located a “significant quantity” of cannabis and established a crime scene before executing a search warrant. They found two rifles and a .22 calibre pistol, 350 rounds of ammunition, five gel blasters, an electronic stun device, almost 150 grams of methylamphetamine, 2kg of cannabis and $8,300 cash, among other items. Once the man was discharged from hospital he was taken to Cessnock Police Station where he was charged with 33 offences and refused bail to appear at Cessnock Local Court on June 15. Earlier in the week police located a stolen blue Ford Focus in Summer Hill. The next day a 33-year-old man, who was in custody at Campsie Police Station for unrelated matters, was allegedly found to be in possession of the key to the stolen Ford. When police searched the car two revolvers were found inside a heat-sealed bag and the man was charged with five offences in relation to the stolen gun. He was refused bail and will appear at Burwood Local Court on July 20. Police arrested a 28-year-old man in Wagga Wagga on Wednesday and during a search at the property where he was living officers seized prohibited drugs, prescribed restricted substances, fireworks and an incorrectly stored shotgun and ammunition. The 28-year-old charged with four offences and is due to appear before Wagga Wagga Local Court on August 3. On Wednesday police also searched a home in Darlington Point and found 1.2kg of cannabis, more than $30,000 cash, ammunition, mobile phones, prohibited weapons and a safe. Police said inquiries are continuing with charges expected to be laid. The escalation in police busts comes after the establishment of Strike Force Hawk in October last year which was made to target and disrupt organised crime networks operating in Sydney. The strike force has been incredibly successful leading to the seizure of more than 80 firearms and 3,300 rounds of ammunition, $2.8 million in cash, and prohibited drugs with a combined estimated potential street value in excess of $9 million.

A rise in Omicron subvariant cases and waning vaccine immunity has prompted fresh concerns over a new wave of COVID-19 infections. Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly on Friday warned COVID reinfection rates were expected to increase in a matter of weeks as subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 gain traction on Australia’s east coast.   “We are seeing reinfection, we know that Omicron, having had a previous dose of one of the other variants of Covid-19, did escape that immune protection from both a previous dose and from only two doses of vaccine,” he told Sky News Australia’s Peter Stefanovic. “Sub-variants of Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 that’s now become the dominant strain in the UK for example, and it is growing particularly on the east coast of Australia.

Offer ends 31 October, 2022. “We know that is more transmissible and it does have a tendency to escape the immune system so we will see reinfections over the coming weeks and months unfortunately.” Prof Kelly said that while the subvariants were more transmissible, there was not an increase in the severity of COVID-19 infections.   “What we’re not seeing is a large increase in severe disease that’s really due to vaccine protection which can be boosted with a third and fourth dose,” he said. He added COVID-19 treatments and the availability of anti-virals also aided in reducing the number of serious cases. Chair of epidemiology at Deakin University, Prof Catherine Bennett, said cases were likely to surge as vaccine immunity wanes and urged the importance of booster shots. “If you’re now at the start of winter, as we are here in Australia, and you haven’t had a booster but you have it now, you halve your risk of having an infection over the next while,” she told Sky News. “You don’t want to go through winter having a COVID infection every couple of months. If you put some of those precautions in place you reduce your risk. “If you have your booster now then that can drop the rate further.” Sub-variants BA.4 or BA.5 are expected to surpass BA.2 as the dominant COVID strain in Australia. The strains were first detected in Australia in April, with infections also gaining ground in the US, UK and Europe in recent weeks. The latest respiratory surveillance report released by NSW Health on Thursday showed BA.4 or BA.5 cases accounted for 31 per cent of the state’s COVID infections, up from 23 per cent at the end of the previous week.

In an Australian first, the Australian Capital Territory parliament has passed a bill to legalise the personal use and cultivation of cannabis. ACT Labor said the purpose of the bill was to treat drug addiction like a health issue, not a criminal one. “Whilst I support the use of medicinal use of cannabis, drugs in general cause harm but I’m always open to look at these things,” he said on Thursday. “If legislation was put up I’m sure it would be put to a senate inquiry where we would get experts before senators to be able to make a proper judgement.” Image: News Corp Australia  Read More Our Apps",0,133

Sydney teenager Osama Suduh died overnight after contracting coronavirus and pneumococcal meningitis. He was put on life support and Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young confirmed on Monday morning he died from meningitis. Pneumococcal meningitis is a disease that causes inflammation of the layers surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The Kingsgrove North High School student died on Sunday night at Sydney Children's Hospital. Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce described Osama's death as an ""incredible tragedy"" on Sunrise. Local community members were hoping for the best on Sunday as they flooded Facebook page Request Dua to ask for prayers and well wishes for the youngster and his family and friends. ""Please I'm urging you all to make sincere Dua for our young brother Osama 15 years old who's currently on life support due to COVID,"" the post read. ""If no signs of improvement by tomorrow, the life support will be switched off. All the dua we can receive is really appreciated."" A Dua is Islamic for a prayer of invocation, supplication or request from God for help or assistance. Hundreds of comments flooded the social media post as friends, family and strangers hoped for Osama to pull through. NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant confirmed a teenager had been admitted to hospital due to pneumococcal meningitis and was later discovered as COVID positive. “This has been cleared by his family. I can confirm that there is someone admitted to hospital that is 15 and that the cause of their admission, whilst they are COVID positive, is related to another health condition,” she said. “The family has agreed that we can indicate that he has pneumococcal meningitis.” Osama was from Sydney's south-west - one of the state's worst affected areas - where there were 204 locally acquired cases over the weekend. NSW recorded 415 local infections on Sunday, the second highest since the pandemic begun, and an additional four deaths. Our Apps",11,339

NSW Greens Senator Mehreen Faruqi has criticised the “militarisation of public health” in Australia after the Australian Defence Force (ADF) was deployed in Sydney to assist with the COVID suppression effort. NSW Police will continue to lead the compliance and enforcement operation while Defence Force troops will assist with meal deliveries, contact tracing and setting up vaccination centres. But upon the news that NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller requested military assistance, Ms Faruqi took to Twitter to compare it with her own experiences from her childhood in Pakistan. “News that there will be soldiers on the ground in Western Sydney, going door to door, has stirred up all my terrifying memories of growing up mostly under a militarised political regime in Pakistan,” Ms Faruqi, who was born in Pakistan before moving to Australia in 1992, said on Friday. News that there will be soldiers on the ground in Western Sydney, going door to door, has stirred up all my terrifying memories of growing up mostly under a militarised political regime in Pakistan. “There were check points, armed soldiers on the roads, neighbourhood patrols and people under house arrest. Anyone could be stopped at any time, targeted and imprisoned. People were surveilled and nationalism entrenched. “The militarisation of public health in Australia, in communities that are already going through these difficult lockdowns and the anxiety and stress of COVID-19 is just plain bastardry.” Ms Faruqi slammed the decision to bring in the military to Sydney’s COVID-19 hotspots as a “catastrophically bad idea” and criticised the Liberal NSW and Federal governments. “The Liberals are pushing fear and threats where they need to offer real support for people to stay home and get through this,” she said. Putting the military into any community, let alone some of the most over-policed communities in the country, is a catastrophically bad idea.The Liberals are pushing fear and threats where they need to offer real support for people to stay home and get through this. Skynews.com.au contacted Police Minister David Elliott and NSW Police for comment on Ms Faruqi’s statements but has not received a reply. Mr Elliott did address similar claims during his press conference with Mr Fuller on Monday to announce the troops had been deployed. He said COVID-19 compliance was still being directed by the “civilian police-led operation” set out by the “democratically elected government”, as Defence Force personnel are not permitted to conduct law enforcement. “There is no need for anybody to carry on as if this is some sort of move away from the government's response to COVID-19,” he said. “The ADF will work in supportive roles to ensure that meals are delivered to ensure that the police are supported in areas where they can then redeploy their assets to assure compliance across the city are maintained and met.” Brigadier Mick Garraway, who will head the ADF during the deployment, assured the military will only perform roles which are “supporting in nature”. “I want to stress upfront again that we will be under the control of the NSW Police, we are not a law enforcement agency,” he said. Fellow Greens politician and member of the NSW Legislative Council David Shoebridge also echoed Ms Faruqi’s claims on Twitter, taking aim at the apparent lack of consultation with local communities. “So the NSW Police Commissioner called the army in to patrol multicultural communities without first speaking to those communities,” Mr Shoebridge said on Sunday. “He still hasn’t spoken with them. How can such a man be in charge of the pandemic response? It’s so wrong.” Community leaders have expressed concern over the military deployment throughout the heavily migrant areas, but Brigadier Garraway said he had consulted with community leaders since the beginning of the operation. “We are reaching out to cultural groups just to make sure that they understand exactly what we’re doing and, importantly, what we’re not doing,” he said. The state recorded 207 coronavirus cases on Monday, with 51 infectious in the community, as the ADF hit the streets to assist officers with compliance. Our Apps",11,700

""It's not about looking back and examining the rights and wrongs of the former government's approach to negotiating these contracts in the first place.

Mr Butler said there was no deadline for the review but emphasised a matter of urgency to ensure the government has the right information available “sooner rather than later”. ""It's obviously something we want conducted in weeks, not many months,"" he said. The three key elements of the inquiry will involve: The probe came as Mr Butler appealed for residents to receive a booster shot amid rising cases of highly transmissible subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 on Australia’s east coast. “Still, there are almost six million Australians who are eligible for a third dose who have not yet had it,” he said. “The health advice is very clear, you are not fully protected, particularly against the Omicron variants, unless you have three doses of the vaccine. “Two doses does not give you sufficient protection against these new variants.” More than 95 per cent of Australians aged over 16 years are double-vaccinated, however, only 70.5 per cent have received a third dose. About 2.3 million of the 6.5 million people eligible have received their fourth “winter” shot. To join the conversation, please

Australians aged between 20 and 29 are “peak spreaders” of coronavirus and are transmitting it to their children and elderly parents, according to a report that helped shape the government’s latest COVID plan. Professor Jodie McVernon made the revelation on Tuesday afternoon as Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the Doherty Institute report would be released. The Prime Minister said the report provided ""the tools"" to help the Federal cabinet redesign the national COVID plan and the vaccination targets announced on Friday. Professor McVernon, the Director of Doherty Epidemiology, revealed the “peak transmitters” for this virus are different to the flu. “We know this from looking around the world for 18 months,” she during Tuesday’s press conference. “Yes, children can get COVID and we are concerned about them becoming infectious but they're not as good as their parents are. “In this case it's really the 20-29 years that are peak spreaders. They will bring COVID to their children and to their parents.” She said they are proposing a “reorientation” of the strategy to ensure younger Australians get their vaccines sooner rather than later. “Immunising younger people, reducing transmission is critical to maximising the gains of a whole  population,” Professor McVernon said.   “This is a strategy that basically follows where we are right now but brings forward immunisation of the 30-39 group to the beginning of September and 16-29 to early in October.” Australia is currently in Phase A of the National Plan - Vaccinate, Prepare and Pilot. Phase B, the Vaccination Transition Phase, will be achieved when 70 per cent of the eligible Australian population is vaccinated. The phase seeks to “minimise serious illness, hospitalisations and fatalities as a result of COVID-19 with low-level restrictions”. Lockdowns are unlikely in Phase B “but possible and targeted”. Australia will then reach Phase C - the Vaccination Consolidation Phase - when vaccination rates hit 80 per cent. Measures in this phase would include ""maximising vaccination coverage, minimum ongoing baseline restrictions adjusted to minimise cases without lockdowns, and highly targeted lockdowns only"".

Greg Hunt has attacked tobacco companies that target Indigenous Australians to promote smoking “disgusting” and “inappropriate”. Mr Hunt said smoking rates among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were three times that of the national average during a press conference in Mount Martha in Victoria on Monday.  “This is a particular blight and a particular scourge on Indigenous Australians and to those tobacco companies that are targeting Indigenous Australians – stop,” he told reporters. “It’s disgusting. It’s deadly. And, frankly, it’s completely inappropriate,” he said.  The Heath Minister said around 19,000 Australians die each year from smoking related conditions, with lung cancer contributing to about half of those deaths. According to The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare’s (AIHW) 17th biennial report Australia’s Health 2000 released earlier this year, tobacco smoking is the leading cause of ill health and death in Australia for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. The Australian Burden of Disease study estimated that tobacco smoking caused a total of almost 20,500 deaths in 2018, or more than one in every eight deaths. The latest figures from the AIHW showed the percentage of non-Indigenous Australians who smoked was 14.4, while the number for Indigenous Australians was 41.4 per cent. The Morrison Government last week announced $188million in funding to extend for another four years the Tackling Indigenous Smoking program – a targeted initiative aimed at reducing smoking rates among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The funding is part of the government’s commitment to reduce smoking rates among Indigenous Australians to 27 per cent or less by 2030. Mr Hunt said the program had reduced the number of Indigenous Australians aged 15 years and over who were daily smokers from 50 per cent in 2004-05. “Smoking is a factor in 37 per cent of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander deaths,” Mr Hunt said. “Reducing smoking rates is a simple and effective way to save and protect lives.” To join the conversation, please

Of the 112 cases, 84 of those were from the south-west, 16 from south-east, seven from Western Sydney and five from Nepean Blue Mountains. Premier Gladys Berejiklian singled out the Fairfield Council area as the local government area of biggest concern. ""I want to stress again, as we did yesterday, if you put yourself at risk, you're putting your entire family, and that means extended family, as well as your closest friends and associates, at risk,"" Ms Berejiklian said. ""If you're a key worker or you work in multiple sites and you're from the Fairfield local government area, we would prefer you stayed at home unless you absolutely have to leave the house and unless you can assure that you have a negative COVID test before you proceed to your normal activities."" Ms Berejiklian said the key metric of getting out of the lockdown will be the number of cases in the community while infectious - telling the state they want to get as close to zero as possible before restrictions are lifted. NSW Chief Health Doctor Kerry Chant said she was seeing cases among adults in the 18-20 age group emerge in Georges River, Bayside and Sutherland local government areas.  ""It is crucial that young adults limit their social interactions at this time and also come forward for testing,"" Ms Chant said.

Professor Kristine McCartney, the Director of the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS), said it is possible Australians can be affected with both diseases - dubbed ""flurona"" - at the same time.

""Like anything when you have a double whammy, you want to take the most steps you can to protect your health."" Prof McCartney said people may become more susceptible if they have not been exposed to the virus and the best way to avoid a ""double whammy"" is to get protected with a flu and COVID-19 vaccine. ""We had virtually no influenza and very low levels of other common respiratory viruses in Australia in 2020 and 2021,"" she said.  ""Essentially we quarantined them out. ""Last year we saw flu vaccine rates go down and we didn't have influenza itself to boost people's immunity. ""We may see viruses that may be more serious than the last one or two because some people may not have had their immunity boosted."" NSW Health reported 1,024 new cases in the week ending April 30, compared with 478 cases the previous week - signifying the state's flu season has started earlier than average. Of the 19,902 tests conducted for influenza that week, the proportion increased to 5.5 per cent from 3.1 per cent in the previous week. NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said the opening of international borders and increased social mixing can put people at higher risk of contracting the virus than ever before. ""Alongside the increase in flu cases, we are seeing more people with flu presenting and being admitted to hospital, including among young children,"" she said. ""As we have been advising for some time now, with international borders open and increased social mixing, people are at higher risk of flu than during the past two years, when COVID-19 public health measures meant we saw very little flu in NSW. ""This can be very serious especially for young children who have had little to no exposure to flu over the last two years. We strongly encourage parents of children aged between six months and five years old to get them vaccinated without delay."" Everyone six months and older is recommended to get a flu jab. Vaccinations are available through GPs and are also available through pharmacies for everyone aged 10 years and over.  Those considered to be at higher risk of severe illness from flu are eligible for a free flu vaccine and include: People are also encouraged to continue to keep up to date with their COVID-19 vaccinations.   ""Everyone aged 16 and over should have their COVID-19 booster three months after their second dose,"" NSW Health said in a statement.  ""An additional COVID-19 booster dose (or ‘winter booster’) is also recommended for those at higher risk of serious illness. For those who have had COVID, they can have their next dose three months after infection."" It is safe to get both the COVID-19 vaccine and the flu vaccine at the same time.

Thatâ€™s why from tomorrow until the end of June, GPs and pharmacies will offer free flu shots for Queenslanders aged six months and older. Health Minister Yvette D’Arth said case numbers are rising quickly - with 4,282 cases recorded over the past week, up from 1,848. “We expect in the next two to three weeks that our cases will end up at least doubling,” she said on Monday. “So we could end up with hospitalisations well over 400 or 500 hospital admissions and that won’t be the peak.” Queenslanders aged six months and older will be able to present to their local GP or pharmacy to roll up their sleeves for the jab.  So far this year, 151 Queenslanders have been hospitalised with the flu while 10 of those were admitted into intensive care. ""The flu season this year is significantly bad and it's comparable to the season we had in 2017,"" Ms Palaszczuk said.

  The Australian agricultural industry has enjoyed a bumper year with a major uptick in crop yields. Despite high rainfall and flooding across the east of Australia some farmers reported their crop yields were at “once in a lifetime” levels. Across the entire agriculture industry in 2021-22 there was a 17 per cent increase in value to $70.9 billion, according to new statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Broadacre crops received high production levels as the industry bounced back from the recent droughts.  Love news? Stream 25+ news channels in 1 place. New to Flash? Try 1 month free. Offer ends 31 October, 2022 >  ABS program manager of agriculture statistics Amanda Clark said several crops such as wheat, barley and canola saw above average and in some cases record production. ""Total crop values in 2020-21 rose by 41 per cent compared with the previous year, while the value of total livestock disposals fell six per cent,” she said. “Many farmers reported crop yields being at 'once in a lifetime' levels, with records broken in many regions for key commodities. “Compared with the previous year, the value of wheat grew by 99 per cent to $9.9 billion in 2020-21, with production up 120 per cent.” Drought-breaking rainfalls and improved seasonal conditions saw the crop returns soar with canola the biggest improver throughout the year with the value rising 114 per cent to $2.9 billion. Barley also saw improvements with the value rising 24 per cent to $3.7 billion as production rose 45 per cent on the previous year. Due to the improved rainfall and better seasonal weather irrigated crops also recovered from recent lows. Cotton bounced back with 566,000 tonnes produced, up 451,300 tonnes from the year prior, taking the gross value to $1.5 billion in 2021-22 - an improvement of $1.2 billion. Livestock returns were mixed with the value of eggs rising 28 per cent to $1.1 billion but that result was offset by a four per cent fall in the value of wool down to $2.6 billion and a three per cent fall in the value of milk down to $4.7 billion. The ABS said the declines in livestock sales were “largely” due to farmers using the better seasonal conditions and improved pastures to rebuild their stock levels. “This approach saw the beef cattle herd increase four per cent to 22.1 million head in 2020-21 compared with the previous year,” the ABS said. Sheep saw a similar trend with the flock size rising seven per cent to 68.1 million head and the dairy herd rising one per cent to 2.4 million head. To join the conversation, please

Aussies are being encouraged to ask people if they ""really"" are okay, as industry leaders are working to remove the stigma around mental health, encouraging people to speak out, acknowledging ""it's okay to not be okay"". A global survey launched by The Adecco Group revealed more than half (53 per cent) of Australian office workers admit they've suffered from burnout in the last 12 months. The research, based on a survey of 14,800 office-based workers across 25 countries, found Aussie workers are the most burnt out in the world, ahead of Italy (49 per cent), China (41 per cent), and Canada (40 per cent).

""Australian office workers have risen to the challenge of remote working – many of us are now happier in our jobs and more productive,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, the numbers also show that overwork is increasingly common. Some are finding it more challenging to switch off at the end of the day or are feeling emotionally and motivationally cut off while at work."" According to the survey, almost half of Australian respondents (46 per cent) worked an average of more than 40 hours a week over the last 12 months. The research also shows more than 1 in 10 Australians (12 per cent) feel their workload has worsened in the last 12 months, 13 per cent of Australians feel their job motivation has become worse, while 16 per cent say their sense of team culture and morale has deteriorated.

The country has also seen a significant boost to its Pfizer vaccine supply this week, escalating from 300,000 doses made available every week to one million doses.  Mr Morrison thanked Australians for their commitment to the vaccination program.  ""It does mean that at these rates of vaccination we will get to where we want to get to. The supplies increasing, the points of presence increasing"". ""320 new GPs point of presence for Pfizer established this week, more pharmacies coming online with the AstraZeneca.""  The Prime Minsiter also addressed the economic impact of rolling lockdowns across the country prompted by the Delta strain, conceding it will be a ""heavy blow"".  ""But it's not a blow we can't recover from, and how do I know that? Because last year when we faced the same heavy blow we turned it around and got a million people back into work.  ""So we know how to see our economy recover. ""Once we come through these lockdowns, whether it's in NSW, South Australia, Victoria, those economies will return to growth. People will go back to work, people will go back and buy things in the shops. The sites will open again an the economy will come back to life very, very quickly.""  Mr Morrison, however, highlighted the Commonwealth did expect the lockdowns to impact the September quarter GDP as well as a ""near-term impact on employment"".  ""It is impossible to avoid it when you've got lockdowns running at the state we're seeing across three states right now.""  He said he had spoken to the Governor of the Reserve Bank - and the deputy governor - who shared the expectation the figures would be turned around in the December quarter ""should we continue to be on the path we're on in increasing our resilience.""  Mr Morrison detailed the federal government's contribution to Australians struggling under lockdown conditions, saying 70,000 claims are being made a day and $32 million in support was distributed in the past 24 hours alone.  In NSW, 452,395 grants of support have been delivered with $219 million ""already out the door"".  ""We put in place a system of payments that is designed to be swift ... it's now exactly the same in all states,"" the Prime Minister said.  ""We're doing this because we want people who are experiencing these lockdowns and suffering these economic losses to know that each week those payments are going to turn up in your bank account and you can count on it. ""There's plenty of other things I know you have to worry about, I don't want you to have to worry about that, so those payments will keep turning up every week the lockdowns continue to roll.""  Half of Australia's population is in lockdown as coronavirus 'spot fires' break out across the nation.  Residents in the Greater Sydney region, South Australia and Victoria are currently subject to strict stay-at-home orders as the states battle outbreaks.  In the past 24 hours: Our Apps",15,769

Gladys Berejiklian was asked whether she's giving people ""false hope"" after claiming a 50 per cent vaccination rate will prompt the government to ease COVID-19 restrictions. The premier was challenged by a reporter whether there will be an end to lockdown in sight as the state recorded 344 locally acquired cases on Wednesday. ""It is important to say to people that if we have higher rates of vaccination there's every chance you can do something more than what you can today,"" Ms Berejiklian responded. ""If we can incentivise people to say, if you are fully vaccinated you might be able to undertake an activity which you can't now, that is a positive. I think most people would appreciate that. ""September and October will be challenging months in terms of public policy, how we move forward, because we wouldn't have reached the 70 per cent but we will have increased vaccination rates."" The premier said earlier this month ""further freedoms"" would be triggered once the state's vaccination rate reaches six million doses by the end of August - 50 per cent of the adult population. ""It doesn't mean we will be as free as we would like at 80 per cent or 70 per cent but it means we can live life more freely and we should all aim towards that, Ms Berejiklian said at the time. But on Tuesday, Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant revealed she would prefer New South Wales to achieve a vaccine rate of 70 per cent before COVID-19 controls are eased. Dr Chant indicated she believed that vaccine rates needed to be much higher Ms Berejiklian's 50 per cent target. ""I can’t speak for the Premier, but certainly, I’m very committed to the issues around getting our vaccine coverage up, but very much recognise that we need that 70 per cent,” she told a NSW parliamentary COVID-19 enquiry on Tuesday. ""Clearly the premier had used a target, but the premier is also well versed with the Doherty report and its contents and the implications.""

Premier Gladys Berejiklian said community transmission numbers in her state “are disturbingly high” as she announced the fresh infections on Monday. ""We can't stress enough how hard all of us have to work to reduce these numbers, to reduce the growth of the spread and make sure we are all staying home unless we absolutely have to otherwise,"" she said.

These include: Ms Berejiklian also warned residents would be forced to endure coronavirus restrictions as long as Delta remains in the community. ""There is a difference between a lockdown and restrictions,"" she said. ""We will need to live with restrictions so long as Delta is around. So long as Delta has presence in the world, even if we had zero cases and we were at 80 per cent double dose, you would still have to respect rules that exist around vaccinations, around social distancing, around mask-wearing. ""What we can do at every point is also determined by the case numbers. Will life be different when you have 80 per cent dose of your community vaccinated? It will be different. But the extent to which it will be different depends on the case numbers. ""If you have 500 cases a day at 80 per cent, that is dangerous still to say let it rip.""

Mr Bates said the issue most likely occurred while the plane was in cruise - the phase of flight that falls between climb and descent for landing.  “In cruise there may have been a system fault or a mechanical failure within the engine,"" he said.  “You’ve got control systems that control the engine and then you’ve got the engine itself, so any of those can generate an anomaly. ""And if there is an anomaly then precaution is to reduce power and if required then shut the engine down, and then select an appropriate engine your plane can sustain on one engine then carry out very succinct procedures."" Aviation expert Keith Tonkin told SkyNews.com.au after observing vision of the plane's landing the aircraft appeared to have issues with its left engine.  “If you watch the right-hand engine, you can see the back part of the engine cowling move backwards so that tells me the right-hand engine was working when they landed,"" he said.  “The engine is working effectively because they were able to apply the thrust reverses successfully - which indicates to me that it was the left engine with the issue."" Mr Tonkin said the Boeing 737 was designed to operate on a single engine and pilot's are required to undergo training for an engine shutdown.  “The 737 has to be able to fly on one engine it’s part of the certification,"" he said.  “Where there is an engine shutdown we have procedures in place to continue flying with the operating engine.” He said without knowing the full details of the incident it was difficult to determine whether the response was appropriate. “It’s a bit unusual to make a make a mayday call it usually indicates you are in grave or imminent danger, or that you’re unable to control the aircraft or you’re about to crash,"" he said.  “If they did issue the mayday call they may have felt it was a grave situation, but they did issue a PAN which indicates they were able to get things under control.” Passengers on board the aircraft said they suspected there were issues with the engine, but said they weren't aware the pilot had issued a mayday until after they had landed.   One passenger disembarking the plane told Sky News Australia's Gabriella Power that the pilot informed the cabin of an engine problem when the plane was on the tarmac. “When we got on the ground the fire engines were there and the pilot said ‘oh we’ve got to park because we have an engine problem’ and then when it was inspected he said ‘oh no the engine has actually failed’,"" he said.  “When they said we could turn on our phones I turned on my phone and had 18 missed calls from my wife saying ‘have you landed?’, ‘have you landed?’” Leila Kasem said other passengers reported hearing a sound but she didn't notice anything unusual.  ""I noticed something and I heard something but not really recognisable I would say,"" she said.  “I don’t think the pilot wanted to scare people, but he handled the situation in a great way."" A Qantas spokesperson said the aircraft ""experienced an issue with one of its engines about an hour from its destination"". ""While a mayday was initially issued, this was downgraded to a PAN. The aircraft landed safely at around 3.30pm and is now being inspected by our engineers,"" the spokesperson said. ""The 145 passengers onboard disembarked the aircraft normally. ""While inflight engine shutdowns are rare, and would naturally be concerning for passengers, our pilots are trained to manage them safely and aircraft are designed to fly for an extended period on one engine."" Qantas reclaimed the top spot as the world's safest airline after its ranking fell to seventh place in 2022, according to AirlineRatings.com.  The airline previously held the title from 2014 to 2017, and 2019 to 2021.

She pleaded guilty to manufacturing and possessing a controlled drug for sale.  The judge noted that while the 47-year-old had no medical training, she acted out of compassion and often gave away her product to those in pain. Read More Our Apps",0,64

Both the major parties and the Australian Medical Association have opposed the idea. Greens Senator Nick McKim has told Sky News the policy is ‘widely praised by health and addition experts’, but, when asked, he was unable to name any health bodies that backed it.

In an Australian first, Canberrans over the age 18 will be allowed to possess 50 grams of cannabis and grow two plants after a private members bill passed the ACT legislature last week. The move has been criticised by federal government ministers and is opposed by the Australian Medical Association. Mr Gazard said left wing parliamentarians are using the ACT as their own left-wing ‘petri dish.’  Read More Our Apps",0,95

Tyrell died on May 24, 2009 after two separate blows to his abdomen that caused internal bleeding and the leaking of his stomach contents, known as peritonitis. His mother, Heidi Strbak, 34, pleaded guilty in the Brisbane Supreme Court to manslaughter in November, claiming she did not cause the fatal injuries but admitting she did not seek medical help for him. However, her partner Matthew Scown was also sentenced for manslaughter on similar grounds in October but Justice Peter Applegarth last week ruled it was Strbak that caused Tyrell’s death. Strbak rocked back and forth in the dock at Brisbane Supreme Court last week as Justice Applegarth ruled she wounded her son and then went in search of cannabis instead of help. He found Strbak was the perpetrator of Tyrell’s abuse and did not seek medical help to avoid a child protection investigation into his ‘constellation of injuries’. ‘She deserves to be sentenced to a very substantial term of imprisonment,’ Justice Applegarth found.
