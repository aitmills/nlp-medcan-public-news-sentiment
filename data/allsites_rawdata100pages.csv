0,‘I’m not impaired’: Victoria’s parliament to debate drug driving in age of medicinal cannabis,,"Alice Davy was legally able to drive on other painkillers but now risks losing her licence on the school run Before Alice Davy discovered medicinal cannabis, the mother-of-two struggled to get out of bed due to debilitating pain. Now, she risks losing her licence every time she drives her son to school. “It’s always in the back of my head that I could go to jail or lose my licence, but I’m not scared of it like I originally was,” Davy, 33, tells Guardian Australia. “Most of my 11-year-old son’s life I’ve been in bed sick. I wouldn’t go back to that for anything.” While Victoria in 2016 became the first state to approve the use of medicinal cannabis, it remains an offence for a person to drive with any trace of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component of cannabis, in their system. This is despite the fact THC can be present in a driver’s system for long periods of time, even after the initial effects have worn off. It is this issue that newly-elected Legalise Cannabis MPs are hoping to resolve this week via a bill set to be debated in Victoria’s parliament on Wednesday. For Davy, going without medicinal cannabis is not an option. She was first prescribed it about four years ago for pain caused by her severe endometriosis, which has required 12 surgeries in a decade. Since being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 18 months ago, Davy has also found cannabis has reduced its symptoms, which include tremors and foot drop. “Without it, I would constantly have a tremor and I wouldn’t get to get out of bed because I’d be in too much pain from my endo,” she says. “Before I was taking cannabis I was maxed out on every painkiller you could think of. I have no idea how I was able to function, to be honest, but it was totally legal to drive with all of that in my system.” Cannabis has two main chemical components: THC and cannabidiol, or CBD. The former is responsible for giving people the “high” feeling, while the latter has no intoxicating effects. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Both are used in different levels as treatments for various conditions, including neurological disorders such as epilepsy and multiple sclerosis and for cancer-related symptoms such as nausea and pain. In several studies, THC has been shown to stay in test subjects’ saliva for anywhere between a few hours and several days after use. Among frequent users, THC is also commonly found in blood and urine samples for weeks after the initial effects have worn off. Davy microdoses on CBD during the day and takes THC at night. “I follow the strict instructions of my doctor and I’m not impaired in the morning. If I was, I wouldn’t get in the car,” she says. Legalise Cannabis MP Rachel Payne says Davy is one of thousands of Victorians currently taking medical cannabis – as prescribed by their doctor – at risk of losing their license or being fined due to the state’s drug driving laws. She says many people have been prescribed cannabis by their doctor but are “too scared” to take it because they need to drive. “Whether that’s to work or to drop their kids at school, its impeding people from accessing a medicine that has much lower harm profile than other medications that are easily prescribed and aren’t tested in roadside testing,” Payne says. Under the Road Safety Amendment (Medicinal Cannabis) bill, medicinal cannabis would be treated like other prescription medications when it comes to driving. It amends the Road Safety Act (1986) to no longer make it an offence for a driver who is unimpaired to have detectable THC in their blood or oral fluid, provided they have a prescription and that they have taken their medication in accordance with that prescription. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads The exemption does not apply to the driver of a motor vehicle who is impaired or incapable of having proper motor vehicle control. “It should be up to police discretion – if they pull you over and they can see you’re impaired, you can be charged for it,” Payne says. “But common sense should prevail – if a police officer can see that there is no issue with your driving ability, you have your script, they should wave you through.” It is similar to laws in Tasmania which provide a medical defence for driving with the presence of THC in bodily fluids. Daniel Andrews last week flagged that reforming the law as a priority for the Victorian government. “There can be as many as 200,000 [Victorians] who are currently using medicinal cannabis with a script from a doctor and they cannot drive,” the premier said. “That’s an issue that’s bedevilled us. We need to find a way through that.” Andrews said he did not want people not to access medicinal cannabis because they were worried about breaking the law. “I don’t want them to feel they can’t access that care because we don’t have [updated] drug-driving laws and we don’t have a test that can test for impairment,” he said. “You’re either positive [to THC] or negative. It’s a binary thing when you may not be impaired at all. So we’re working through that.” In 2021, the medicinal cannabis and safe driving working group commissioned three universities to conduct additional research into the issue. Davy is involved in one of the studies at Swinburne University. “In the driving simulator I wasn’t impaired. I was told by the researchers I was fine,” she says. “It honestly blows my mind we are still having this discussion.”",14,957
1,"‘It’s mind-boggling’: the complex, and growing, use of medicinal cannabis in Australia",,"Tens of thousands of people are turning to the drug to treat a range of conditions – but the evidence is patchy and costs can be high When Helen was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in her early 40s, her doctor prescribed her a range of opioids. She tried morphine, meperidine and a few others, but none helped ease the constant pain her chronic condition caused. Long before medicinal cannabis was legal in Australia, while Helen was travelling across North America, a doctor at a dispensary suggested she try cannabidiol oil. “He gave me this bottle of tincture and taught me to use one or two drops under my tongue,” Helen says. “My pain decreased dramatically. I was stunned.” But once she returned from her trip, her only option was the black market. Helen is one of hundreds of thousands of Australians who have turned to medicinal cannabis to treat numerous conditions, which they feel have not been helped by traditional therapies. But as the industry grows after its legalisation in 2017, the evidence remains inconclusive and the costs, for many, prohibitive. Today in Australia, medicinal cannabis products are only available on prescription. Data from the Therapeutic Goods Administration reveals that more than 172,000 people have been approved access to medicinal cannabis through its special access scheme. Only two products have received approval from the TGA and are registered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. One is Epidyolex, prescribed for rare but severe, drug-resistant forms of epilepsy in children. The other one is Sativex, approved in 2012 to treat muscle spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis. Doctors can request access to 224 different unregistered medical cannabis products through the TGA scheme or as an authorised prescriber. These products can be capsules, oils, nasal and oral sprays containing either THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) or CBD (cannabidiol) or a combination of the two. Some of these are plant-derived. Others are synthetically produced. Alongside skyrocketing demand for medicinal cannabis, there has been growing research interest around its use, with many clinical trials trying to demonstrate its efficacy for a number of medical conditions. Yet, strong evidence is often lacking and many products remain unregistered, making prescribing with confidence difficult for many GPs. Assoc Prof Vicki Kotsirilos, a GP and Australia’s first authorised medicinal cannabis prescriber, says the process for prescribing medicinal cannabis is “much easier” than it was four years ago. The major challenge GPs face is to pick the right product among more than 200 unregistered ones, for which clinical evidence is unavailable. “Choosing the right product is a real challenge,” Kotsirilos says. Prof Iain McGregor heads the Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics, a Sydney University research centre founded by a donation from the former finance high-flyer and medicinal cannabis entrepreneur Barry Lambert. “It’s quite mind-boggling to try and match a patient’s condition to the right product and dosage because often that clinical trial evidence isn’t there,” McGregor says. Yet the number of medicinal cannabis users has escalated over the past five years. This year alone more than 86,000 applications have been lodged, with the number forecast to surpass 100,000 next year. Like Helen, the vast majority of patients resort to prescription medicinal cannabis to manage chronic pain. Yet last March the faculty of pain medicine at the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists released a statement recommending health practitioners not to prescribe the available medicinal cannabis products to treat chronic non-cancer pain unless they are part of a registered clinical trial. “There is not one clinical trial yet that shows that CBD does anything useful for chronic pain,” McGregor says. “The prescribing continues nonetheless, and that’s not evidence-based prescribing.” Common uses for medicinal cannabis include treating cancer pain, and sleep and mood disorders. Anxiety is now the second most common condition for which patients request medicinal cannabis. Larry, a 43-year-old carpenter living on the Gold Coast, has been using it to cope with anxiety and depression for the past 18 months. A surf lover, an artist and father of five, Larry has struggled with his mental health since he lost his father at a young age. “I used to use cannabis a lot in my late teens and 20s,” he says. “It just took that edge off of the anxiety and depression.” Back then, Larry bought on the black market. Now he attends a specialised clinic and uses low-dose CBD with 2% THC. “The best thing about [medicinal cannabis being] regulated is that it is grown in controlled environments – it’s not just somebody growing it in their backyard or you growing it. You know exactly what you are getting.” Larry says medicinal cannabis is one tool he uses to manage his anxiety, together with keeping active, eating well and having a healthy lifestyle. “[Medicinal cannabis] is not a silver bullet but it just gives you a bit of reprieve,” he says. Like THC, CBD binds to cannabinoid receptors in the brain, controlling the release of chemicals that regulate functions and processes including mood, emotions, sleep, appetite and pain. Low levels of serotonin in the brain can cause anxiety, depression and other mood disorders. Researchers hypothesis that high doses of CBD could help regulate serotonin levels in the brains in some people. “There is a whole host of receptors that we know CBD interacts with,” McGregor says. “But the whole picture is very complicated, and we still don’t have the full jigsaw puzzle assembled.” CBD’s ability to act on many different receptors does not translate to significant therapeutic benefits. “Because it opens so many doors, you would think it would have profound effects, but it’s quite the opposite,” McGregor says. While some people continue to report experiencing tremendous benefits from CBD oil, he says, clinical studies have found that low doses of CBD don’t show any difference compared with placebo. “Paradoxically, the vast majority of patients use CBD oil at doses we don’t have any evidence for yet,” he says. At the end of last year, the TGA approved CBD products with a maximum dose of 150 milligrams a day to be sold over the counter as schedule three medicines. But unlike prescription-only cannabis medicines that can be prescribed even though unregistered, over-the-counter CBD products must be listed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. To register their products, companies must prove they have clinical benefitsand, so far, no low-dose CBD product is on the register. “There are lots of companies claiming that they are pursuing over the counter registration,” ays Rhys Cohen, the editor at large for Cannabiz and a non-executive advisory member at the Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics. “There are a smaller number of companies that are actually attempting that work. Whether they will be successful or not is uncertain because no one has demonstrated before that CBD at those low doses is effective for treating a medical condition.” While clinical trials have proven the effectiveness of some high-dose cannabis-derived drugs such as Sativex and Epidyolex, the evidence remains anecdotal for low-dose CBD products. “CBD has very complex pharmacological action we still don’t fully understand,” McGregor says. Kotsirilos says that in her experience, not every patient experience the same benefits: “Everybody’s response is different. Some individuals are more sensitive than others.” Starting with low-dose CBD oil only is her preferred strategy for most patients, increasing slowly to higher doses if required and finally considering introducing THC. But in patients with severe pain or chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting, such as those in palliative care, she says, there is no point in giving CBD alone. “Unfortunately, not all GPs are familiar with CBD products and feel confident enough to prescribe them to patients,” she says. “This is a gap that we need to address through balanced education in Australia.” But while the evidence of its effectiveness remains inconclusive, for the many Australians who are looking to the drug for hope in relieving their pain and other conditions, the costs can be formidable. The access system disadvantages less wealthy Australians who are more likely to suffer from those conditions for which medicinal cannabis is most requested. More than half a million people still turn to the black market to self-medicate, and that comes with great risks. Generally, unregulated products sold on the black market are not pure compounds but contain an undefined amount of CBD and THC and a mix of other substances, with unknown effects on the body. And home growers often use a range of pesticides that might cause severe adverse effects. When Helen failed to find a GP willing to give her a prescription, she looked for a medical clinic specialising in medicinal cannabis. While these clinics allow patients access to CBD oil products, they are not affordable for most. “These clinics charge outrageous prices,” says Helen, who has paid up to $350 for a 15-minute telehealth consultation. That is on top of the cost of the products, which are on average $0.14 a milligram, with prescribed doses ranging from 50 to 200mg a day. The government does not subsidise medicinal cannabis products under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. For many patients like Helen, that equals spending hundreds of dollars every month. “I’m in my 70s now, and I still work to pay for my medicines,” she says. “In the future, I would like to see better education for people and doctors; I would like to see costs go down; I would like to see a fairer accessing process for all.”",12,1569
2,Victoria’s major parties back overhaul of drug-driving laws for medicinal cannabis users,,"The government and opposition are backing Legalise Cannabis effort to change ‘unfair’ road safety laws Victoria’s drug-driving laws are set to be overhauled for medicinal cannabis users, with both major parties backing a push by Legalise Cannabis over the “unfair” rules. Debate on the Road Safety Amendment (Medicinal Cannabis) bill, introduced by the newly elected Legalise Cannabis MPs, was adjourned on Wednesday after the government committed to addressing the issue within months. The bill seeks to change the state’s road safety laws to treat medicinal cannabis like other prescription medications for drivers. Currently, it is an offence for a person to drive with any trace of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component of cannabis, in their system, even if they have a prescription from their doctor. The Labor MP Harriet Shing, who is a member of the medicinal cannabis and safe driving working group established by the government, said finding a “distinction between presence [of THC] and impairment” was a “significant priority”. “This work has been going on for a number of years now. The working group has actually discussed at length the complexities of this matter and the options and opportunities that might be available,” she told the upper house on Wednesday. “We need … to find a way through all of this so that all drivers are able to be safe on our roads and so that we can provide those medical supports that Victorians need and indeed deserve.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The opposition leader in the upper house, Matt Bach, said the Coalition viewed the current system as “unfair” and “inconsistent” for 65,000 Victorians currently prescribed medicinal cannabis. “Motorists taking other prescribed drugs like antidepressants, perhaps opiates, even antihistamines, may be impaired for driving purposes, but these drugs are not tested by police,” he said. While Victoria in 2016 became the first state to approve the use of medicinal cannabis, it remains an offence for a person to drive with any trace of THC in their system. This is despite the fact THC can be present in a driver’s system for long periods of time, even after the initial effects have worn off. It’s an issue the government has been grappling with for several years, prompting the establishment of the medicinal cannabis and safe driving working group, which commissioned three universities to conduct additional research in 2021. This included a study at Swinburne University to measure the driving performance and cognitive function of Victorians prescribed medicinal cannabis. Sign up to Guardian Australia's Morning Mail Our Australian morning briefing email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matter after newsletter promotion Shing said she expected the Legalise Cannabis MPs David Ettershank and Rachel Payne to meet with the roads and road safety minister, Ben Carroll, to progress work on the matter within the next month. “There is a sense of purpose and there is a sense of urgency about how we progress this work and this is a conversation which I am optimistic will enable this work to continue,” she said. Payne said she was “heartened to see the whole chamber – for the first time – acknowledge that Victoria’s drug-driving laws unfairly discriminate against medicinal cannabis patients”. “Given the bipartisanship on display this morning, and good will from the government, we are hopeful a solution can be found fast, considering the negative impact the law currently has on Victorian patients every day,” she told Guardian Australia. Payne did not rule out bringing the party’s bill to a vote if progress stalls. “The government has given their commitment to make this a significant priority. We will take them at their word and won’t bring our bill to a vote while we work through this process,” she said. “We expect to see notable progress within months.”",12,646
3,Medicinal cannabis: Does it work and what's the evidence for different conditions?,Wed 20 Feb 2019 at 12:10am,"Health Medicinal cannabis: Does it work and what's the evidence for different conditions? Thousands of Australians are now using medicinal cannabis to treat conditions like chronic pain and anorexia. Yesterday, the ABC revealed more than 3,100 medicinal cannabis scripts had been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) since the Federal Government relaxed restrictions in March 2018. According to experts, these people were just the tip of the iceberg. It has been estimated as many as 100,000 Australians self-medicate with cannabis they've acquired illegally. Advocates of the drug say it offers a safe and effective solution to people with intractable medical conditions. But critics, and some of Australia's leading medical experts, argue there's limited quality evidence to support the use of medicinal cannabis in most conditions. So, what do we know about it? And why, in some cases, is it still so little? Research into the safety and efficacy of cannabis has traditionally been very difficult. This is partly because of the illegal nature of cannabis, and partly because of the complexity of the cannabis plant itself. Christian Read insists while medical medicinal cannabis can't cure him of the pain he experiences, it grants him some relief. Cannabis contains more than 400 bioactive molecules, about 100 of which are cannabinoids — a diverse group of natural chemicals that bind to the body's endocannabinoid receptors to produce various effects. The two main cannabinoids that have been found to have therapeutic benefits are delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is known for its psychoactive effects — it's what makes a person 'high', and is why people use marijuana recreationally. CBD, on the other hand, is not psychoactive, and is thought to moderate the 'high' caused by THC. The ratios of THC and CBD (and other cannabinoids) determine choice of product for treatment of disease. Different cannabis strains contain different ratios of THC to CBD, and it unclear whether they act individually or in conjunction with each other. Because of the inherent variability of the cannabis plant, as well as the many ways it can be administered, the types of products, doses and research methods used in clinical studies have varied significantly. This, according to the TGA, has made it difficult to ""come to firm conclusions"" about how best to use medicinal cannabis. It's also why, with the exception of one product (used for muscle spasticity in multiple sclerosis), medicinal cannabis products are not available as registered prescription medicines. Despite suggestions medicinal cannabis may help with everything from chronic pain to reducing anxiety, scientific literature to date has painted a mixed, and largely inconclusive picture. Amid growing public interest in the drug in recent years, the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre (NDARC) conducted a systematic review of medicinal cannabis in 2017, which formed the basis of current TGA guidelines. On the whole, the review found the evidence was ""limited"", and suggested cannabis only be used when registered medicines have been ""tried and proven unsuccessful"". Jennifer Martin, director of the Australian Centre for Cannabinoid Clinical and Research Excellence, said it was better for patients to use drugs that had been registered by the TGA first. ""That's because current therapies that we've got have been assessed for safety, quality, and consistency,"" Professor Martin said. The TGA review found the strongest evidence for medicinal cannabis was in children and young adults with drug-resistant epilepsy, for which CBD products have been shown to reduce the frequency of seizures by 50 per cent or more in up to half of paediatric patients. ""This is probably where our best evidence is to date,"" Professor Martin said. The review found there was ""low to moderate"" evidence for medicinal cannabis products helping with the pain symptoms of multiple sclerosis, although the evidence was inconsistent. For chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, the review found high-THC medicinal cannabis products were ""as effective"" as conventional drugs — but the review only compared marijuana with older, superseded drugs. ""A lot the studies were from the 1990s, before we had really good drugs for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting,"" Professor Martin said. ""Now we have really good drugs, there's not really a need for cannabis products in this space."" For chronic pain, there was some evidence medicinal cannabis could assist with neuropathic (nerve) pain — but for most patients the effect was modest. However, a large-scale 2017 review from the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in the US found ""substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults"". ""But when the Australian team updated the information, they found we would have to treat 24 patients with this particular cannabinoid for one of them to get a reduction in their pain symptoms,"" Professor Martin said. ""Certainly some people that have taken cannabinoids do say they have had a lot of benefit, but we have also seen older patients who have had side effects."" Professor Martin said although medicinal cannabis was likely to be less harmful than opioid medication, the solution to chronic pain wasn't as simple as moving someone off one pain medication and on to another. ""It's an important question that needs further research … but I think my colleagues in the pain medicine and addiction medicine community would tell you it's not that straightforward,"" she said. When it comes to palliative care, the NDARC review found there was little evidence that medicinal cannabis benefited advanced cancer patients with chronic pain. However, Michael Farrell, who is director of NDARC and helped author the 2017 review, said the main concerns about medicinal cannabis were centred around long-term usage — which are ""not an issue"" when it comes to end of life. ""I can't see why we should worry too much about complex evidence if it's for short-term management,"" Professor Farrell said. Iain McGregor from the Lambert Initiative For Cannabinoid Therapeutics at Sydney University said although much more research into medicinal cannabis was needed, it was important not to conflate ""poor evidence"" with an ""absence of evidence"". ""In many cases the TGA guidelines state that good quality evidence has not been done in a particular area,"" Professor McGregor said. ""That's a very different outcome to good quality studies have been done and cannabis was ineffective. ""Often it’s just the case that the studies haven’t yet been done."" Professor McGregor said he thought Australia was ""erring too far on the side of caution"" in its approach to medicinal cannabis. ""I think other similar OECD countries have decided to give cannabis the benefit of the doubt, particularly in patients who are desperate,"" he said. But Professor Martin said Australia was right to take a slow and steady approach to developing knowledge about the efficacy and safety of medicinal cannabis. ""Patients have a short-term solution — they can get access through the TGA system,"" she said. ""But long term, we still have to collect rigorous data and make sure our patients are safe before we roll out open access to a product that we don't really know how to use properly."" Professor Farrell agreed and said it was ""important people have realistic expectations of what medicinal cannabis might do, other than thinking it's some sort of magic bullet"".

4,Medicinal cannabis companies fined almost $1m by TGA over false treatment claims,,"Australia’s drugs regulator issues 73 infringement notices over claims prescriptions could treat conditions such as cancer and epilepsy Medicinal cannabis companies that falsely claimed their prescription products could treat serious conditions, such as cancer and epilepsy, have received a collective fine of almost $1m by Australia’s drugs regulator. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) issued 73 infringement notices totalling $972,360 between the medicinal cannabis companies MGC Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Cannatrek Ltd and Little Green Pharma Ltd. The infringements were for the alleged unlawful advertising of medicinal cannabis products on websites and social media platforms. In Australia, promoting prescription medicines to the general public is illegal in order to protect consumers against misleading or false claims and to better ensure medical advice only comes from health professionals who have seen the patient and know their history. The TGA alleges the companies unlawfully promoted prescription-only medicinal cannabis products, including references on their websites that the products can treat serious diseases or conditions including cancer and epilepsy. “Further, some advertising allegedly suggested or implied that particular medicinal cannabis products were recommended or approved by a government authority,” the TGA said in a statement. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The use in advertisements of claims about a serious disease or condition is also unlawful without express permission from the TGA because Australians facing a serious disease or condition are a particularly vulnerable consumer group.” The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners president, Adj Prof Karen Price, said medicinal cannabis is sometimes prescribed as a “last-resort medication for specific illness”. Depending on the medical condition, “the quality of evidence varies and in some cases is inconclusive or insufficient to suggest any benefit to patients”, she said.

5,Boom in unapproved medicinal cannabis products worries Australian experts,,"Some patients are taking cannabis for conditions where there is little evidence it is effective, GPs and researchers say Prescriptions for unapproved medicinal cannabis products in Australia have quadrupled since 2019, with half issued for adults aged 24 and under. Researchers and GPs’ representatives have questioned whether the boom has led to patients taking cannabis for conditions where there is little evidence it is effective, given large gaps in the data and the role of cannabis manufacturers in promoting their product to practitioners. Most prescriptions for medicinal cannabis in Australia are for unapproved products, which means they have not been authorised by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for legal supply. Practitioners must apply to the TGA through the Special Access Scheme for permission to prescribe the products, and show why approved products are not suitable. Since the start of 2021 the TGA has approved more than 200,000 medicinal cannabis prescriptions through the scheme for people who are not severely ill but who have exhausted evidence-based treatments for their condition. There were 122,486 such prescriptions in 2021 alone, compared with 57,714 in 2020 and 25,516 in 2019. Doctors treating terminally ill patients or those likely to die prematurely apply through a separate, less commonly used process. The president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Karen Price, said medicinal cannabis products should be seen as “last-resort medication for specific illness”. “Most of the research on medicinal cannabis products is on five clinical conditions: multiple sclerosis, palliative care, epilepsy, nausea and vomiting, and chronic non-cancer pain,” she said. “The quality of evidence varies and in some cases is inconclusive or insufficient to suggest any benefit to patients. However, if after conventional, evidence-based treatments have failed, and medicinal cannabis products are considered a viable treatment option, it’s reasonable for clinicians and patients to consider medicinal cannabis.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The most common reason for prescriptions was chronic pain (60% of approvals), but almost one in four were for anxiety. This is despite low-quality and patchy evidence that medicinal cannabis products are effective for anxiety. A survey from the University of Sydney’s Lambert Initiative, published on Thursday, found 37% of respondents obtained medicinal cannabis with a prescription, compared with only 2.5% in the previous survey, conducted two years earlier. The survey found the main reason for using prescribed medicinal cannabis was chronic pain, followed by mental health and sleep disorders. It found 95% of users reported improved health. The lead researcher, Prof Nicholas Lintzeris, said people using illicit cannabis were more likely to smoke it, whereas people using prescribed products were more likely to use oral products or vaporised cannabis, “highlighting a health benefit of using prescribed products”. A separate paper outlining the rise of medicinal cannabis prescriptions, led by Dr Christine Hallinan from the University of Melbourne’s department of general practice, found that of the 277,338 medicinal cannabis prescription approvals between January 2017 and August 2022, 50% were for patients aged between 18 and 24, and 31% were for those aged 45 to 64. Hallinan said evidence was lacking that medicinal cannabis was an effective treatment for many of the conditions claimed by its manufacturers, although that did not mean clinical trials might not eventually show the products worked. She said increased prescribing had not been accompanied by strong monitoring of efficacy, side-effects and which conditions specific age groups were using the products for. She said patients should be encouraged to use apps to track their outcomes, and this data could then be combined with deidentified patient data and prescribing data to better understand the use and impact of medicinal cannabis. “At the moment we can’t tell how many patients are actually filling their scripts,” she said. Sign up to Guardian Australia's Morning Mail Our Australian morning briefing email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matter after newsletter promotion “For every product on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and even many products on the [Special Access Scheme], you have a [deidentified] register of patients so you can see how many people are actually taking the drug, and you can also link this to other drugs they’re on, hospital admissions and deaths data. We can’t do this for medicinal cannabis because there is no patient database.” Hallinan said the launch of cannabis clinics was one reason for the sharp rise in prescriptions. Some clinics have a strong online presence, and offer same-day appointments to a prescribing GP. Some claim medicinal cannabis can be useful in treating a wide range of conditions, including migraine, insomnia, stress and pelvic pain, without always highlighting adverse events or the limited evidence. The RACGP said it was very concerned about the emergence of online prescription services for medicinal cannabis. “There are numerous risks to these types of services offering prescriptions via telehealth or online,” Price said. “A key concern is that these services are fundamentally responding to a business opportunity rather than delivering healthcare. They won’t have the patient’s medical history and these services can lead to fragmented and poor-quality care.” Many of the major dispensaries operating in Australia are owned by medicinal cannabis manufacturers and suppliers. On Wednesday, the TGA issued 73 infringement notices totalling $972,360 to three medicinal cannabis companies for the alleged unlawful advertising of medicinal cannabis products on their websites and social media platforms. The companies allegedly promoted the use of prescription-only, unapproved medicinal cannabis products, and published references to the treatment of serious diseases such as cancer and epilepsy. Dr Mark Morgan, a professor of general practice and chair of the RACGP’s quality care expert committee, said the influence of the industry may have led to levels of prescribing not justified by the evidence of efficacy. “The industry has been guiding a lot of the education, facilitating a lot of the prescribing, and leading the marketing of these products,” Morgan said. “There’s been marketing to clinicians and pharmacies about medicinal cannabis which is dressed up as ‘education’. But it is not independent, and therefore we have to question whether or not some of the prescribing is following the evidence, or going beyond it.”",9,1028
6,"Medicinal cannabis is legal in Australia, but people like Grace are still turning to the black market",Wed 1 Jul 2020 at 9:30pm," Medicinal cannabis is legal in Australia, but people like Grace are still turning to the black market After Grace* was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year, she turned to medicinal cannabis. But accessing it through legal medical channels was a challenge: she faced long waiting times and substantial paperwork. ""I was offered through an illegal source where I could get it very quickly, and because my tumours were aggressive and time is of the essence, I decided to opt for the non-medical option,"" she tells ABC RN's Life Matters. Grace started to get cannabidiol (CBD) oil sent to her in the post, in an olive oil bottle. But concerns about the illegalities of the drug started to weigh on her conscience, and she worried about the chemical composition of the CBD oil she was taking. ""If you're obtaining it through a medical source and it's been approved, there's stringent procedures and processes in order to create that oil. Whereas if I'm getting it off an illegal source, it's hard to actually know exactly what I'm taking,"" she says. Does medicinal cannabis work? Take a look at the evidence for different conditions. She decided to ""have another look at obtaining it through the medical channels"" — but in the end, she opted to ""stick with the illegal source"". ""It just seemed like the most easiest, cost effective option for me,"" Grace says. Nicholas Lintzeris, an addiction medicine specialist at the University of Sydney, says Grace's experience is not uncommon. ""The legal system we've had available now has been in place for about four years, and in the early days for the first couple of years we had a very clunky system,"" he says. Professor Lintzeris was the lead researcher in a study on how Australians use medicinal cannabis — for everything from chronic pain to mental health conditions. The online survey of more than 1,300 people found that while cannabis is used widely for medicinal reasons, the vast majority of respondents don't get it from their doctor.  ""It was very difficult for patients to be able to find doctors who were knowledgeable and interested, the products were quite expensive, the legal hoops were quite pronounced. There were lots of hurdles, paperwork and so forth,"" Professor Lintzeris says. ""Most of our respondents were working. They were people who were holding down jobs, mums and dads with kids. So engaging with illicit activities such as that was a concern."" Life Matters listeners shared stories of similar hurdles: ""I have a well noted and long-term chronic pain condition, which has proven relief with CBD. Yet I have been constantly stymied in my attempts to get it prescribed. Thus I am forced to go through the black market with all its problems."" ""My husband was prescribed medicinal cannabis for his cancer pain — incredibly expensive — around $350 for a very small bottle that may last a couple of months only. It was very helpful but we just couldn't afford to keep buying it."" ""I'd rather be using medical cannabis than opium products any day. But it is so expensive to access legally and yet opium products are subsidised by the government. The addiction story for opioids is horrendous. Cognitive dissonance [is] the right word for our culture."" Access to legal medicinal cannabis is granted under the Special Access Scheme. It's managed by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, and you need a restricted prescription for it. The application needs to be done by a doctor on your behalf, and it must show you have a medical reason for accessing cannabis. Between the start of 2020 and May 31, more than 18,000 applications for medical cannabis were approved by the TGA. Professor Lintzeris says the system has adapted and improved since medical cannabis was legalised at the federal level in 2016. Initially people would face wait times of up to two months for approval, he says, but now that's more like two to four weeks — and that's not the only change. ""I think we're seeing some changes in the development of the marketplace, as more doctors take up this option and get better educated around what medical cannabis is, as the price of products is reducing and as more products come onto the market, and there's more and more consumers who are getting experienced with legal supplies,"" Professor Lintzeris says. But he argues that some areas of the law are still lagging behind. Driving with THC in your system is a criminal offence, even if you've been prescribed medical cannabis. After a tenure affected by trauma and threats, this magistrate stepped down because he could no longer apply NSW's drug driving laws. The standard advice for cannabis patients is to wait five days before driving, or risk a fine or a suspended licence, but there is ongoing debate about how much impairment THC actually causes.  ""There's this inconsistency in Australia where we have a group of drug driving laws that really reflect what made sense for illicit cannabis or drug use,"" Professor Lintzeris says. ""Unfortunately, a THC-based medicine gets caught up in that drug driving. We have this anachronism in Australia where no other medication that's legally prescribed is subject to the same drug driving issues as medical cannabis."" It's something that proved a huge worry for Grace. ""My biggest concern was that if I was to get pulled over while driving, if I registered for THC in a random drug test, I could lose my licence,"" she says. Like Grace, Professor Lintzeris also points out that that if you're self-medicating rather than going through a doctor, there are risks. ""There's no capacity of standardisation of product or quality control, both in terms of what's in this batch, how much THC or CBD in this batch compared to the batch from last month,"" he says. Despite the legalisation of medicinal cannabis in Australia, group bodies such as the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) continue to take a cautious stance on prescribing medicinal cannabis patients, calling for more high-quality research into the safety and effectiveness of it. The RACGP pointed Life Matters to a statement, which said it doesn't ""recommend the use of cannabis products"", but does ""recognise that a specialist GP may offer to prescribe it to a limited number of patients"". How important is it to eat and sleep at the same time each day? After four months using CBD oil through an illicit producer, Grace is willing to accept the risks. ""I do find that there is little to no side-effects of using the cannabis oil — which was a concern initially — and it's a cost-effective option,"" she says. ""When I went down that [medical] channel, what I found was that there were a lot of hoops I had to jump through, a lot of paperwork, and a lot of people who had to be involved.  ""And even then if I was deemed worthy of the CBD oil, I was going to be sent this particular oil every six weeks. ""But the illegal CBD oil I got straight away, it was very easy to access and cost effective. So I opted to stay using the illegal source."" *Name changed to protect the person's identity.

7,Medicinal cannabis being used by tens of thousands of Australians as access becomes easier,Fri 11 Mar 2022 at 6:30pm,"Health Medicinal cannabis being used by tens of thousands of Australians as access becomes easier It was late 2020 when David decided to talk to his GP about getting a prescription for medicinal cannabis. He'd been diagnosed with fibromyalgia — a condition characterised by widespread pain and tenderness in the body — and had been mostly self-medicating with cannabis he'd bought illegally. ""Fibromyalgia is quite debilitating,"" he said. ""It causes random pain spots in the body … my shins will be numb and then just feel like they're on fire at the same time."" The condition, which can be difficult to diagnose, is often accompanied by fatigue and altered sleep, memory and mood. David — not his real name — says he was feeling constantly fatigued, struggling to manage his illness alongside work and taking care of his disabled partner. ""By about two o'clock in the afternoon, I just wanted to fall asleep,"" he said. After getting the green light from his GP, David began using cannabis oils and herbal products. He found they helped to ""mask the symptoms"" of fibromyalgia and improve his sleep. ""Eventually my body adjusted and I was able to just have very small amounts [of cannabis],"" he said. ""It allows me to work and go about my day, go for a walk, or do whatever I need to do."" David is one of tens of thousands of Australians who access cannabis legally. Data from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) shows prescriptions for medicinal cannabis doubled from 2020 to 2021, with more than 122,000 prescriptions written last year alone. It's a significant jump from just a few years ago. In 2018, roughly 2,500 prescriptions were written for the entire year. Melbourne GP Vicki Kotsirilos — the first authorised GP prescriber of medicinal cannabis in Australia — said prescriptions had likely increased because the TGA application process had been ""streamlined"" and patient demand had grown. ""It was exceptionally hard in the beginning. I was not able to get very many permits,"" said Dr Kotsirilos, an associate professor at Western Sydney University. ""Since the end of 2018, the TGA introduced an online permit system, and extended the duration [of permits] from three to six months to one year, and now even up to two years. ""In the past, we also had to get a permit for every single product … now, it's generically prescribed."" In other words, a GP can prescribe a product if it's based on an approved category of cannabinoid content (eg. CBD-only treatment) for that patient, rather than having to get approval for each new product. The cannabis plant (Cannabis satvia) produces hundreds of different compounds in its leaves and flowers One group of cannabis compounds are cannabinoids. More than 100 different cannabinoids have been found, including tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the chemical that gets you high Cannabidiol, also known as CBD, is another cannabinoid. It doesn't get you high, but has anti-psychotic and anti-inflammatory effects. In Australia, there are only two cannabis-based prescription medicines on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. One is prescribed to treat rare, drug-resistant forms of epilepsy that begin in childhood, the other as a muscle relaxant for people with multiple sclerosis. The vast majority of cannabis products are unregistered drugs, which require approval under the TGA's Special Access Scheme (or via its Authorised Prescriber Scheme). These products, of which there are more than 250, contain CBD or THC (or both), and come in the form of oils, capsules or dried flowers to be vaporised. Data shows most prescriptions are for chronic pain, anxiety, cancer-related symptoms, and insomnia. ""Medical cannabis is usually used as a last resort treatment, when all other proven therapies have failed,"" Dr Kotsirilos said. Jennifer Martin, physician and director of the Australian Centre for Cannabinoid Clinical and Research Excellence, said she wasn't surprised that medicinal cannabis prescriptions had increased substantially. ""The numbers have gone up exponentially, and looking at other countries, it was expected that would happen here too."" Professor Martin said the fact most prescriptions were being written for chronic pain and anxiety reflected large ""unmet health needs"" in the community. ""When we see people like this in our clinical practice, they're sometimes on seven to 10 medications and their symptoms don't go away,"" she said. ""They're sometimes just waiting for the next new chemical to arrive."" What's the evidence that CBD works, what can it be used for — and when should you steer clear? The problem, she said, was that in many cases, chronic pain and anxiety-related conditions were not ""satiated by biochemicals"" alone, and usually required psychological therapy and environmental changes to help address ""underlying issues"". ""It may just be that [medicinal cannabis] is getting them through their current situation,"" she said. ""It's not a problem in the sense that people often use chemicals in the short term to cope with things. ""But I think it's quite a big risk if people turn to unregistered products for symptom relief … and we still haven't got to the bottom of why they have so much discomfort or anxiety."" Professor Martin said many people faced limited access to mental health services and pain management support. ""The reality is, it costs a lot of money, and they have to wait six months for a [psychology] appointment. It's the same with pain clinics."" Get a selection of the best mental health content from across the ABC by subscribing to our monthly newsletter Medicinal cannabis is not considered a first-line therapy for any condition, and Dr Kotsirilos said it was critical to first explore lifestyle and behavioural changes that could alleviate symptoms of pain or anxiety. ""To address anxiety, exercise plays a really important role, as well as improving sleep and nutrition, doing things like meditation, and of course [getting] a referral to a psychologist,"" she said. ""For chronic pain, it's the same advice — lifestyle and behavioural management … can make a difference to patients' pain levels."" She said if pharmacological treatment was required, it was important to first try registered medicines such as analgesics or anti-anxiety drugs (which have been assessed for safety, quality and consistency) before considering medicinal cannabis. ""A lot of times, patients may have already tried anti-anxiety or other medication and found it limiting — they might have had side effects, weight gain, loss of appetite, or they were ineffective, and they are not interested in pursuing that,"" Dr Kotsirilos said. ""If they've explored everything, including lifestyle changes and seeing a psychologist … medicinal cannabis might be my last resort treatment."" She said she took a similar approach for patients with chronic pain, and if medicinal cannabis was suitable, always followed a method of ""start low and go slow"". ""It's more symptomatic control, so not all of them will attain 100 per cent relief. It might be 50 per cent,"" she said. ""But what it can potentially do is bring some quality of life. ""If they have less pain, they may sleep better and therefore wake up feeling better, and they are quite happy to accept that."" While the amount of scientific literature on medicinal cannabis has increased in recent years, the evidence for its use remains limited overall. ""There is evidence for some types of chronic pain, such as neuropathic pain … which people can get with diabetes and sometimes after chemotherapy,"" Professor Martin said. She added there was also some evidence for its use in people with ""existential"" distress or pain, which has been described as suffering with no clear connection to physical pain. Advocates say medicinal cannabis offers effective relief when other treatments are failing. But Australian guidelines say there's limited evidence to support its use. But Professor Martin said the data so far suggested that in most cases, medicinal cannabis was ""no better"" than existing pharmacological treatments. ""The data shows that [medicinal cannabis products] might be better for some people than placebo — so doing nothing — but they don't really show any benefit over our existing drugs,"" she said. Dr Kotsirilos agreed that there was a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of cannabis products, but noted that ""there is a growing body of research trying to backfill that absence of evidence"". ""I've had some really good success with patients who have got fibromyalgia, anxiety, difficulty sleeping and other behavioural problems,"" she said. ""Even though the evidence is not strong, there is some evidence … when it's a last resort and the patient has failed to obtain relief from the usual medication, or they've had side effects."" Because of the limited evidence base, many GPs remain cautious when it comes to prescribing medicinal cannabis. ""I can understand GPs' hesitation, especially because of the issues that we've had regarding opioid prescribing,"" Dr Kotsirilos said. ""Their concerns are justified and [medicinal cannabis] does need to be used cautiously."" Follow @abchealth on Instagram, where we're busting myths and sharing practical, smart health advice. Dr Kotsirilos said she'd like to see more research and ""better education"" for GPs on the evidence for medicinal cannabis and the potential benefits and risks associated with treatment. ""What are the safety issues? What are the risks? And what alternative treatments are there to help patients even before medicinal cannabis?"" But Professor Martin, who teaches pharmacology to GPs-in-training, said that current medical training was adequate. ""They cover all the major classes of drugs — cannabinoids are just one of many.""

8,Medicinal cannabis clinics' quality of care can be pot luck,Fri 7 Oct 2022 at 7:00pm," Medicinal cannabis clinics' quality of care can be pot luck Sitting at the dining table of a small Brisbane unit, 26-year-old father, Jordan Cooper, picks up a small piece of cannabis and begins to grind it. He places some of the herb in his vaporiser, heats it up and puts it to his lips. ""It's a full body relaxation,"" Jordan says after inhaling. In the kitchen, his fiancee, Kel, is chopping carrots. Their nine-month-old child is playing in his highchair. Jordan's supply isn't from the black market — it's medicinal cannabis, legally prescribed to him by a doctor to treat his insomnia. He says it's been life-changing. After spending years treating his condition with prescription medicines which left him feeling groggy the next day, Jordan decided to self-medicate with illegally-sourced cannabis. It worked well, without the side effects. He then saw some stories about legal medicinal cannabis, and decided to go to his GP to seek a prescription. ""I didn't really think that I was going to be eligible,"" he says. ""It turns out I was."" While his doctor told him it's OK to try the treatment, they weren't comfortable prescribing it themselves. So Jordan did a quick search online to try to find a doctor willing to prescribe cannabis. One of the companies at the top of the search results was Australian business, Cannatrek. Founded in 2015, Cannatrek was one of the first companies to receive a medicinal cannabis licence in Australia. Today it is the most popular supplier on the market. According to pharmaceutical intelligence company, NostraData, around one third of medicinal cannabis products sold at retail pharmacies are Cannatrek products. Jordan's experience with Cannatrek began with a referral service — Cannatrek Access. There, he was asked to fill in a questionnaire and put through an initial screening call in early 2021. To be eligible he had to have had a chronic health condition for more than three months, have tried conventional treatments, and be an Australian resident. Once he established he met the eligibility criteria, Cannatrek Access referred him to a clinic in Victoria which offered a 15-minute phone consultation with a doctor who prescribed him a cannabis flower and an oil. By the end of the year, Jordan had spent $400 on virtual appointments with this clinic and $625 on five cannabis products — all of them from Cannatrek. ""I did ask about other brands and yeah, that doctor told me that they just solely do Cannatrek products,"" he says. ""It may have changed now."" Background Briefing contacted the doctor to ask him why he only prescribed Cannatrek products to Jordan. He said there was never any overt pressure to prescribe the brand, but the company was really helpful. ""If you have received a referral from a particular company, it's only fair to prescribe that product if it is appropriate for the patient clinically and economically,"" the doctor said. Cannatrek founder and CEO Tommy Huppert says the company does not pressure or incentivise doctors to prescribe its medications. ""The reason why we've been successful is we've made sure we've had inventory in the country, [plus] the quality and the price,"" he says. Prescribing cannabis is not as straightforward as prescribing regular medication because unlike most drugs, it is not an approved therapy — this means it hasn't gone through rigorous clinical trials to prove that it is safe and effective. So doctors have to get permission from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to prescribe it. That's where Cannatrek can step in, by sponsoring doctors to become TGA-approved prescribers. ""[In Australia] we have … over 1,000 approved prescribers,"" Mr Huppert says. ""Cannatrek has educated and sponsored approximately 40 per cent of those approved prescribers."" While educating doctors may be one part of Cannatrek's success, others in the industry say the company's dominance is in part due to a willingness to push the TGA's advertising rules to the limit, or even past breaking point. In Australia it is illegal to advertise certain therapeutic goods, like prescription drugs or unapproved medicines such as medicinal cannabis, directly to consumers. That's because the decision to take prescription medication should be made with a doctor, not because of consumer advertising. Background Briefing found several examples of Cannatrek advertising that appeared to be directed at potential patients, including social media posts, a crowdfunding campaign offering a free consultation and product discounts, and an advertorial through social news website LADbible Australia. When we put some of the content to Mr Huppert, he said the company works collaboratively with the TGA and that the advertising rules were ""a very difficult interpretive minefield"". ""We believe that we have the responsibility to make the public aware of the category, and it just so happens that it is coming from our company,"" he says. IVF is big business in Australia. But in the quest to innovate, one company may have gone too far. Less than a month after Mr Huppert's interview with Background Briefing, the TGA announced Cannatrek had been handed a $293,040 fine for 22 alleged advertising breaches. While Cannatrek had made it relatively simple for Jordan to find his first clinic, he gradually became frustrated with the advice he was receiving from the doctors. ""[They] weren't overly knowledgeable"", he says. ""So, at that point, I wanted to see what else was out there."" Within weeks, Jordan found himself in a telehealth consultation with CDA Clinics – a specialist cannabis prescriber offering in-person appointments in Queensland and telehealth appointments across Australia. During his first appointment, Jordan was told he might be eligible for the clinic's ""special treatment program"". Once in, he would gain extraordinary control over which cannabis products to order. Previously, Jordan had been prescribed specific products chosen by his doctor. Now, he could pick and choose from an array of cannabis buds via an online catalogue, as long as he didn't go over a monthly ordering limit. ""I just called up and said I wanted to order, and paid,"" he says. ""I had full control."" Despite only using an average of five grams a month at his previous clinic, during his second appointment at CDA, Jordan was given an ordering limit of 60 grams of cannabis flower a month. While that may seem excessive, Jordan says he had been unsuccessfully trying to get more products at the Cannatrek Access clinic. When he asked to be sent a possession letter detailing his prescription ahead of a trip, he was surprised to find a doctor had further increased his monthly limit to 90 grams, without discussing it with him. ""It's odd,"" he says. ""To prescribe people a bunch more than what they're actually using is dangerous. It's just asking for it to be diverted to the black market."" This isn't just theoretical. Background Briefing has seen evidence of medicinal cannabis products being sold via encrypted messaging apps at up to four times the retail price. In December 2021, CDA merged with ASX-listed company, Cronos. A spokesperson for Cronos said the company was ""not aware of such a site"" but it took the onselling of its products in illegal markets ""very seriously"". The spokesperson said the special treatment program was set up at a time when there were ""serious out-of-stock issues compromising patient treatment"" as an ""effort to ensure more consistent supply"" to patients. They also said medical practitioners were ""always overseeing the process and approving individual patient prescriptions"". In August, CDA tightened up the special treatment program, after the TGA made it easier to change products when there are stock outages. Patients are now limited to four different cannabis flower products at any one time and can only make one product change per month after a medical review. CDA makes money from the wholesale and distribution of products. So the more products the company moves, the more money it makes. And this raises a question about conflict of interest for doctors who happen to be both investors in the company and prescribers of its products. A spokesperson for CDA's parent company told Background Briefing its doctors are required to prescribe using their own independent judgement. ""Our doctors are not incentivised in any way to prescribe one product over another. They are paid to provide a service,"" a spokesperson said. ""Everything we do is governed by transparency, accountability and adherence to the laws that govern the prescribing of medicines."" The potential for a conflict of interest has been particularly acute for CDA doctors who are also substantial shareholders in the company, such as co-founder, Dr Ben Jansen. He has been described by the company as ""arguably Australia's most experienced medicinal cannabis clinician, having been directly involved with the treatment of thousands of patients"". Prison authorities know that drugs are constantly finding their way into our prisons. When Dr Jansen prescribed cannabis at CDA clinics,most of the time, the company he co-founded made money. Jordan had a few consults with Dr Jansen. He couldn't recall him disclosing this conflict of interest, but says it could have happened. ""They weren't long calls anyway … maybe a few minutes,"" he says. Dr Jansen was also the clinician who signed the possession letter noting the increase in Jordan's order limit from 60 to 90 grams. Background Briefing contacted Dr Jansen directly but he did not respond to questions. However, a spokesperson for CDA's parent company, Cronos, said their doctors always disclosed their conflicts of interest. ""CDA patients are required to provide informed consent prior to treatment by signing a patient consent form, which states: I acknowledge that my cannabis doctor and this practice may have an interest in MC [Medicinal Cannabis] and hemp companies … Furthermore, I acknowledge that my prescription, treatments or recommendations may benefit the CDA Group and/or this practice,"" the statement said. ""This is also stated by the applicable doctor at the beginning of the consultation, verbally."" The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) has serious concerns about medicinal cannabis clinics being run by companies with a financial interest in cannabis products. ""The issue with it is that there might be some decisions that are made for commercial reasons rather than best patient care,"" RACGP addiction medicine specialist, Dr Hester Wilson, says. Dr Wilson says where there are conflicts of interest they need to be clearly disclosed in appointments, not just in the fine print. ""My concern is that this potentially is a group of people who are quite vulnerable, they have significant illness, they may not have a great deal of money,"" she says. ""They also may not have all the information that they need to make informed choice, and really … we want there to be informed choice for people."" Background Briefing is daring narrative journalism — Australian investigations with impact. Follow the podcast to listen for free on your mobile device. The RACGP believes if most medicinal cannabis products were registered pharmaceuticals not experimental unapproved therapies, these closed-loop set-ups wouldn't be accepted, even with clear disclosures. ""It's not done as far as I'm aware,"" Dr Wilson says. ""[It] is very concerning that these closed systems of only promoting your particular product are allowed to flourish because of the different way that cannabis is allowed into Australia. ""I am supportive of cannabis being available but it really needs to … be a very clear, transparent process."" A CDA spokesperson told Background Briefing, ""Like many other Australian companies, we are working within the framework to provide patients in need with Medical Cannabis treatments"". Medicinal cannabis advocate, Lucy Haslam, says while cannabis clinics have helped facilitate access, she now fears some are having a negative impact on patients. ""While you have patients that are basically being fleeced … it does need some urgent action,"" the Chair of the Australian Medicinal Cannabis Association says. Ms Haslam is calling for greater transparency and more independent clinics, saying it will serve both patients and the industry. ""Where there is vested commercial interest or … prescribing of products that are not necessarily the best product for the patient, but based more on the financial interests of the prescriber, I think that doesn't sit well with anybody and it shouldn't be allowed to happen,"" she says. Dr Laurence Kemp is Head of Medical at specialist cannabis clinic, Cann I Help, and a minor shareholder in its parent company. Like some of his colleagues working in cannabis clinics, he's calling for a tightening of the sector's regulation. ""I think more oversight and a set of standards that were specific to doctors working within cannabis care would be really useful,"" he says. Dr Kemp is calling for the introduction of guidelines for cannabis clinicians, similar to those set by the RACGP for general practitioners. ""They make it really clear what's expected of care and how you set up a practice and how you run a practice,"" he says. ""I think what I would probably like to see within the cannabis industry is a similar set of standards about how practices are run."" In the meantime, for patients, finding quality cannabis care can be trial and error. Jordan has now left CDA and isn't involved with another closed-loop cannabis clinic. Instead, he is seeing an independent cannabis doctor who does telehealth from Victoria. ""I felt confident that they knew what they were doing and that I was in much better hands.""

9,How basketball legend Lauren Jackson won the battle against prescription painkillers with medicinal cannabis,Sun 5 Dec 2021 at 7:59pm,"Sport How basketball legend Lauren Jackson won the battle against prescription painkillers with medicinal cannabis Lauren Jackson was just six years old when she played her first game of competitive basketball for a local under-10 side in her hometown of Albury, New South Wales. Unbeknown to those watching, this basketball prodigy was destined for greatness. The first Australian player ever to be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Jackson is regarded as one of the world's best female basketballers of all time. ""It feels like a bit of a dream now, it really does,"" Jackson said. ""I feel like a completely different person, which I am, but looking back I was so fortunate to have played basketball at that level and to have competed at such a high level for so long."" A two-time WNBA champion with the Seattle Storm (2004 and 2010), three-time MVP (2003, 2007, 2010), seven-time WNBA All-Star and overall number-one pick in the 2001 draft, Jackson also won four Olympic medals (three silver and one bronze) and guided the Opals to a coveted World Cup victory in 2006. But a degenerative knee injury cut her phenomenal career short, forcing her to retire in early 2016, denying Jackson what would have been a fifth Olympics in Rio. ""It didn't end the way I wanted it [to],"" she said. ""There were highs and some pretty big lows as well."" Jackson underwent countless surgeries during her career and often resorted to painkillers. Chronic, debilitating pain around her knee, hip and lower back continued to plague her after she retired. ""I've been open about my battle with prescription medication during my career and when I retired, I went off everything because I wanted to raise my kids and just be the very best version of myself."" After consulting her GP, Jackson explored alternative treatments to pain and was prescribed medical cannabis. ""It's been incredible,"" she said. ""It's helped me a lot and gotten me to the point where I'm able to train again and live a very active lifestyle with my two little boys."" Jackson is part of a new Sport Advisory Board, run by Melbourne-based sports medicine company, Levin group, that develops pharmaceutical-grade medicinal cannabis for the treatment of chronic pain and concussion. She hopes her personal experiences will help reduce the stigma associated with medicinal cannabis. ""It's something that I personally believe in because of how my body has handled it,"" she said. ""I just want to help get the message out there and hopefully help change people's lives."" Dr Rowena Mobbs, a neurologist from Macquarie University, claims there's mounting evidence for cannabinoid therapies and medicinal cannabis use for chronic pain. ""But as far as management of head injury and concussion in general, this is really the new kid on the block,"" she said. Dr Mobbs works with concussion patients on a regular basis, including athletes with multiple concussion and repeated head traumas. ""We see this [medicinal cannabis] debate in epilepsy and pain management and understand people would want to try every option,"" she said. Advocates say medicinal cannabis offers effective relief when other treatments are failing. But Australian guidelines say there's limited evidence to support its use. Medicinal cannabis was first raised as a potential therapeutic option in the 1930s and there's evidence of cannabis first being used medicinally as far back as 400 AD. ""In head trauma, we're interested as researchers in understanding it may have a benefit but it's still early days,"" Dr Mobbs said. ""We're yet to see the detailed trials come out for cannabinoid but certainly the theory is there in that many regions of the brain contain cannabinoid receptor Type 1."" Another area being explored is whether it may have potential benefits, as an add on or third line therapy. This is where alternative therapies are considered, after a patient develops resistance to initial and secondary treatment options. ""We see patients more than a year after their concussion, truly in the post-concussion syndrome, where they've tried post traumatic migraine therapies without success,"" Dr Mobbs said. ""So, these people may wish to reach out to cannabinoid therapies and medicinal cannabis."" Like any form of medication, there can be side effects involving short-term memory and concentration.  ""We think largely cannabinoid therapies are safe but there can be side effects such as changes in sleep patterns, appetite, nausea and higher doses can have intoxicating effects,"" she said. More severe psychological side effects can include paranoia and agitation, but these are rare at low doses. For those wishing to explore medical cannabis for chronic pain or concussion related injuries, Dr Mobbs recommends chatting to your local GP and carefully considering all options. It's a sentiment echoed by Jackson, who is finally loving life after basketball. ""I've got two little boys who are starting to figure out that mummy was a basketball player and I get to share those stories with them and watch YouTube clips, which is pretty fun,"" she said. Though it may not be long before we see another basketball prodigy. ""My little bloke is actually playing hoops, which is pretty cool and I'm like the mum in the corner cheering him on.

10,Desperate patients turn to black market for medicinal cannabis despite spike in legal prescriptions,Fri 22 Feb 2019 at 6:30pm," Desperate patients turn to black market for medicinal cannabis despite spike in legal prescriptions It was the day Michael Lambert watched his infant daughter suffer a violent two-and-a-half-hour seizure that he says he decided breaking the law was a small price to pay for her life. Katelyn had been diagnosed with a severe form of epilepsy known as Dravet Syndrome and her family was told there was a one-in-six chance she would be dead before she turned 18.  ""They told me, 'Go out and have as much fun as you can with this child now, just forget she's got epilepsy, because you don't know how long you'll have with her',"" Mr Lambert said.  At just 11 months old, Katelyn could have seizures every 15-20 seconds and for hours on end. Now seven, she averages one a year.  Her father said he believed this was because he had been giving her five drops of illegal cannabis oil every day for nearly five years.  Katelyn's paediatrician and neurologist admitted she had shown dramatic improvements.  ""Before then I thought I'd be arrested but all of a sudden I thought, 'Damn it, I'm watching my daughter die in front of me, I've got to break the law',"" Mr Lambert said.  Earlier this week, the ABC revealed more than 3,000 medicinal cannabis scripts had been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) from March 2018 to January 2019.  But conservative estimates suggested up to 100,000 Australians were still using it illegally to self-medicate. Advocates said this was an indication the system was failing.  The Federal Government announced a streamlined application process for medicinal cannabis last year, which would allow approved patients to get access to the drug in 48 hours. But Mr Lambert disputed claims the process had been made easier. ""Everybody knows from the Health Minister to the Prime Minister, I wrote to them all, I begged for help,"" he said.  ""They told me, 'We're going to come up with a solution, just hang in tight', but I'm worried that the next package is not going to arrive, that my daughter's going to get electrocuted to death in front of me, because she's missing the most vital ingredient in her medicines.""  In theory, a patient like Katelyn had several options to obtain medicinal cannabis.  The first was to get on a clinical trial.  Christian Read insists while medical medicinal cannabis can't cure him of the pain he experiences, it grants him some relief. One underway in New South Wales is investigating the impact of cannabis on children with severe treatment-resistant epilepsy.  But limited spots meant only about 100 children had access to it, and Katelyn was not on the list.  Another option was to find a doctor who was an Authorised Prescriber (AP) of a specific cannabis medicine.  To become an AP, however, a medical practitioner must complete a rigorous application process, get approval from the Therapeutic Goods Association, obtain endorsement from an ethics committee, check for additional state or territory requirements and provide the drug supplier their authorisation.  But privacy laws did not allow people to search for an AP.  The third pathway, under the Special Access Scheme (SAS), allowed practitioners in most states and territories to apply for Commonwealth and state approval in an online application.  However, some found it difficult to find a doctor willing to go through this process.  Dr Sanjay Nijhawan from Cannabis Access Clinics said a lack of awareness had discouraged doctors from engaging with it.  ""We have not educated our GPs, the medical schools don't know enough about it … at the moment it's pretty raw, it's early days,"" he said.  Katelyn's current dose of MediCabilis had been obtained through the SAS and did not come cheap.  Mr Lambert said a bottle that would last his daughter four days cost $585.  ""The minimum dose recommended on the bottle is $140 a day and I can get it [for] $7.50 a day on the black market,"" he said.  ""I've got three choices — don't give it to her and injure her, keep breaking the law or what extra job am I going to get to pay for it?""  Rhys Cohen from Sydney University's Lambert Institute for Cannabinoid Therapeutics said high costs were driven by a lack of transparency around the supply chain for these products.  ""There might be a cultivator overseas, a manufacturer, an international distributor, a local distributor and a pharmacy … all taking their cut,"" he said.  ""I think it's fair to say Australians are getting gouged by some opportunists.""  Carol Ireland from Epilepsy Action Australia said she had seen a change in attitude toward cannabis as a viable treatment in the past five years.  She conceded the system had left parents like Mr Lambert with minimal options.   ""They're not hippies, they're not people who are living alternative lifestyles and they're not people who want to break the law — they're families between a rock and a hard place,"" she said. Mr Lambert paid for his actions when he was found guilty in 2017 of possession and cultivation of cannabis, but said he had no regrets. ""She has catastrophic epilepsy, the side effect is she gets her life back, she doesn't get brain damage, she can live, she can breathe, and they can't stop it but I can with a little bit of hemp,"" he said. A 2017 review from the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre found that the strongest evidence for medicinal cannabis was in children and young adults with drug-resistant epilepsy, for which CBD products had been shown to reduce the frequency of seizures by 50 per cent or more in up to half of paediatric patients. The review also found there was limited evidence about the effectiveness of medicinal cannabis for use in different medical conditions, and little was known about the most suitable doses of individual cannabis products.  Professor Jennifer Martin, director of the Australian Centre for Cannabinoid Clinical and Research Excellence, said when it came to the scientific evidence behind medicinal cannabis, the picture was mixed. ""The evidence of non-cancer pain is actually not that strong. There was a big review in the US a few years ago, which suggested there would be some benefit for some patients,"" she said. She said it was better for patients to use drugs that had been registered by the TGA first, before trialling medicinal cannabis. Professor Martin said the scientific evidence of benefits was stronger for treating conditions such as kids with epilepsy who had not responded to medication.  Lucy Haslam, who has been spearheading the movement for access to medicinal cannabis since 2013, said she was ""bitterly disappointed"" by the state of the current laws. Her son Dan was a fierce advocate for the medicine and died aged 25, a year before Australia's laws were passed.  ""I used to be proud of what we'd done but nothing much has changed for patients,"" she said. ""We find that the Government's trying to put a lot of spin on it and claim it's been victorious, but it's been a disaster."" She has joined Greens leader Richard Di Natale in calling for the establishment of a national regulator.  ""Every other country with a sophisticated cannabis program has elected to set about doing it through an independent regulator. That's what we should've done,"" she said.  The now defunct Greens Bill was introduced to parliament in 2014 and would have allowed for the creation of a single body in charge of approving, licensing, importing and exporting medicinal cannabis.   The Federal and New South Wales Health Ministers both declined to comment.

11,Mysterious pink glow over town confirmed as medicinal cannabis facility lighting,Wed 20 Jul 2022 at 12:39am," Mysterious pink glow over town confirmed as medicinal cannabis facility lighting An eerie pink light rippled across the cloudy night sky in Mildura on Tuesday night, sending the town's rumour mill into overdrive. ""I read about a potential solar flare due to hit on Tuesday,"" said one user on Facebook — not cannabis. ""Portal to the time-space continuum …"" said another. ""Kenny Rogers Roasters opening in Mildura?"" offered yet another, in a reference to Seinfeld. But all the tongue-in-cheek theories were put to bed this morning when Cann Group told ABC Mildura-Swan Hill they were the source of the pink glow. CEO Peter Crock told ABC Mildura-Swan Hill Breakfast this morning that last night's Aurora marijuanis were the lights on in Cann Group's new area of its medicinal cannabis facility. ""As you might know, cannabis grows on an extended day length. The flowering zone is 12 hours light and 12 hours dark, which is normally 7am to 7pm,"" he said. ""With the new zone coming into use in the next day or two, we have had the lights on. ""Normally, the blackout blinds close at the same time as the sun sets, but last night we had the lights on and the blinds hadn't yet closed, so there was a period where it created a glow. ""At 7pm when we put the plants to sleep the lights went off."" When asked if Cann Group had any unusual enquiries after the sighting, Mr Crock replied ""our overnight security did report some activity"". He said the glow from the facility was a once off. Mr Crock said the water-cooled LED lights operated on a different wavelength to most lights, which is why they glow pink. The facility's location has traditionally been undisclosed. Despite a pink glow giving major hints as to the facility's location, Mr Crock said he would not divulge where exactly it is in Mildura. ""I had a quick look [at pictures on social media] this morning, and there are some beautiful images,"" he said. Local resident Jake Moore, who lives near the facility, went for a drive with his children to check out the glow. Mr Moore took several photos widely shared on local social media. Cann Group's medicinal cannabis was approved for sale in Australia earlier this month. ABC Mildura Swan Hill will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Wednesday.

12,Andrew Forrest tips $5 million into medicinal cannabis company,"November 22, 2021 — 3.32pm","We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 1 year ago Andrew Forrest is the latest billionaire to enter the medicinal cannabis arena with a $5 million share placement by his family’s investment arm Tattarang into Perth-based health technology company Emyria. Dr Forrest’s foray into medicinal cannabis comes a few months after fellow iron ore magnate Gina Rinehart put $15 million behind the European expansion of another player, Little Green Pharma, in the growing sector. Andrew Forrest’s family investment arm Tattarang has put $5 million behind a Perth company in the medicinal cannabis industry.Credit:Dominic Lorrimer Emyria was listed on the ASX last year, just before Australia was plunged into the global COVID-19 pandemic, and has been progressing with trials of a synthetic cannabinoid targeting mental health which it hopes to have registered domestically and in the American market. The small company has seven patient-treating clinics around Australia which it uses to progress the development and registration of new drugs. Emyria managing director Michael Winlo said the company has treated more than 5000 people through its cannabinoid program and was preparing for an MDMA trial next year to help treat post-traumatic stress disorder. Dr Winlo said the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) was set to make a decision next month on whether MDMA would be reclassified from a schedule nine drug – which are prohibited substances – down to a controlled drug as a schedule eight. “In light of the evidence and the growing recognition of major mental health disorders and the need for more treatment options. I think there will be a very persuasive argument in front of the TGA,” he said. Dr Winlo said a MDMA clinical trial would be able to go ahead regardless of the TGA’s decision. Tattarang chief investment officer John Hartman said the investment by Emyria into “industry-leading” data collection would allow it to innovate faster than other companies and bring online new treatments quickly and cost-effectively. “We believe evidence-based, and properly registered, medicinal cannabis and novel psychedelic treatments have massive growth potential across global healthcare jurisdictions,” he said. “Emyria’s data-driven approach positions it strongly to lead the accelerated development and registration of new treatment options that can potentially benefit millions of patients.” The investment by Tattarang has seen it take a 7 per cent share in Emyria. Dr Winlo said it was great to have a long-term thinking and supportive investor which would bring a lot more than just funds to Emyria’s story. There has been a concerted lobbying push in the past few years to reclassify psychedelic drugs psilocybin, found in magic mushrooms, and MDMA, found in ecstasy, to be used in clinical settings. Former federal trade minister Andrew Robb has been one of the leading voices for change through his board role on Mind Medicine Australia. The TGA made an interim decision in February not to reclassify psilocybin and MDMA. Copyright © 2023",9,491
13,Calls to exclude medicinal cannabis users from new SA drug-driving rules,Mon 13 Feb 2023 at 8:36am," Calls to exclude medicinal cannabis users from new SA drug-driving rules Concerns have been raised for thousands of South Australians using medicinal cannabis as strict new road laws, which could see them stripped of their licence immediately, come into effect today. Motorists caught with drugs in their system in South Australia will now have their driver's licence immediately stripped as new powers are handed to SA police officers. Dean of Law at Southern Cross University and campaign lead for Drive Change, David Heilpern, urged Police Minister Joe Szakacs to allow an amendment for people with a THC prescription from a doctor. ""The forgotten people in these laws are these tens of thousands of South Australians who are taking prescriptions with very small quantities of THC in their system,"" Mr Heilpern said. ""For those South Australians who are relying on THC to assist them with a whole range of medical conditions, they'll be left with immediate suspension of their licence before they have a chance to go to court."" In Tasmania, there is an exemption for motorists who test positive to THC at a roadside drug test if they have a prescription for medicinal cannabis. The SA Greens have joined calls to review the laws. Mr Szackas said there were no plans to make the exemption. ""I don't have an optimistic answer for those people who met with me or with advocates … the advice that I have received to date is such that we will be sticking with this model,"" Mr Szakacs said. Mr Heilpern said there were more than 200,000 Australians with a prescription to use medicinal cannabis. ""These people who are using these drugs are not having three bongs before driving on the road,"" he said. ""They're going to their doctor with a chronic ailment and they're getting a prescription."" Mr Szackas said roadside drug tests only showed results for THC, meth, and MDMA due to technology limits. ""Our government is incredibly open-minded and responds where it can if there is new technology that enables us to test for other drugs, and we'll of course always be open-minded to reforming the law if we can,"" he said. ""We know it's not just these three drugs that can cause impairment.""

14,"Medicinal cannabis regulation costing patients $600 a month, forcing some to turn to the black market",Thu 20 Feb 2020 at 2:51am," Medicinal cannabis regulation costing patients $600 a month, forcing some to turn to the black market Every morning, Brent Arcuri uses a glass pipette to carefully drop a small dose of cannabis oil under his tongue. The 20-year-old from the Gold Coast suffers from Crohn's Disease, an inflammation of the bowel that makes digesting any food a painful chore. ""Every day I wake up I have some sort of pain purely from eating food,"" Mr Arcuri told 7.30.  ""It can cause me to be very fatigued all the time."" After years of trialling various medications with limited success, a friend suggested he try medicinal cannabis.  Last year, Mr Arcuri was prescribed a cannabis oil product from his doctor. Seeking cannabis oil for medical purposes has been legal since 2016 when federal laws were changed to allow doctors to prescribe cannabis products to patients suffering an array of conditions. ""It's only after you get accepted, they tell you the associated costs,"" said Mr Arcuri, who was initially paying around $600 a month for medicinal cannabis. He soon discovered he could buy cannabis oil for roughly a quarter that price on the black market, importing it from a US-based website. There is currently no subsidy for cannabis products under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).  Doctors wishing to prescribe it must first apply to the Therapeutic Goods Administration to seek individual patient approval, a time-consuming process that provides further motivation for patients to access cannabis products via illegitimate routes. But the licensed cannabis industry warns there is no guarantee of purity or safety with black market products.  Fleta Solomon runs a pharmaceutical company at a secret facility south of Perth that farms cannabis to make legal medicinal oil, one of the first of its kind in Australia. ""In comparison to growing in a backyard, we have complete control over the environment,"" Ms Solomon said. This ensures product consistency and allows growers to continually test the plants for contaminants, bacteria and mould. The strict regulations that Ms Solomon's company must adhere to, combined with higher production costs, means their product is more expensive than those available on the black market. According to John Skerritt, head of the TGA, the process of listing cannabis products under the PBS is underway but may take some time. ""The situation we're working towards is for clinical trials to be done and companies to put submissions to us,"" Professor Skerritt said. ""But those trials take a couple of years, and then they have to get the results and submit them, as they do for any other medicine."" A Senate inquiry is now looking into problems with access and regulation of the industry as a whole. Melbourne mother Emma Broughan relies on cannabis to relieve chronic pain caused by a car accident in 2015. ""It changed my life in so many different ways, not just the physical. Obviously it hurts. It hurts a lot every day,"" she said. Like Mr Arcuri, Ms Broughan was prescribed cannabis oil by her doctor but was simply unable to afford the prescription. ""It would have ended up costing me a third of my income basically, my pension, to go on this medication,"" she said. Ms Broughan believes she is left with no other option than to purchases cannabis products from the black market, a practice which leaves her feeling judged.  While prescriptions for medicinal cannabis are available, Ms Broughan believes the high price means the product remains inaccessible for many Australians.  ""It's set up so we'd fail. Here it is, but we can't have it. There is no way I could afford that product,"" she said. Mr Arcuri hopes the Senate inquiry will prompt desperately needed change for patients. ""What I hope is that it shifts a bit more of the conversation about the issue,"" he said.  ""It is something that could potentially help millions of more Australians that are not even aware of it at this point."" Despite the experiences of people like Mr Arcuri, there is currently limited scientific evidence that medicinal cannabis is effective against chronic pain.

15,"More than half of prescriptions for medicinal cannabis in Australia given in Queensland, study says",,"Anxiety and sleep disorders were some reasons given for prescriptions despite lack of evidence for cannabis treatment, researchers find More than half of all prescriptions for medicinal cannabis in Australia are written by doctors in Queensland, with prescriptions often given for conditions there is little evidence medicinal cannabis can treat, new research reveals. Medicinal cannabis products such as capsules, creams, oils, lozenges, sprays and granulated flowers were approved for prescription 159,665 times between the start of Australia’s medicinal cannabis program in February 2016 and September 2021, research led by the University of Sydney’s Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics shows. Data obtained through a freedom of information request to drugs regulator the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) revealed the age of those prescribed the drugs, the reason for prescribing, and the state or territory where the prescription was made. Some of this information has since been made publicly available on the TGA’s Medicinal Cannabis Access Data Dashboard – revealing approved medicinal cannabis prescriptions have now reached more than 247,000 – though the data published is not as detailed as that obtained by the researchers. The researchers’ analysis found anxiety was the reason given for 16% of medicinal cannabis prescriptions. Flower-based medicinal cannabis prescriptions for anxiety were most common, despite a lack of high-quality clinical studies showing treatments made from the flower of the cannabis plant are effective for the condition. Pain was the most common reason for medicinal cannabis being prescribed (61% of prescriptions), and 5.7% of prescriptions were for sleep disorders. The data also shows that prior to 2020, people between 45 and 52 years old had the highest incidence of prescriptions. After 2020, those between 20 and 31 years old were the predominant group being prescribed medicinal cannabis. Queensland was the source of 51% of prescriptions between 2016 and 2021. The lead author of the study, Sara MacPhail, said it is unclear why the age demographic had changed, or why so many prescriptions were being made in Queensland. These were findings that need further study, she said. Dr Elizabeth Cairns, a co-author on the paper, said another interesting but unexplained finding was that prescriptions of topical creams containing CBD, a chemical found in cannabis, were being written for convulsions. “This usage has not been extensively explored,” Cairns said. “We are aware of clinical trials in that space, but not strong evidence.” The findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Frontiers in Pharmacology. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) president, Adjunct Prof Karen Prince, said the findings were worrying. “The quality of evidence varies and in some cases is inconclusive or insufficient to suggest any benefit to patients,” she said. “The RACGP is also very concerned about the emergence of online prescription services and business models offering medicinal cannabis in Australia, which may be contributing to the nature of prescriptions. There are numerous risks to these ‘on demand’ types of services, including misdiagnosis and missed opportunities for preventative care. They won’t have the patient’s medical history.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The use of medicinal cannabis to treat pain is controversial in Australia. The Australian Faculty of Pain Medicine suggests cannabinoid products should not be prescribed to treat chronic non-cancer pain, unless the patient is being treated as part of a registered clinical trial so that better evidence can be gathered. Few studies have been done examining cannabis for the treatment of sleep disorders. “However, both the medical practitioner and the TGA are involved in the prescription and approval of medicinal cannabis under the special access scheme in Australia, so it’s gone through rounds of approval before going to the patient,” Cairns said. “So I think medicinal cannabis is often seen as that last resort when other treatments have failed.” Prof Jennifer Martin, a clinical pharmacologist, physician, and chief investigator with the Australia Centre for Cannabinoid Clinical and Research Excellence, said although doctors may feel they are prescribing as a “last resort”, it can be difficult to say no to a distressed and ill patient. There could be many barriers to patients trying more evidence-based treatments such as multi-disciplinary pain clinics, psychotherapy or exercise programs, she said. “Some of those programs take a real investment from the patient to commit to them over time, and often people can’t get into the programs because there’s a waitlist, or due to cost,” Martin said. She said in New South Wales, the chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, had secured government funding for the NSW Cannabis Medicines Advisory Service, which gives advice and evidence-based information to doctors. “A lot of doctors end up not going ahead with the prescription after getting advice from the service,” Martin said. “Sometimes the patient was not aware that medicinal cannabis products could worsen their condition. This might also be why prescriptions are lower in NSW than Queensland.”",15,812
16,"Driving under the influence of medical cannabis is illegal, but patients are still taking the risk",Sat 28 Sep 2019 at 10:16pm," Driving under the influence of medical cannabis is illegal, but patients are still taking the risk When the pain gets too bad, Julie* puts a couple of drops of cannabis oil under her tongue, to ease her chronic pain and help her sleep. It contains a low dose of THC — the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis.  Certainly not enough to get her anywhere near stoned, she says. ""Oh God, no. No way. I can barely tell the difference,"" she said. ""I don't like feeling stoned, I don't like smoking pot. It's definitely not about getting high."" And when she wakes up and drives to work, she knows she is breaking the law.  In Victoria, as in all Australian states, driving with any THC in your system is a criminal offence. ""I would never take it just before I hop into a car,"" Julie says. ""I just think if I get busted, I get busted, and I'll argue my case in court because I think the laws are stupid."" But cannabis patients who ignore the standard medical advice to wait five days before driving are risking more than a fine or a suspended licence. If they are involved in an accident, their insurance will be voided.  If another person is injured, they could face criminal charges of driving while impaired. Karen Hitchcock is a pain specialist who prescribes cannabis and says it is an extremely difficult decision for her patients to make. ""By the time they wake up in the morning, they won't be impaired at all, just as you wouldn't be if you had a few glasses of wine the night before, but they are still unable to drive for five days,"" Dr Hitchcock said. ""Often, people choose not to take the medicine because it results in such a huge decrease in their independence. ""I've had patients who have come to me on high doses of opioids and Valium, and they gradually use cannabis to wean off their other medications.  ""But because they can't tolerate the prohibition on driving, they say, 'I'm just going to go back on my opiates and Valium'."" The growth in medical cannabis has been astonishing. At the beginning of last year, there were around five applications per month approved for medical cannabis products. By December, it had rocketed up to 141. That has bumped up against the toughest roadside drug testing regime in the world, which is also expanding. Law Institute of Victoria president Stuart Webb says it is slightly anomalous. ""Other countries have looked at this and have provided some provision for people to drive with a level of THC with the blood system,"" he said. ""I think that we need to look at that."" Reason Party MP Fiona Patten says cannabis is being treated differently under the law to other prescriptions drugs like opioids and benzodiazepines. ""Cannabis is the only prescription medication that excludes you 100 per cent from driving,"" she said. ""There's an easy fix to this: include medicinal cannabis patients in our Road Safety Act to say that someone who is found to have a presence of THC is not breaking the law, unless they are driving when impaired."" Until then, other patients, like Josh Gatehouse, decide the trade-off is worth it. Mr Gatehouse, who has autism, gave up driving when he started taking a low THC oil to bring is racing thoughts under control. It has enabled him to settle into study for the first time in his life. ""I just feel like I'm finally on a path somewhere,"" he said.  ""I've being drifting for so long."" But in a small country town, giving up driving is a huge decision.  The daily trip to TAFE used to be a 20-minute drive. Now, he has to take two buses each way. ""Yeah, it's inconvenient,"" he said. ""But I've never had this focus for a course — or anything before — in my life. And there are too many pros to outweigh the disadvantage of not having a licence."" His mother Margaret is close to tears when she talks about the change in her son. ""It's been a real game-changer for him. It really has,"" she said. ""I think it's a bit crazy, really, that they're not letting people drive. His medication has a very low level of THC. ""People are allowed to have a small amount of alcohol without it impairing them. I imagine that having a small amount of THC would be a similar thing. Perhaps even less of an impairment."" ""Do we want every patient who's taking medicinal cannabis to never drive? I mean, that's not feasible,"" said Professor Iain McGregor, from the Lambert Initiative into Cannabinoid Therapeutics at the University of New South Wales. ""Rather, we have to use science to look at impairment and the complex relationship between THC levels in your body and driving performance, rather than just having a very simplistic view that if you have THC in your saliva, you should be off the road."" But leaving that decision in the hands of drivers is a move cautioned against by Michael Fitzharris, associate director of Monash University's Accident Research Centre. ""They actually have that artificial feeling of wellbeing,"" Associate Professor Fitzharris says. ""While the skills that they need — like concentration and reaction time, when you need to respond — aren't always there."" ""And that starts to present as a road safety problem, which is why it remains illegal to drive with any cannabis on board."" Mr Gatehouse has his own idea for a solution — re-testing medical cannabis patients while they are on their medication. ""I could go back and do the same tests that I did in the first place to check whether I'm capable of driving and reassess my ability as a patient,"" he said. ""It's like alcohol prohibition ending at the moment. Everybody's scrambling to see how it all fits together in the system."" *Name has been changed to protect the person's identity.

18,Patients ask 60 per cent of GPs about medicinal cannabis,Tue 3 Jul 2018 at 8:18pm," Patients ask 60 per cent of GPs about medicinal cannabis There are calls for more general practitioners to become educated about medicinal cannabis and authorised to prescribe it, after a survey of 640 Australian GPs found almost two thirds have had patients ask about the drug. More than half the doctors said they supported the drug being available by prescription for use in cancer pain, palliative care and epilepsy, with their preferred 'access model' involving GPs prescribing independently of specialists. The survey was conducted by researchers from The Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics at the University of Sydney late last year and the results have been published in the British Medical Journal Open today. The survey found 61.5 per cent of GPs reported one or more patient had asked about medicinal cannabis in the three months before the questionnaire. ""This is a very live issue for GPs,"" Professor Iain McGregor from The Lambert Initiative told ABC News. ""58 per cent of the GPs we surveyed were in favour of the prescription of medicinal cannabis, so that's a clear majority of the GPs."" However the survey found most of the doctors felt their knowledge of the drug was inadequate and they were not comfortable discussing it with patients. Fewer than one in 10 knew how to navigate the bureaucracy involved with prescribing medicinal cannabis. Currently GPs wishing to prescribe it must either become an authorised prescriber for a class of patients, or apply for access per patient through the Therapeutic Goods Administration's (TGA) Special Access Scheme B (SAS-B). They also require approval from their state's health or poisons body and the support of a specialist. Professor McGregor said the process is onerous, complicated and time-consuming. ""It's really putting GPs in quite an uncomfortable position because no one has stepped up to train GPs about this issue properly,"" he said. ""The TGA has information on their website but I think some GPs look at that website, look at the application process, and just say 'I'm far too busy to deal with that'."" Dr Bastian Seidel from the Royal Australian College of GPs said the college was working with state and federal governments to develop a national framework that would allow GPs who want to prescribe medicinal cannabis to be able to do so. ""Medicinal cannabis prescribing is a basket case here in Australia and it's completely inappropriate — it should be much more straightforward, it should be streamlined as well,"" Dr Seidel said. ""If your GP feels it's appropriate for you to have medicinal cannabis and if it's appropriate for medicinal cannabis to be prescribed for your medical condition, then of course the GP should be authorised to prescribe that. ""I think it's a no-brainer."" However he added that the drug should only be considered as a last resort. ""I believe we need to be open-minded, we need to think of the opportunity medicinal cannabis offers, but we also need to be aware of the risk and benefits. ""We need to be very careful here because I recall very much that 20 years ago opioids were heavily promoted for the treatment of chronic pain and now we know they're actually doing more harm than good — we don't want to fall into the same trap when it comes to medicinal cannabis."" Last month Dr Vicki Kotsirilos became the first Australian GP authorised to prescribe medicinal cannabis after a rigorous application process before an ethics committee. She now has TGA authorisation to prescribe medicinal cannabis for patients with chronic and severe cancer pain or neuropathic pain, without the need for federal bureaucrats to approve each prescription. The Melbourne GP still needs the consent of a patient's specialist and approval from the state health department, but bypassing the TGA means the process takes hours, not days. ""So it's usually when a patient has tried everything and nothing else has helped them then I can now use medicinal cannabis as an option for treatment,"" Dr Kotsirilos told ABC News. ""These patients' quality of life has improved, they sleep better, they feel better, their moods improve, they have more energy because they sleep better, and they can think more clearly because they suffer less pain."" Dr Kotsirilos believes more GPs should learn about the drug and consider applying to become authorised prescribers. ""GPs need more training and education on at least learning what is the potential evidence, what is the science or lack of science, and what are the risks, benefits and side effects of using medicinal cannabis,"" she said. ""However one thing patients must realise is it's not the magic bullet — it is an alternative pain treatment, however it is not the magic bullet because it doesn't treat everybody and there can be some side effects from it."" Medicinal cannabis is not on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme so patients need to pay full price for products they are prescribed. The TGA's latest figures show that 193 patients had been treated by authorised prescribers, of which there are 33, and 673 patients had been given access under the SAS. There are many clinical trials underway but the number of participants is unknown.

19,WA home to one of the largest medicinal cannabis crops in the southern hemisphere,Tue 16 Feb 2021 at 10:47pm,"ABC Rural WA home to one of the largest medicinal cannabis crops in the southern hemisphere West Australia's remote Gascoyne region will soon be home to one of the largest medicinal cannabis facilities in the southern hemisphere, with the industry poised for budding success. Recently licensed medicinal cannabis company Elite Cannabinoids has received approval to cultivate and process a wide range of cannabis varieties at an undisclosed location more than 800 kilometres north of Perth. The crop itself will span over 46 hectares for cultivation, and there will be an onsite pharmaceutical manufacturing facility, as well as offices, and accommodation projected to create more than 60 jobs. Elite Cannabinoids chief executive Sebastian Cox said it was a huge win for the north-west region. ""It won't be as big as the Lake MacLeod salt operation, but once we are operating at full capacity, we will need 40 full-time staff that will do all sorts of tasks from corporate roles to growing, harvesting, extraction and formulation of medicines, logistics, and security,"" Mr Cox said. ""We also have the option to expand into more land as well so if everything goes well, we might be employing closer to 70 people in five years or so. ""It will be one of the biggest medicinal cannabis facilities in the southern hemisphere."" The Gascoyne region may be an arid landscape, but a combination of fertile soil and a subtropical climate has allowed the company to move away from hydroponics. Hydroponics is a common method for growing cannabis around the world. It is well suited to large-scale greenhouses and has proven success. Does medicinal cannabis work? Take a look at the evidence for different conditions. However, Mr Cox said with a natural source of light, the crop would be grown organically, reducing costs significantly. ""The Gascoyne has many drawcards,"" he said. ""It has some of the highest solar irradiation levels in the world, it is an isolated area — which is fantastic from a biosecurity standpoint because we don't want pesticide or insecticide drift from a neighbouring property. ""There is security of water and lots of expansion capability."" Mr Cox said a regenerative approach would be used at the facility. ""The whole aim is to increase nutrient cycling and carbon content within the soil,"" he said. ""If I can leave that piece of land in better condition than when we started, I think that's a good outcome."" The facility is expected to serve the need of patients across Australia, and has additional capacity to cater to export markets, with about 253,000 cannabis cultivars to be planted in the first phase of development. Mr Cox said he hoped to be in production by 2023. ""We have our local building approval already and, all things going to plan, we could start construction in six months,"" he said. ""The build-out phase itself could take 12 months, and another six months of commissioning and auditing. ""Realistically, I would hope the facility to be fully operational in two years."" There are currently 31 cannabis enterprises that have approval to operate in Australia, and although the sector is still in its early stages, experts anticipate the market to boom. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, about 600,000 Australians use cannabis for medical purposes. Senior analyst Will Chapman at IBIS World, an industry market research group, said there was huge potential for medicinal cannabis manufacturing in Australia. ""The government only legalised production and cultivation in 2016, so the industry is still in its youth phase,"" he said. ""A lot of companies are looking to establish operations and get the infrastructure set up so once some of the barriers to consumer access come down, they can capitalise on the opportunity. ""Our research suggests that over the next five years, medical cannabis manufacturing will grow to a $575-million industry. ""It's a significant opportunity because Australian producers also have access to export markets."" Christian Read insists while medical medicinal cannabis can't cure him of the pain he experiences, it grants him some relief. In 2019, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), the body responsible for regulating medicinal cannabis, granted more than 25,182 applications from doctors to prescribe the product. Last year, the TGA also gave the green light for low-dose cannabidiol to be available over the counter at pharmacies without prescription. However, Mr Chapman said there was still a lot of work to be done. ""There are currently no listed products on the register of the TGA that allow medicines to be supplied legally in Australia,"" he said. ""So patient access relies entirely on overcoming that regulatory barrier by demonstrating that they're safe, effective, consistent and formulated. ""Domestic production is still ramping up and rising demand for medical cannabis products in both domestic and export markets is anticipated to support strong growth this year. ""It will take time for new medical cannabis products to be approved, but medicines derived from cannabis will eventually appear on pharmacy shelves.""

20,Medicinal cannabis blacklisted by Australian pain specialists,"March 23, 2021 — 5.00am","We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 2 years ago Doctors are being told not to use medicinal cannabis to treat patients with chronic pain, warning there is no solid evidence it is effective, as Australia’s medical regulator approves its 100,000th cannabinoid script. Dean of ANZCA’s pain medicine faculty Professor Michael Vagg.Credit:Simon Schluter The recommendation from the country’s peak pain advisory body to doctors is: “Do not prescribe currently available cannabinoid products to treat chronic non-cancer pain unless part of a registered clinical trial.” The Faculty of Pain Medicine at the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA) says there is no robust evidence from gold-standard studies that proves cannabinoid products effectively treat these patients’ suffering. Cannabinoids are the active chemicals in cannabis. But the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is allowing doctors to apply for special access to prescribe medicinal cannabis products. Proponents argue the substances should be given the benefit of the doubt and offered to patients on compassionate grounds. Dean of ANZCA’s pain medicine faculty Professor Michael Vagg said medicinal cannabis products on the market “are not even close” to showing they are effective in the management of patients with complex chronic pain. “The research available is either unsupportive of using cannabinoid products in chronic non-cancer pain or is of such low quality that no valid scientific conclusion can be drawn,” the pain specialist and physician said. A medicinal cannabis farm at an undisclosed location in NSW that will legally produce large quantities of cannabis oil.Credit:Janie Barrett Cannabidiol-only formulations have never been the subject of any published randomised controlled trial (which are considered the scientific gold standard). “Substances like alcohol are more effective pound-for-pound but we don’t have extended opening hours at Dan Murphy’s for pain patients,” Professor Vagg said. ANZCA released its recommendation on Tuesday as part of the global Choosing Wisely awareness campaign, which highlights treatments, procedures and medications tests that have little or no evidence to support them. The recommendation has been backed by the International Association for the Study of Pain, the leading global authority on pain research, which released complimentary recommendations on Friday after a comprehensive review of relevant research. Roughly 190 different cannabis products are now available by prescription via the TGA’s special access application schemes. TGA boss Professor John Skerritt told attendees at the ACannabis ‘Evolve’ meeting - sponsored by the Medicinal Cannabis Industry Association - last week that the regulator had approved its 100,000th medicinal cannabis application in March. Roughly 64,000 patients have now been prescribed the substances by 2500 prescribers. The vast majority of those applications were for chronic pain such as arthritis, neck or back pain, fibromyalgia and migraines. Anxiety, insomnia and cancer symptoms accounted for just a fraction of medicinal cannabis prescriptions. Iain McGregor, Professor of Psychopharmacology and Academic director of the Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics at the University of Sydney agreed the evidence to back its efficacy was “very much under development”. “But this is a galloping horse heading off into the future with lots of patients already being prescribed medicinal cannabinoids and even more self-medicating,” Professor McGregor said. “One of the things [ANZCA] has to reconcile is why would all these people continue to use a product that doesn’t help them? “The TGA conducted its own review which concluded there is some evidence that it works but I agree, we need far more clinical trials in this space to give prescribers more confidence,” he said. Professor McGregor supported a “compassionate approach”. “Let’s give medicinal cannabis the benefit of the doubt while the hundreds of clinical trials around the world build the evidence base for their use,” he said. But Professor Vagg said the TGA’s analysis took a “very generous” view of the available evidence, while ANZCA’s recommendation was based on a more rigorous interrogation that considered the high risk of bias in some studies. “The TGA still found about four in 100 chronic pain patients could potentially benefit from medicinal cannabis but 20 to 25 patients would need to stop using it because of the side effects,” Professor Vagg said. ”It is such an amateur mistake to backfill this evidence gap now when this product is already being used. There should have been rigorous work to prove it’s effective and safe and then put it on the market [and continue to monitor its effectiveness,” he said. Chronic pain patients would be best served by multidisciplinary pain management clinics that teach them the skills to manage their pain, as well as physical reconditioning, assessing their biomechanics, occupational therapy and procedures or medicinal treatments with evidence to back their effectiveness, Professor Vagg said. The Medicinal Cannabis Industry Association said while the industry has only be able to legally conduct clinical trials in Australia since 2016, a body of evidence was emerging globally that supported the use of medicinal cannabis. The industry group supported the formation of an independent advisory council to inform patients and ensure access to education and training for prescribers. “[The association] believes that through a focus on balanced and evidence-based information, along with the industry adhering to high standards, there will be increased confidence in medicinal cannabis by patients, the medical/healthcare sector and community,” it said in a statement.

21,"Morning mail: medicinal cannabis boom, Brazil’s Bolsonaro on the brink, Indonesian stadium disaster",,"Monday: Some patients are taking cannabis for medical conditions when there is little evidence it’s effective, experts say. Plus: why a scream might be good for you Good morning. There’s a boom in prescriptions for medicinal cannabis in Australia, which has some people worried. Conservatives are celebrating the rout of “lefties” from the Liberal party in this year’s election loss. And polls suggest Brazil’s former leftwing president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is poised to defeat his far-right rival Jair Bolsonaro. Australia’s Conservative Political Action Conference wrapped up yesterday with many guests criticising the approach of the Liberal party in the previous government. The party’s federal vice-president said the “good thing about the last federal election is a lot of those lefties are gone”, referring to defeated Liberal candidates. Prescriptions for unapproved medicinal cannabis have quadrupled since 2019. But researchers and GP groups worry that patients are taking cannabis for conditions where there is little evidence it is effective. Most prescriptions are for unapproved products, which means the Therapeutic Goods Administrations did not authorise that treatment. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is on the brink of an astonishing political comeback, with polls suggesting he is poised to defeat Jair Bolsonaro. Eve-of-election polls suggested Lula was within a whisker of securing the overall majority of votes that would guarantee him a first-round victory against Brazil’s radical incumbent. But Bolsonaro has refused to confirm he will respect the announced result if it goes against him. A former ADF Special Operations intelligence analyst who is now an expert on countering violent extremism says Australian children brought out of Syrian refugee camps will require intensive support to successfully integrate into the community. “It’s a long, intensive and individualised process but, done holistically, will have excellent results,” Shane Healey said. Support for the stage three tax cuts remains low with the majority of Australians backing sound economic management over sticking to election promises, a survey suggests. The research from the Australia Institute found that high-income earners were particularly likely to support the repeal of the planned and legislated tax relief, despite being the main beneficiaries of the changes. One of the world’s worst sports stadium disasters has left 125 people dead and about 180 injured at a football match in Indonesia. Police used teargas in response to a pitch invasion by rioting fans, causing a crush among panicked spectators. Officers and organisers are facing scrutiny over the tragedy, one of the world’s deadliest sports stadium disasters, including questions over the use of teargas inside the venue, which is contrary to Fifa guidance.

Screaming is considered to have huge benefits in Chinese medicine. Yet women are always being told to control their emotions, given the message that screaming is “ugly” and that no one will listen to them if they show their emotions. But the behavioural scientist Pragya Agarwal testifies that there’s nothing like a good scream. It is becoming increasingly clear that the mind/brain and body are intimately linked, and that the body influences our thoughts and emotions. Being conscious does not just mean having awareness of the outside world. It means being aware of one’s self within one’s surroundings. The way we experience our body is central to how we perceive our self. Squat, prone to mischief and occasionally bitey, the corgi is not for everyone.

22,"WA parliamentary committee pushes for medicinal cannabis, drug driving reforms",Thu 30 Mar 2023 at 7:34am," WA parliamentary committee pushes for medicinal cannabis, drug driving reforms A West Australian parliamentary report has recommended the elimination of barriers to accessing medicinal cannabis, including letting people with a prescription drive a car while the drug is in their system. The Select Committee on Cannabis and Hemp has made 16 recommendations to the state government, ranging from changing drug driving laws to doubling the amount doctors are allowed to prescribe to patients. Legalise Cannabis Party member and committee chair Brain Walker said change was overdue and that WA Premier Mark McGowan should take action. ""What I'd like to say to to the premier and to the state government is that we have an option for enhancing the wellness of the population of the state,"" he said. ""There's a significant proportion who will benefit from cannabis and who are not currently able to enjoy the benefits of that medication. ""Examine this and please commence the process to making legislative change."" The ABC has contacted Mr McGowan's office for comment. Dr Walker said the ACT had decriminalised all drugs and noted that there was a medical defence for drug driving in Tasmania. He said Victoria was likely to ""follow suit"" with a law permitting motorists to drive with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in their system, provided they were not impaired. ""If WA put all our recommendations into law then we would probably be the most sensible and advanced state in Australia,"" he said. Medicinal cannabis prescriptions more than doubled in Australia in the last 12 months. So what's behind the skyrocketing demand — and how good is the evidence for its use? Dr Walker said the report represented an opportunity to address decades of stigma. ""The reason that cannabis was banned in the first place is absolutely unfactual,"" he said. ""It was banned because of propaganda and politics — [not because of a] single medicinal fact. ""The report goes a long way to showing that this is actually safe, it's sensible. ""It is in fact a healthy, healing herb which can do wonderful things for wellness."" The McGowan government has two months to formally respond to the report's findings. The report outlined the main barriers to accessing medicinal cannabis as doctors having too much paperwork to do, a reluctance to prescribe, the cost of the drug, outdated driving laws, and workplace drug-testing regimes. It said criminal sanctions for those caught driving with THC caused harm because it encouraged doctor hesitancy and restricted the movements of those using medicinal cannabis. ""The mere presence of THC in a person’s bodily fluid has no correlation to their current level of impairment,"" the report stated. ""Patients accessing medicinal cannabis usually use it as a final option for serious health conditions. ""[They] are more reliant upon car travel than the general population and face significant disadvantages from not having access to transport."" The report pointed to existing exemptions for other prescribed drugs, such as sedatives and opioids. Dr Walker said driving laws were the main barrier he identified for medicinal cannabis users and urged immediate change. ""It's plain wrong — if your job depends upon you being able to drive and you've got a chronic pain, you can't take the THC because you could possibly lose your job,"" he said. ""So people make the decision, 'Do I live in pain? Or do I work?'"" The report recommended removing the requirement for doctors to get ""authorisation"" to prescribe the drug. It also recommended raising the daily prescribing limit from 40 milligrams to at least 100mg, on the basis that ""the current limit poses an unnecessary restraint to access of medicinal cannabis"". A ""compassionate access scheme"" was also recommended due to the cost of the drug. The select committee also heard that ""zero-tolerance"" workplace testing for THC created a barrier to access and also punished workers who had legitimately sourced the drug. Co-founder Simone O'Brien says the organisation is needed to provide medicinal cannabis education, advocacy and peer support for nurses. It heard many mining companies did not distinguish between medicinal cannabis and recreational use. Business groups raised concerns with the committee that the drug could compromise worker safety on mine sites. The report said anyone impaired should not engage in work, but recommended the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety provide information to companies on how THC does and does not affect impairment. It said medicinal cannabis should be treated in the same manner as other potentially impairing prescription drugs. Dunsborough GP Matty Moore has been an authorised prescriber of medicinal cannabis for years and says he sees ""several patients a week"" worried about having cannabis in their system at the workplace. ""The no tolerance is just not fair, because they can be using their medicine as prescribed, and we know that THC doesn't impair beyond five hours, but still the policies are, if they find it in your bloodstream, if they find it in your urine, you potentially lose your job,"" he said. ""[Mining companies are] using the old drug and alcohol screens randomly and even patients that use very little THC, appropriately and as prescribed, are getting their jobs taken out from under them. ""I'd say a few patients a week are not able to use THC [because of this].""

23,Medicinal cannabis research gets $33m from grandparents of girl with epilepsy,,"Donation from Barry and Joy Lambert made ‘not only for benefit of those with childhood epilepsy, like our Katelyn, but for wide range of other conditions’ The grandparents of three-year-old girl with a rare form of epilepsy have made a $33.7m donation to the University of Sydney to fund medicinal cannabis research. Announcing their donation at the university on Friday, Barry and Joy Lambert said international research suggested their granddaughter Katelyn, who suffers hundreds of seizures each day, may benefit from medicinal cannabis treatment. A meeting with researchers at the university to discuss Katelyn’s condition, known as Dravet syndrome, led her family to believe that more detailed research needed to be carried out, Barry Lambert said. “Not only for the possible benefit of children with childhood epilepsy, like our Katelyn, but also for its potential benefits for a wide range of other conditions that may benefit from extensive research into the cannabis plant,” he said. “The experience of our granddaughter … has opened our eyes to the extraordinary possibility of cannabinoids treating not only her condition but a range of chronic illnesses that don’t often respond to conventional treatments.” Dravet syndrome begins in childhood and places sufferers at a higher risk of sudden death. Treatment options are poor and many with the condition suffer difficulties with speech, delayed growth, movement and balance. The syndrome is not as responsive as other types of epilepsy to conventional treatments. A US-led study published in April that examined 75 child epilepsy sufferers found that of those with Dravet syndrome, 23% responded to treatment with oral cannabis extracts. The authors concluded there was a need for larger and more rigorous studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the treatment for paediatric epilepsies, but found it was well tolerated in their sample. The donation will go towards the university’s “Lambert initiative” for clinical and scientific cannabinoid-related research, in the hope of ultimately producing cannabinoid-based medicines. In December, the New South Wales government announced that it would sponsor clinical trials for the substance, and in March, Queensland and Victoria said they would hold similar trials. The NSW premier, Mike Baird, said the donation from the Lamberts would give that state a reputation for being at the forefront of research in the field. “NSW is breaking new ground in terms of medical cannabis research and this major investment confirms our state’s leadership in this area,” Baird said. “The Lamberts’ investment gives our cause enormous momentum, and my hope is it dramatically increases the cross-sector knowledge sharing required to ultimately produce cannabinoid-based medicines that are safe, reliable and affordable.” A priority of the Lambert initiative will be to examine how cannabidiol, a non-intoxicating compound in cannabis, works to treat paediatric epilepsy, and to explore whether other compounds identified as having the most potential can treat the condition. The Lamberts’ donation is one of the largest made by the public to medical research. In August, Queensland property developer Clive Berghofer donated $50.1m to the Queensland Institute of Medical Research, the largest single philanthropic donation from an Australian.",11,508
24,"Medicinal cannabis driving inquiry hears measuring impairment is key, as NSW law change considered",Thu 16 Jun 2022 at 8:24am," Medicinal cannabis driving inquiry hears measuring impairment is key, as NSW law change considered Can you stand on one leg with your eyes closed? That was one of the tests suggested to a New South Wales parliamentary inquiry in Sydney as a way of deciding if a motorist was fit to drive after using medicinal cannabis. The inquiry heard from a range of experts about a Greens bill designed to protect medical cannabis patients in NSW from drug-driving charges. Determining impairment has emerged as a key issue in the debate. Current NSW laws, introduced in 2007, mean a motorist can be charged if any trace of the psychoactive component of cannabis (THC) is detected in their system. This can happen after a blood test or a roadside saliva test. The federal government legalised the use of medicinal cannabis in 2016, but the NSW law remains the same. Doctor Joel Wren, from the Society of Cannabis Clinicians, today told the inquiry the current laws were ""archaic"" and ""nothing short of discrimination"". He said the driving laws surrounding medicinal cannabis should be consistent with other prescription therapies such as opioids. ""We are widely prescribing these medications every single day to many Australians and we are telling them it is okay to wait a while if you feel impaired, that some people do metabolise these medications differently,"" Dr Wren said. ""With medicinal cannabis it's just a flat-out refusal, absolutely not, it doesn't matter about impairment.""  But the Standing Committee on Law and Justice was told determining a cannabis user's level of impairment could be tricky. Doctor Danielle McCartney, from the University of Sydney's Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapies, told the inquiry she had done extensive work in the field using driving simulators and computerised cognitive-function tests. ""Obviously not all of that is practical at the roadside,"" she said. ""There are of course the field sobriety tests, which are used internationally in order to identify people who are not safe to drive."" The Lambert Initiative's Professor Iain McGregor said the traditional test of getting a motorist to walk in a straight line did not work well for cannabis users. ""Cannabis people seem to be able to walk the straight line quite well,"" he said. ""But if you ask them to stand on one leg and close their eyes and remain upright, that seems to be quite challenging."" Doctor Thomas Arkell, from Swinburne University, told the inquiry he had some reservations about the test. ""Some people find that very hard anyway,"" he said. ""Particularly in older people, when your balance tends to get worse, especially if you have hip or keen problems.""  The inquiry has heard 180,000 applications for medicinal cannabis use had been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration as of October 12, 2021. The number of active patients in Australia in September last year was estimated at 70,000. A submission to the inquiry from the NSW Government suggested the presence of THC in a driver's system increased their crash risk by 50 per cent. Professor Lambert disputed that figure, but conceded the data was complex. ""What they call the odds ratio is about 1.1 to 1.4 if you are acutely intoxicated with cannabis,"" he said. ""In other words it's an increased crash risk of 10 to 40 per cent. ""That is about the same as 0.04 or 0.05 blood-alcohol concentration, and is significantly less than you would see with opioids or benzodiazapines or sedating anti-depressant drugs that are very widely prescribed. ""You're actually improving road safety if you get someone off an opioid, which is more impairing than medicinal cannabis, or get them off valium which is also more impairing than cannabis."" But the inquiry was told the NSW Government had no intention of changing the law. The state's head of Transport Safety, Peter Dunphy, said between 2016 and 2020 there were 253 fatal crashes involving drivers and riders with THC in their system. ""This represents about 16 per cent of all fatal crashes and approximates to one fatal crash every week,"" he said. ""THC can affect the cognitive and motor skills necessary for safe driving. ""While it is true that much of the evidence for impairment impacts are from illicit THC use, there is still evidence that medicinal THC users can be impaired for a period of time. Mr Dunphy said cannabis was different from other drugs, because there was no way to distinguish between medicinal and recreational use. ""Until there is clear evidence on the effects of medicinal cannabis on driving, the NSW Government will continue to take a cautious approach,"" he said. Greens MLC Cate Faehrmann challenged the validity of statistics quoted in the government's submission, suggesting the fact THC was present in a driver's system did not necessarily make it a factor in a fatal crash. The committee will present a report to parliament in early August.

25,Mysterious pink glow in sky over Australian town revealed to be from local cannabis facility ,,"‘Bizarre’ pink lights seen in the sky above Victorian town of Mildura were not an alien invasion after all An alien invasion? Season five of Stranger Things? A portal to the timespace continuum? Residents in the northern Victorian town of Mildura were left pleasantly dumbfounded on Wednesday evening when the night sky was set ablaze with an eerie pink glow. “It was very bizarre,” said Tammy Szumowski. “I was on the phone to my mum, and my dad was saying the world was ending.” But the explanation was far more mundane. Pharmaceutical company Cann Group confirmed the lights were coming from its local medicinal cannabis facility, where the blackout blinds had been left open. “Cannabis plants require different spectrums of light in order to encourage their growth,” said Rhys Cohen, senior communications manager at Cann Group Ltd. “A red spectrum light is often used. Normally the facility would have blackout blinds that come down at night, and will in the future block that glow.” The federal member for Mallee, Dr Anne Webster, was driving home in the dark when she noticed the smouldering pink light. “I thought that is weird. There is no city out there … What is it?” she said. “When I understood the Cann processing site is there – but it still was the first time I’ve seen that pink glow. It was quite strange.” Cann Group Ltd was the first Australian company to secure licences for cannabis cultivation for medicinal and research purposes. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On 7 July, its Mildura facility received its GMP licence to cultivate and supply a wide range of medicinal cannabis products in-house after acquiring the site in 2019. It gathered its first commercial harvest of crops in June. Webster said it was “quite an exciting site”. Due to the nature of its business, however, it has a secret location and isn’t open to the public. “Propagation of cannabis is really interesting and the way they use lights … to increase the growth cycle and speed up the whole process is quite amazing,” she said. “I look forward to many other innovative producers coming to the region and bringing their glows with them.” Across Mildura and surrounding towns, people flocked to their backyards and front porches to photograph the spectral glow. Alexandra Talent’s husband was feeding the horses when he noticed they were “a little distracted” on Wednesday evening. “The kids’ imaginations went wild and of course the topic of aliens was presented. “My husband and I were a bit more optimistic.” Red Cliffs resident Andrew Kynaston was on the way home from getting his Covid booster with his wife at about 6.30pm when they spotted the lights. “It looked pretty and strange,” he said. Kynaston is used to looking at sunsets but he said he’d never seen a view quite like it. “I pinched my wife’s phone and took a couple of pictures,” he said. “It was around 6.30 when I saw it and thought maybe it was some kind of deflection at first. “It wasn’t until I saw the comments later that I understood what it was.”",15,530
26,Medicinal cannabis company to build one of the world's largest production facilities in regional Victoria,Thu 22 Aug 2019 at 5:11am," Medicinal cannabis company to build one of the world's largest production facilities in regional Victoria A regional Victorian town will soon house one of the world's largest medicinal cannabis production facilities, amid a push to drive patients away from the thriving black market. Australian company Cannatrek has been given the final green light to develop the $160 million plant near Shepparton. There are plans to produce 160 tonnes of medicinal cannabis each year and create 400 jobs in the process. Cannatrek chief executive Tommy Huppert said Shepparton was one of the first locations in Australia to tap into the growing market.  ""We believe that the region will become a major centre for the production of medicinal cannabis,"" he said. The facility — which will operate out of a glasshouse similar to tomato or herbal greenhouses — was approved by the Greater Shepparton City Council this week, after earlier securing Federal Government approvals. Construction will begin soon and it could be fully operational in 2020. Mr Huppert said Shepparton was selected because of its ""abundant water, long hours of sunlight and passionate people"" with significant skills in agri-technology. The company purchased 178 acres of land about a year ago and worked on obtaining planning permits from the local council. ""We will be a major employer and there will be significant and positive knock-on effects in the region,"" Mr Huppert said.  ""We are now preparing the development to build a scalable project and we have received planning permission for the entire project."" He said a wide range of skills would be needed to operate the facility, including researchers and agronomists. ""The facility is over 160,000 square metres, so that's a lot of people to be employed to run the site. ""Researchers are essential to breeding the correct species which will adapt in the environment — once the plants are put into the grow rooms, there's constant taking care of the plant during its lifetime, which is 10 to 12 weeks. ""Then there's the post activity, which is another skill."" The Greater Shepparton City Council has welcomed Cannatrek's investment in the region. ""We would like to thank the State Government for their support of our region and encourage other investors to talk to us about opportunities for growth and investment in Greater Shepparton,"" Mayor Kim O'Keeffee said. According to the Victorian Government, medicinal cannabis can cost a patient up to $1,000 a week or $52,000 a year depending on the nature of the condition. John Teh, a GP and medical director of  PlantMed — a clinic which specialises in cannabinoid medicine — said the high cost often led patients to the illegal market. He hoped more onshore production would reduce both the cost, and the number of people sourcing it illegally. ""At the moment the majority of people will be accessing it illegally because of where the availability and affordability of medicines is at."" Cannatrek estimated about 500,000 Australians bought cannabis on the black market each year to self-medicate. The company's Mr Huppert hoped the facility would contribute to reducing patient risk. ""This is really about ... creating a clean product which is a therapeutic product of choice. ""The problem with the black market is that no-one knows how it's grown or what chemicals are used."" The company said the number of prescriptions for medicinal cannabis has steadily increased, with authorities granting approximately 11,500 approvals under the Therapeutic Goods Administration's (TGA) Special Access Scheme — and almost 10,500 were approved in the last year. However Dr Teh said patients actually accessing the medicine could be a problem. ""Because this has only started up in the last few years and there's not many doctors who have the knowledge or time to prescribe it effectively, there's a bottleneck in that area."" In order to prescribe medicinal cannabis, a doctor needs to apply to the TGA for approval for a script of an individual patient's supply, or apply to become an authorised prescriber. There are 54 authorised prescribers, such as GPs and oncologists, in Australia. The medicine can be prescribed to relieve sufferers of chronic pain, epilepsy, inflammation, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and anorexia. The director of the Australian Centre for Cannabinoid Clinical and Research Excellence, Professor Jennifer Martin, has previously told the ABC that scientific evidence for medicinal cannabis was mixed. She said the evidence of benefits was strongest when treating conditions such as epilepsy in children who had not responded to other medication. ""The evidence of non-cancer pain is actually not that strong,"" she said. ""Certainly some people that have taken cannabinoids do say they have had a lot of benefit, but we have also seen older patients who have side effects.""

27,"Tasmanian GPs will soon be able to prescribe medicinal cannabis, but fast access is still a while away",Wed 17 Mar 2021 at 9:57pm," Tasmanian GPs will soon be able to prescribe medicinal cannabis, but fast access is still a while away Tasmanians will soon be able to visit their general practitioner and request a prescription for medicinal cannabis — but while the State Government says that option will be available from July 1, it might not be quite that simple. Tasmania is the only jurisdiction in Australia where GPs can not prescribe medicinal cannabis to patients. Patients can only get legal access to the drug through a medical specialist, like a neurologist. From September 2017 to August 2020, only 16 Tasmanians were legally prescribed medicinal cannabis through the state's Controlled Access Scheme. Medicinal cannabis advocates and politicians, including Tasmanian MLC Ivan Dean and Tasmanian Labor senators Anne Urquhart and Catryna Bilyk have long called for Tasmania's scheme to be improved. A Senate Inquiry tasked with investigating the ""current barriers to patient access to medicinal cannabis in Australia"" also recommended early last year that the state fall in line with other jurisdictions. On Monday, the Tasmanian Government announced in its State of the State address it would do that. From July 1, Tasmanian GPs will be able to seek permission through the Therapeutic Goods Administration to prescribe medicinal cannabis to patients. Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein uses his State of the State address to announce a raft of new funding for mental health, housing, training and construction in response to a COVID-19 recovery report. GPs will need to apply for each patient individually through the national streamlined online application pathway and they will receive authorisation as to whether they can prescribe within 48 hours. Patients who are successfully prescribed medicinal cannabis through a GP will then get their script filled at private pharmacies. Currently, all prescribed medicinal cannabis through the Controlled Access Scheme is dispensed at Tasmanian Health Service pharmacies in hospitals and is given out a heavily subsidised rate by the State Government. Specialists will still be able to prescribe under the changes and it is understood patients who get scripts that way will still get medication at a subsidised rate. Northern Tasmanian mother Lyn Cleaver has been trying to get her son Jeremy on the Controlled Access Scheme since it started in 2017. She said cannabis helped him with his epilepsy. Ms Cleaver said the changes were ""desperately needed"" so people didn't have to turn to the illegal market. ""The scheme as it stands at the moment is effectively pushing people to the alternative market,"" Ms Cleaver said. ""Getting in to see a specialist takes a long time, up to 12 months sometimes, so it will be good if patients can speak to their GPs and I assume many patients will be looking to utilise this new scheme,"" she said. ""But the issue remains around availability and affordability."" Ms Cleaver said supply of medicinal cannabis interstate was not consistent and she had heard of many Australians left waiting for product due to supply shortages. She said some bottles of prescription medicinal cannabis were costing Australians $300 and medicine would sometimes last less than a week. She said her family was still considering whether they would seek a prescription for Jeremy through a doctor. ""I'm not sure whether we could afford to do it for Jeremy,"" she said. ""Patients a lot of the time are on a disability support pension, so there's not a lot of money to spare to start with, so that's going to be an issue."" Dr Tim Jackson, who is the chairman of the Tasmanian branch of The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, said while there's ""no doubt"" some doctors will want to prescribe medicinal cannabis, many would need more education first. ""It's confusing at the moment, there's no direct clinical guidelines, so I think that's why most GPs would be a bit cautious about prescribing something like this until there's a bit more information,"" Dr Jackson said. ""The problem from a general practice point of view is we're not entirely sure about the safety and the efficacy of medicinal cannabis, although there is more information becoming available,"" he said. ""I wouldn't expect any GPs to be able to prescribe medicinal cannabis in the short term, so I'd encourage patients not to have the expectation that you can now go to your GP and get medicinal cannabis ... it's probably going to take, in reality, six to nine months, even 12 months probably."" He said trying to educate GPs about medicinal cannabis at the same time they learnt about the coronavirus vaccine would also be difficult. ""At the end of day whatever happens, it needs to be done systematically and safely,"" Dr Jackson said. Pharmacy Guild of Australia Tasmania branch president Helen O'Byrne said the scheme change was welcome news, but agreed there was still work to do first. She said there were currently a limited range of medicinal cannabis products in Australia that had been approved for sale by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. ""It means that the doctor and the pharmacy will need to apply to import that product specifically for the patient and get special permission from the government,"" Ms O'Byrne said. ""There's lots of paper work involved and it's quiet an expensive process for the patient, but it does mean if all those boxes get ticked, that people will be able to access medicinal cannabis."" Ms O'Byrne said there was still consultation that needed to happen between the Tasmanian Government, pharmacists and GPs before the changes to the scheme changes were implemented. Ms Cleaver said in the near future the State Government also needed to consider how people using prescribed medicinal cannabis could use a motor vehicle. ""At the moment, if you have THC in your system you can't drive, so that will need to be looked at,"" Ms Cleaver said. She said the Tasmanian Government also needed to look at better legal protections for people who had no choice but to grow their own medicinal cannabis. The senate committee investigating the barriers to medicinal cannabis access last year recommended amnesties for the possession and/or cultivation of cannabis for genuine self-medication purposes be looked at. It also recommended drug driving laws and their implications for patients with legal medicinal cannabis prescriptions be reviewed.

28,"Australian Cannabis Nurses Association launches to educate, advocate for medicinal cannabis",Mon 20 Feb 2023 at 8:24pm," Australian Cannabis Nurses Association launches to educate, advocate for medicinal cannabis A newly formed group with a vision to offer medicinal cannabis education, advocacy and peer support to nurses has launched this week. Nurse practitioner and medicinal cannabis prescriber, Simone O'Brien, will lead the Australian Cannabis Nurses Association (ACNA) alongside co-founders Deb Ranson and Jodie Davis. ""There's misinformation about cannabis with clinicians,"" Ms O'Brien said. ""We are very keen to decrease the stigma."" The group wants education about the endocannabinoid system included in undergraduate nursing degrees. This week marks seven years since the Federal Parliament passed legislation to legalise medicinal cannabis in Australia. Most cannabis medications are classified as unapproved therapies, which means permission is required from the Commonwealth Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) before a prescription is issued. Since 2016, the number of prescriptions has skyrocketed from just a handful to well over 100,000 last year. Ms O'Brien first became interested in medicinal cannabis after an accident in 2019 left her with a ""really nasty break"" in her leg. During months off work and in rehab, she looked into whether medicinal cannabis could work for her. ""It was just amazing for my pain,"" Ms O'Brien said. ""I thought I'm going to start prescribing it as well because it's a really valid option for people who have chronic pain."" Ms O'Brien said the ACNA would offer medicinal cannabis training for nurses at all levels. They will also offer peer support for nurses and advocate for better patient access. ""A lot of patients will go and speak to their health providers, whether that's a GP, a psychologist, psychiatrists, and they say, 'No, cannabis won't suit you',"" she said. ""We want to get the word out that this is a very safe medicine and it's applicable across a whole lot of different patient populations."" What's behind the skyrocketing demand for medicinal cannabis — and how good is the evidence for its use? The ABC contacted the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) and the Australian Medical Association (AMA) for comment. None were able to respond before deadline. The AMA has consistently advocated for caution regarding medicinal cannabis. ""Though there is a growing body of evidence regarding the therapeutic use of cannabinoids, it is still experimental,"" the AMA position statement said. The statement calls for clinical trials to be conducted and said where medicinal cannabis is ""deemed safe and effective"" it should only be made available after existing treatments have failed. The RACGP also highlighted the need for ""further high-quality research into the safety and effectiveness of medicinal cannabis products, as the current evidence is limited and inconclusive"". ""The current available evidence does, however, suggest a possible role for medicinal cannabis products in a number of areas,"" the RACGP statement said. ""Therefore, if after conventional, evidence-based treatments have failed, and the specialist general practitioner (GP) feels that medicinal cannabis products are a viable treatment option for their patients, they should … be able to prescribe appropriate medicinal cannabis products."" Co-founding director of United In Compassion and the Australian Medicinal Cannabis Association (AMCA), Lucy Haslam, said the formation of the ACNA was ""exciting"". Mrs Haslam said the lack of awareness around medicinal cannabis often saw patients discriminated against. ""There are patients losing their work because of outdated drug testing,"" Mrs Haslam said. ""Sometimes patients go into facilities, like hospitals, respite care centres, or aged care centres, and they are not able to access a legally prescribed and legally supplied product because the staff don't have the awareness that they probably should."" The association's launch will form part of the inaugural Medicinal Cannabis Awareness Week, run by AMCA. Mrs Haslam first started campaigning to legalise medicinal cannabis in 2014 with her son Dan, who relied on the drug after he was diagnosed with terminal bowel cancer. February 24 marks eight years since Dan's death, and seven years since medicinal cannabis was legalised in Australia. Mrs Haslam said many patients still struggle to find reliable information about the medication. ""We want to help patients understand that it is now legal, that there are legal pathways,"" she said. While this year Medicinal Cannabis Awareness Week will be a community-run event, AMCA hopes the Federal Parliament will formally recognise it in the future. ""Then it will be an enduring week where we can sort of focus on some of the issues and continue to make things better for patients,"" Mrs Haslam said.

29,"Queensland's medicinal cannabis advocates plea for compassion, access to drug",Mon 9 Jan 2017 at 9:16am," Queensland's medicinal cannabis advocates plea for compassion, access to drug Medicinal cannabis advocates are pleading for compassion and urging Australian authorities to legalise the drug to help ease the pain and suffering of those who desperately need it. It follows the South Australian police raid on Adelaide supplier Jenny Hallam's property last week that sparked an outcry from families who rely on her for the supply of cannabis oil. In Queensland, doctors will be able to prescribe medicinal cannabis for patients in March after laws were passed by State Parliament last October. But advocates believe the three-month wait could cost people their lives.  Queensland advocate Rebecca Bridson said she was willing to be arrested and would continue to flout the law by helping to source the illegal drug for the sick and terminally ill. ""They can arrest me and they can charge me,"" she said. ""That's part and parcel of the risk we take, but what harm am I doing. Where's my victim?"" Bribie Island mother Katrina Spraggon said her eight-year-old daughter suffered life-threatening epilepsy and would die without the drug which had dramatically reduced the number and severity of her seizures. ""Please give us amnesty, not just for me but for millions of people,"" she said. ""There's that many cannabis community patients and they're too scared to come forward in case they get prosecuted. ""It's a joke. If everyone came forward and actually said what they're on, this would be legalised. I'm over it."" The parents of a 14-year-old girl with an inoperable brain cancer are also applauding the benefits of medicinal cannabis oil. Linda Bonaccorsi says regular MRI's are evidence her daughter's tumour has changed dramatically from a hard lump to a jelly-like substance since using the drug. ""A few months ago she was not walking, she couldn't feed herself,"" she said. ""She could do nothing but look at her now, she's so strong and the oil is 100 per cent I reckon. ""The only side-effect Becky gets is sometimes she gets tired."" Ms Bonaccorsi said she was not comfortable with breaking the law by using the illegal drug, but nothing else was working. ""I don't have a choice, it scares me that I have to do this."" The families say they are not criminals and medicinal cannabis is saving and prolonging people's lives.

30,Elderly people breaking the law to use medicinal cannabis for the aches and pains of ageing,Fri 8 Mar 2019 at 8:00pm," Elderly people breaking the law to use medicinal cannabis for the aches and pains of ageing Sixty-five-year-old Julie has never smoked a joint in her life but has started treating herself with medicinal cannabis for pain. ""I did have cancer and as a result I have neuropathy [nerve pain] in my feet, and arthritis in my fingers, and since I've been using medicinal cannabis that is starting to improve,"" Julie said, who did not want to use her real name. ""The big one though is I have sports injuries — spinal and ligament wear and tear — and now my pain is 95 per cent healed."" Julie has been taking two drops a night of a cannabinoid oil and a paste with a low tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) dose under her tongue in the morning. She is one of a growing number of senior Australians who are buying homemade medicinal cannabis products for pain relief, despite it being early days in scientific research to support the drug's effectiveness. While there is a legal process for using medicinal cannabis, it can only be prescribed by a medical practitioner and this is done on a case-by-case basis. General practitioners can apply to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for approval for a script for individual patients or can become authorised prescribers. To date the TGA has approved applications for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, paediatric epilepsy, cancer pain, anorexia, and in some cases of palliative care. Although research projects are underway in Australia and internationally, to date there has been mixed evidence that medicinal cannabis is effective for pain relief. One of the reasons for the intense interest to find out more is that we know our own bodies make cannabinoids — chemical messengers that are important to our physiology. Perminder Sachdev, a neurophysicist and co-director of the Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing (CHeBA) at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, said humans had receptors for cannabis in the body: CB1 and CB2 receptors. ""The CB1 receptor is present in the hippocampus and in other regions of the brain, and the hippocampus is quite important for memory,"" Scientia Professor Sachdev said. The CB2 receptor is present on white blood cells, which are important for managing inflammation and immunity. ""We know that the activation of these receptors does lead to the reduction of some chemicals in the brain, and there is a reduction of inflammation in the brain,"" Scientia Professor Sachdev said. ""So, people have wondered what role these receptors, or any drugs that act on these receptors, could be playing in relation to brain function."" Medicinal cannabis pilot studies include research on pain relief, managing behaviour problems in dementia patients, relief for people with Crohn's Disease and animal studies to see if cannabis can prevent Alzheimer's Disease. A year ago, 70-year-old pensioner Paula Vam Vas had a fall, tore the meniscus cartilage in her right knee, and was placed on a public hospital waiting list for surgery. ""It was really painful and the option my doctor gave was [Panadeine] Forte and other opiates for the pain and for sleeping,"" Ms Vam Vas said. ""I didn't want to take them, but the pain was quite severe."" A long-term advocate for decriminalising marijuana, Ms Vam Vas decided to try a cannabinoid oil that had small amounts of THC, the psychoactive ingredient of cannabis. ""So, it doesn't get you stoned,"" Ms Vam Vas said. She was adamant the relief she felt was genuine and not due to a placebo effect. ""Until I took it, I wasn't convinced that it was going to work … it [her knee] hurt so bad,"" Ms Vam Vas said. ""But it put me to sleep, while I was asleep the pain stopped, and during the day I took it at different times when I could feel the pain coming on and it gave me really good relief."" Working through a legal process to access medicinal cannabis was not an option for Ms Vam Vas. ""My doctor doesn't want to know about it and the doctors that can prescribe it are few and far between, and it's very expensive,"" she said. ""What I would pay $90 a month for, would be around $200."" Recently Ms Vam Vas stopped treating herself with medicinal cannabis. This was, she said, because a friend using it to ease the effects of chemotherapy was pulled over by the police and charged with driving with illicit drugs present. ""The interesting thing about it is you're not charged with driving under the influence of a drug, you are charged with having an illegal drug in your system, it doesn't matter to what degree,"" Ms Vam Vas said. Ms Vam Vas has tried to manage her pain without the use of drugs, but said when it became unbearable, she took the Panadeine Forte that her doctor prescribed. ""He's happy to give it to me because he knows I'm in pain,"" Ms Vam Vas said. ""It certainly knocks me out, it's terrific like that, but if I had been taking it all year I wonder what effect it would have on my kidneys, my liver, my bowel and my stomach."" Leah Bisiani, a registered nurse who specialises in the care of elderly people in nursing homes, has become an advocate for more research into medicinal cannabis products as an alternative pain relief treatment for patients in aged care. ""It is a huge area that has been ineffectively managed for a long time,"" Ms Bisiani said. Residents of aged care facilities were prone to muscular skeletal pain, neuropathic pain, and pain associated with cancer and palliative conditions. ""The majority of our aged care population are on opiate regimes with numerous amounts of additional medication to counter the side effects of the opiates they are on,"" Ms Bisiani said. ""There are the obvious ones like constipation because of codeine, but there are also sedation effects where people become delirious. ""It can cause increased confusion, anxiety and agitation, nausea and it places them at a higher risk of falling."" Ms Bisiani said she believed medicinal cannabis had fewer side effects and that anecdotal evidence suggested it was a viable alternative to opiates for pain relief. ""Just like you do with any medication, you need to monitor it effectively, we can change the dosage, so we can meet the individual needs. ""The safeguards already in place for opiate regimes could apply to medicinal cannabis regimes."" As of January 31, 2019 only 54 doctors across Australia were registered as approved prescribers of medicinal cannabis. The TGA said because of the small numbers it could not provide information on how many of these doctors practised in regional Australia. A TGA spokesperson said more than 3,500 people had been approved to access medicinal cannabis under the Special Access Scheme.  In a statement, they said it was ""important to note that the TGA does not vouch for the quality, safety and effectiveness of unapproved medicinal cannabis products"". The Australian Medical Association (AMA) has consistently said the effectiveness of medicinal cannabis for treating pain and other health problems was still not proven. ""We don't know enough yet,"" Dr Kean Seng Lim said, NSW AMA president. ""All doctors tend to be conservative and err on the side of safety and that is entirely appropriate, to make sure as doctors we first do no harm to our patients. ""We really need to wait for the results of these trials to come out before we can make an educated choice on this matter."" In a 2016 report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 85 per cent of Australians were found to favour the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. Internationally, 30 countries have given the green light to medicinal cannabis in some capacity. There is only one medicinal cannabis product on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, which was approved for use in some patients with muscle spasm resulting from multiple sclerosis. Michael Balderston from the Hemp Embassy in Nimbin on the NSW north coast said the legal access the Australian Government had provided to medicinal cannabis products was too limited. ""They made it a tiny gateway … it's like the chain is still on the gate,"" Mr Balderston said. ""It's extremely hard to get permission through your doctor, [there are] lots of forms, two levels of doing it in some states, so I think doctors aren't inclined to do it and it has to be a really serious condition."" Mr Balderston also claimed the current research was not adequately testing the homegrown products that he believed were superior to the pharmaceutical cannabis products used in most clinical trials. ""So, people are finding ways to access it across Australia."" Mr Balderston advocated a licensing system for the cottage industry of people growing and making medicinal cannabis, with quality testing and limitations on supply. When challenged on the need for a health professional to know exactly what was in a drug to safely administer it, Mr Balderston said ""we could be telling people exactly what is in it, if we were allowed to test people's medicine that they are making"". ""It's a massive 'hemp-ployment', we call it,"" he said. In response to Mr Balderston's statements, the TGA said a medicinal cannabis product was required to meet the Therapeutic Goods Order (TGO) 93, which ensured the product did not contain more than defined limits for contaminants. The TGA also clarified that medicinal cannabis products being supplied via the Special Assistance Scheme and the approved prescriber pathways were ""unapproved products that have not been evaluated by the TGA for safety, quality and effectiveness"". In the meantime, it seems many senior Australians are choosing not to wait for scientific evidence to back up their personal experience. ""Where I got my medicinal cannabis, they supply probably 200 people a week, I would say 90 per cent of them have never had marijuana in their life, they've never taken an illegal drug in their life and they're ageing,"" Ms Vam Vas said. ""The fact that it's an illegal substance, that really disturbs me,"" Julie said. ""I hate having to live like this, but the benefits are so great I have to continue to break the law, because while it works I'll keep using it.""

31,"These people face excruciating pain daily, but medicinal cannabis makes life bearable",Mon 18 Feb 2019 at 7:26pm," These people face excruciating pain daily, but medicinal cannabis makes life bearable Christian Read has taken everything from period pain pills to heavy opioid-based medication to manage the severe pain he suffers from multiple sclerosis (MS). ""I have actually sat there and watched as my foot completely deformed in shape,"" he said. Mr Read has pain ""quite literally from head to toe"".  As well as spasms that contort different parts of his body, he experiences vision problems when his optic nerve swells, he is constantly battling exhaustion and is forced to deal with the side effects of being on the ""opioid treadmill"".    ""When you are dealing with chronic pain, when it's every day for years and it's not going to get better, you begin to develop particularly dark and unpleasant moods,"" he said.   After years of unrelenting pain, Mr Read approached a local GP about possible treatment with medicinal cannabis and was offered a low dose. He said ""within a week"" he realised it was making a difference.   ""It's been remarkable how quickly it transformed my day-to-day living,"" Mr Read said.  For patients like Mr Read, accessing alternatives such as medicinal cannabis had been difficult until the Federal Government relaxed restrictions in March 2018. New data obtained by the ABC revealed just how popular the controversial treatment had become, with more than 3,100 medicinal cannabis scripts approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) from March to January 2019. Those patients had a range of conditions, including nerve pain, anorexia, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and palliative care. Health authorities said, so far, no requests had been rejected. Mr Read said he was not totally off his traditional medication, but instead of a daily dose he was now more likely to be reaching for them once a month.  He said the medicinal cannabis had helped him ""reset to normal"".  ""My body itself stops becoming a locus of malfunction and I feel like I did before the symptoms became particularly damaging and painful,"" Mr Read said.  ""It helps my brain deal with the pain as it exists, rather than treatment for the pain itself.""  One notable difference he said, was sleep.  ""The effect on my quality of life is not to be underestimated,"" Mr Read said.  ""I sleep better, I manage my pain symptoms more easily [and] I have more energy because of that. I have a more positive outlook.""  Do you know more about this story? Email Specialist.Team@abc.net.au Beth McDougall had never touched pot in her life.

""From the very first night, I was nervous. I thought 'what's this going to be like?'"" Ms McDougall said.  ""I have never used cannabis [or] smoked drugs in my life, so I had no idea what the reaction would be.  ""Within 15 minutes, I just fell asleep."" Before using cannabis oil, Ms McDougall was waking every two hours to take strong painkillers such as oxycodone.  She now says she can sleep for up to six hours if she adds cannabis oil to her cocktail of medications. ""If you have a good sleep and you are not in pain, you will meet friends for lunch, or take the dog for a walk, or go for a swim, but if you are tired and cranky, you will say 'not today',"" she said. ""It hasn't been this 'wow' miracle cure. It's just made my life better."" Dr Judith Lacey, from the Chris O'Brien Lifehouse, prescribed very low doses of medicinal cannabis to many of her cancer patients.  ""I think the perception is that people would be feeling stoned and that their life with cancer would be walking around in a haze, but actually people are functioning very highly and feeling better control of their symptoms,"" she said.  Sydney GP Dr Teresa Towpik was initially sceptical about the usefulness of medicinal cannabis. ""I was quite ignorant and arrogant as well. I saw it as a drug of addiction, a gateway drug,"" she said. But since researching the benefits and prescribing it to her chronic pain patients, she has become an advocate. ""At least half of my patients have been able to reduce their pain medication or some of them even stop it,"" she said. GPs can apply to the TGA for approval for a script for individual patients or apply to become an authorised prescriber. So far, there are 54 authorised prescribers such as GPs and oncologists across Australia. Patients get a script from the doctor, which has to be approved by the TGA.  The patient takes it to a pharmacy, which orders the drug directly from the cannabis supplier.  Once the medicinal cannabis arrives at the chemist, the patient can pick it up.  Beth said she didn't feel high or tired when she used it. ""You don't feel anything. It just reduces the pain so I can get to sleep,"" she said. Dr Towpik said none of her patients had asked to increase the dose of medicinal cannabis they were taking. ""They are not asking for more, or exhibiting any drug-seeking behaviour,"" she said. Mr Read said he still felt embarrassment and concern about a stigma that this was a ""low drug for hippies"".  ""This is not a doctor handing you a joint in the back of a Combi,"" he said.  ""This is an effective drug, an effective medicine. Destigmatising it is important."" Director of the Australian Centre for Cannabinoid Clinical and Research Excellence Professor Jennifer Martin said when it came to the scientific evidence behind medicinal cannabis, the picture was mixed. ""The evidence of non-cancer pain is actually not that strong. There was a big review in the US a few years ago which suggested there would be some benefit for some patients,"" she said. ""But when the Australian team updated the information, they found we would have to treat 24 patients with this particular cannabinoid for one of them to get a reduction in their pain symptoms. ""Certainly some people that have taken cannabinoids do say they have had a lot of benefit, but we have also seen older patients who have had side effects."" She said it was better for patients to use drugs that had been registered by the TGA first, before trialling medicinal cannabis. Professor Martin said the scientific evidence of benefits was stronger for treating conditions such as kids with epilepsy who had not responded to medication. For patients like Mr Read and Ms McDougall, adding medicinal cannabis to their regime has improved their lives. ""It has been beneficial to my work because I'm not taking a huge amount of opioid medicine ... I just feel better, I feel more effective, I write more, I write more easily,"" Mr Read said.  ""The actual drug itself hasn't miraculously granted me health ... it just granted me the ability to engage in the world in a pain-free manner."" Ms McDougall said medicinal cannabis had given her some quality of life as she deals with advanced cancer. ""If you can wake up and feel like you haven't been hit by a bus, it really makes a difference,"" she said.

32,Why can Queenslanders with medicinal cannabis prescriptions be charged for drug possession?,Thu 6 Oct 2022 at 10:05pm," Why can Queenslanders with medicinal cannabis prescriptions be charged for drug possession? A Queensland woman who faced court on drug charges despite having a prescription for medicinal cannabis wants other unsuspecting users to be aware of the strict laws around carrying the substance. Sunshine Coast woman Hannah Scarlett Turner was charged with possession of less than one gram of a dangerous drug after being stopped by patrolling officers while walking her dog at a nature reserve at Tewantin in June. According to court documents, police were at the Butler Street location after receiving complaints about people ""smoking drugs in the area"". The documents show Ms Turner, who pleaded guilty to the charge, voluntarily told police she had a quantity of cannabis in her car. The 27-year-old said she had taken some of the prescription drug out of the labelled container, which was also in the car, and put it in a clip-sealed bag. Court transcripts show she was charged with possession a dangerous drug because the cannabis was not ""stored in the container where it was supposed to be kept"". ""It was the tiniest little bit that was left – less than a gram – and they give you these 10 gram canisters that are quite large, so if I have a tiny bit left, I'll put it in a little bag and have it in the container,"" Ms Turner said. She was prescribed the drug for PTSD, anxiety and insomnia and said she had no idea keeping the drug outside the original packaging was breaking the law. ""I just was not aware because I was never told that by my doctor,"" Ms Turner said. ""I was never told any information on how to store it."" During the 27-year-old's sentencing hearing in the Noosa Magistrates Court earlier this year, Magistrate Matthew McLaughlin conceded the drug was legally obtained and described Ms Turner's circumstances as ""an interesting conundrum"". He said he would have offered her a drug diversion program as her case was ideal for that type of sentencing, but Ms Turner had denied the referral previously. ""Once I have heard from your solicitor I have changed my mind, because what she has informed me is that the cannabis you had was actually legally obtained and the reason you are committing an offence is because you did not keep it stored in the container where it was supposed to be kept,"" Magistrate McLaughlin said. ""So what would be the point of sending you to a drug diversion course telling you about the evils of cannabis? ""One might think nothing at all, because you are going to continue smoking cannabis, because you're lawfully allowed to. ""So that is an interesting conundrum."" Ms Turner, who works in marketing, was handed a $300 good behaviour bond and had no conviction recorded. Ms Turner said more warnings should be given to prescription users about how to carry the drug. ""The biggest thing for me is I don't want someone to be put in that situation who doesn't have the resources like I do, who can't call their dad and get a good lawyer, who may potentially have epilepsy or Parkinson's disease and have their medication taken away from them,"" she said. ""People who are doing the right thing shouldn't be treated like criminals and there just needs to be more clarity around the law as well, because how are you supposed to do the right thing if you don't even know something as simple as that is breaking the law? ""It's kind of like it's set up against you — you're set up to kind of fail."" Clinical researcher Janet Schloss, from Southern Cross University's Faculty of Health, said there was a lack of education from medical practitioners about the way the patients should handle their drugs. ""There needs to be more education to the prescribers, particularly of any of the doctors that aren't doing it on a great regular basis, about what that person needs to do with they actually have that,"" she said. ""Particularly … if they actually take it out [of the canister], because really nobody actually gets told that."" Dr Schloss said the restrictions effectively required medicinal cannabis users — particularly those with chronic pain — to carry around large quantities of the drug. ""If it's a big container, you don't want to be carrying around that all the time,"" she said. ""Number one, it's quite bulky. Number two, it's a lot of money that you're carrying around. ""There's a big risk assessment that actually needs to occur."" Dr Schloss said there were still misconceptions about medicinal cannabis. ""It's based on stigmatism about cannabis, where legally they're actually able to have it for certain reasons versus actually recreationally smoking it,"" she said. Ms Turner agreed, saying her medicinal cannabis prescription had changed her life, but not everyone accepted her use of the drug. ""I was on so many different pharmaceutical drugs before and was a shell of who I am now,"" she said. ""There's still so much stigma around this plant that helps people live their lives to the fullest and that needs to change."" In a statement, Queensland Health said tight regulations regarding medicinal cannabis ensured that ""ongoing treatment is monitored by an authorised doctor and that the quality and consistency of the prescribed product meets national standards"". ""It also ensures the patient can continue using the prescribed treatment if they are admitted to hospital for any reason,"" the statement said. ""Like any lawfully prescribed and dispensed medicine, medicinal cannabis will have a label which confirms the name of the prescribing doctor and where the medicine was dispensed.""

34,Why so few Australians are using medicinal cannabis on prescription,"October 10, 2017 — 3.38pm","We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 5 years ago So often in Australia, we are astounded to discover that good policy has been subverted by political mismanagement. Think NBN, gas supply, the marriage plebiscite and … medicinal cannabis. A resounding 85 per cent of Australians support legislation permitting the use of cannabis for medical purposes. It is increasingly clear that many diseases can be treated by cannabis products that have little, if any, THC,  the main psychoactive ingredient.Credit:The Age And medical specialists can indeed apply to the Therapeutic Goods Administration to prescribe cannabis-based products to their patients under the Special Access and Authorised Prescriber schemes. However, the most recent figures show that only 153 patients nationwide have been authorised to receive medicinal cannabis products under the Special Access Scheme. And only about 30 Australian doctors have been granted Authorised Prescriber status, prescribing cannabis products to a further 101 patients. Meanwhile, we believe potentially 100,000 Australians are using cannabis to treat their medical conditions but because this is illegal, the true scale of this use is unknown. Such illicit use risks prosecution and all the complications that come with using an illegally sourced drug of uncertain composition. Cannabis-using ""criminals"" include thousands of people with severe, unrelenting pain who have reached the end of the line on the prescription opioid express.  It includes children with intractable epilepsy and people with painful neurological conditions, for whom cannabis has transformed their quality of life.  Concerns with cannabis usually revolve around the adverse effects of THC – the main psychoactive ingredient. While such effects are still hotly debated in scientific circles, it is increasingly clear that many diseases can be treated by cannabis products that have little, if any, THC. Many types of cannabis, including industrial hemp, contain little THC but are enriched in other cannabinoids such as cannabidiol, which have anti-epileptic, anti-anxiety, antipsychotic, anti-inflammatory and other therapeutic effects. And there is no need to smoke. Cannabis products now come in myriad forms, including oils, lozenges, sprays, lotions, patches and capsules. An initial problem facing Australian patients seeking medicinal cannabis is that their GPs often know very little about it, and unlike Canada, where GPs can write you a script, a sympathetic Australian GP must enlist the support of a specialist to apply to the TGA for cannabis products. And even if a specialist is available, and sympathetic, they are probably not covered by their insurer when prescribing cannabis products to patients. Let's assume your medical practitioners are courageous: the next step is a detailed application to the TGA outlining the scientific evidence showing that cannabis can treat your condition more effectively than conventional prescription meds. This leads to the stoush over ""the evidence"". Earlier this year, the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine released a comprehensive review medicinal cannabis. Evidence for the efficacy of cannabis in some diseases is sparse due to the historical barriers preventing clinical trials of cannabis products. But absence of evidence, as Carl Sagan said, is not evidence of absence. The NASEM report still gave resounding support for the use of cannabis products for pain, for nausea and vomiting in people receiving chemotherapy, for spasticity in multiple sclerosis, and for various forms of insomnia. But in Australia, the TGA is reluctant to approve the use of cannabis for the conditions for which it is most commonly used in the community: pain, insomnia and PTSD/anxiety. So the TGA will grant access to patients with less common conditions – such as multiple sclerosis and intractable epilepsy –  but not to the 20 per cent of Australians suffering from chronic pain. Even if your specialist can convince the TGA that your condition is treatable with cannabis products, your mission is still incomplete. Your specialist/GP must also apply to their state or territory health department for further approval. This involves more form-filling and delay. And when you finally have all your ducks in a row, there is the not-so-small issue of cost. The TGA-approved products available to patients are extremely expensive. It may cost $120 a day to obtain cannabis products to treat a child with pediatric epilepsy, with no subsidy available from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Putting it all together, it becomes clear why only 250 or so Australians have access to officially sanctioned medicinal cannabis products. In striking comparison, Canada has more than 200,000 officially approved patients, and Israel more than 30,000. Admittedly, it is early days in Australia and profound change does not happen overnight. Yet the design of the Australian system seems to almost guarantee its failure. There are several steps that could be taken to better meet community expectations: an amnesty for current users of illicit cannabis products with verified medical conditions would be a good start. Allowing appropriately trained GPs to prescribe medicinal cannabis products without specialist involvement would also help, as would dispensing with the need for duplicate state approvals.   Rescheduling of non-intoxicating, low-THC cannabis products as over-the-counter medicines might also be considered. When manufactured according to best practice, these products are no more hazardous than many of the nutraceuticals on pharmacy shelves. Let's rethink our strategy and make medicinal cannabis products readily available to Australians in need.

35,Could medicinal cannabis be the new frontier in treating period pain?,16 Jan 2020,"As those of us who've groped around our bathroom cabinets for anti-inflammatories while clutching heat packs to our aching abdomens know, sometimes being a woman is a massive pain. Literally. Dysmenorrhea - AKA  period pain - is incredibly common and in one out of five cases can be so severe it stops you from doing your daily activities. Dr Mike Armour from the National Institute of Complementary Medicine (NCIM) Health Research Institute at Western Sydney University, says period pain is especially prevalent in young women. About 90 per cent of Australian women under 25 suffer from period pain on a relatively regular basis. Despite that, there's not a whole lot of science or research into the condition. ""I think there's been a culture of silence around periods which means they can't be discussed. I often say that I can't talk about my research around the dinner table,"" Dr Armour told Hack. ""Women perhaps also don't know their periods are problematic or abnormal because they're often told by their mums, their friends or even their doctors that period pain is just normal, it's just part of being a woman and you just need to suck it up,"" he explains. Dr Armour says existing treatments for period pain, like over the counter pain medication, anti-inflammatories, heat packs and exercise, have their limitations. ""A lot of women say they remove some of my pain, but not all of it."" So he and fellow NICM researcher Justin Sinclair are looking at other treatments. Like medicinal cannabis. The pair conducted a small survey late last year on how women with endometriosis, a chronic and painful condition, manage their symptoms. Cannabis was brought up a lot. ""Over 50 per cent of women who were utilising cannabis for their symptoms in the survey, which was about one in 10, had a reduction of 50 per cent of their pharmaceutical usage,"" Mr Sinclair told Hack. ""They also showed fairly significant improvements across the domains of things like anxiety, depression, sleep, nausea, vomiting and gastro-intestinal upsets. These are fairly common symptoms that women with endometriosis experience,"" he says. Have you used cannabis to treat period pain? Tell us about your experience via DM or email at hack@abc.net.au  It led the pair to question whether medicinal cannabis had applications for primary dysmenorrhea - that is, period pain that's not caused by other conditions like endometriosis or polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). ""We're running some focus groups to find out what women are currently using, how they're managing their pain, what impact it's having and then have a discussion about how they would feel about using something like medicinal cannabis,"" Dr Armour says. You don't have to have previously used cannabis to manage pain to take part in the focus group. ""We're looking for around 20 women aged 18 to 45, and they need to have moderate or greater period pain and they need to have no known cause for that period pain such as a diagnosis of endometriosis."" The results of that focus group will determine if there's enough evidence to progress to a clinical trial. If you're interested in participating in the focus group, you can find out more here. Mr Sinclair says medicinal cannabis is hard to access for pain relief. ""There are doctors that are prescribing legal medicinal cannabis for endometriosis at the moment... They prescribe for chronic pain in adults, and what doctors can do is they can put in chronic pain secondary to endometriosis."" But it's still rare. ""I've got three doctors that have contacted me now saying they've all had successful applications for that."" Mr Sinclair says finding a doctor to prescribe medicinal cannabis remains one of the biggest barriers for patients. ""Their doctors might not be educated...They might be dismissive to their patients,"" he says. Even if patients find an authorised prescriber of medicinal cannabis, the impact on their wallets can make them think twice. The cost around legal cannabis can be anywhere between $250 and $350 a month, which is larger than you'd pay in the illicit market. Mr Sinclair says stigma, and concern over breaking the drug-driving laws or workplace health and safety requirements, are the other barriers. ""Currently if you got pulled over and tested by a roadside drug test, theoretically the police would still be able to prosecute you. Obviously, it would go to court, and we're not sure what would happen there, but there's no changes to the drug-driving laws for medicinal cannabis laws,"" he says. The ACT last year legalised cannabis for recreational use. Those laws will come into place at the end of January. However, the territory has not altered its drug-driving laws, and drivers can still be tested for traces of cannabis. We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the

There is still a lot of confusion around the product, from whether it's legal, if you are allowed to drive and if the product you are using actually contains THC and makes you feel high. We are seeing a growing number of people easily obtaining their medicinal cannabis from online suppliers with limited medical consultations, and now many GPS and other medical professionals are calling for tighter regulation of prescription and distribution.So as it becomes more common and more accepted, what do we still need to know and learn — and do some areas need tighter regulation to ensure that the market doesn't get flooded by cowboys who are more interested in profit then your health?

37,"Tasmanians approved to use medicinal cannabis hope for reduced seizures, pain relief",Sat 17 Feb 2018 at 9:13pm," Tasmanians approved to use medicinal cannabis hope for reduced seizures, pain relief Kaye Dick wishes she could forget the harm seizures have caused her son Joe, ending in breaking many of his bones. Mr Dick has suffered severe epilepsy since he was two, and Ms Dick said it seemed like the attacks and accompanying seizures had left few bones unbroken. Ms Dick is hoping her son will get some relief, as one of the first Tasmanians approved under the state's medicinal cannabis scheme, which got underway in late 2017. ""Every 20 days or so, he'll have a seizure period over two days of about four big seizures, where he can end up in hospital ... or with something broken,"" Ms Dick said. ""It all depends where he falls and what he falls on.  ""He's ended up in Hobart hospital with a broken orbit bone around his face, he's broken his collarbone, [and] he's broken his nose I don't know how many times. ""He's broken a wrist ...[and] I think he did do an ankle at one stage, but I've never kept a record of that because I don't want to remember it.""  Mr Dick displayed little sign of pain as he played with the family's racing pigeons in their backyard at Kindred in the state's north-west. But while the 27-year-old remains passionate about his birds, his mother said other skills and hobbies had been lost, as his condition deteriorated with every major seizure. ""It's horrible, bloody awful. It's like ... having a major car accident, and having brain damage, and you're not be able to do anything,"" she said. ""He used to be able to write — write stories and sentences and things — and do diaries at school, but he can't do that anymore. ""He used to be able to fill in worksheets ... [but]  he can't do that anymore either. He's just lost some of his skills.""   In an attempt to stem the seizures, Ms Dick has just started treating her son with medically prescribed cannabis. Mr Dick is one of the first approved for the drug under the State Government's controlled access scheme, and began receiving the medicine a fortnight ago. He has initially been prescribed five of the Swiss-made capsules a day, which don't contain the THC that causes most of marijuana's psychological effects.   Ms Dick said she hoped the medicine would ""cut the seizures out"". ""I'm hoping it halts, and he stays as he is,"" she said. ""I don't think in myself he'll be able to gain these skills back again because the damage has been done to the brain."" For Wendy Latimer, medicinal cannabis is also viewed as her last hope of a better life. On average, the 57-year-old suffers one large seizure a day, and about 100 smaller ones, in what her carer Lee-Anne Aulich described as ""one of the most severe cases of epilepsy"" she had seen in her 20-year career. ""Some days you can see that it effects her significantly, other days she pushes through and you just admire the way that she does live her days,"" she said Wendy Latimer's sister Kay Elphinston said the family was hopeful about the potential of the treatment. ""Wendy's been on every medication that is possible for her, she's trialled everything, so this medical marijuana is probably the last resort,"" she said. ""Obviously we're hoping for some decrease in the seizures and probably, we feel it might help the pain.""  Before both families received their first prescription, research was conducted by private company Seer Medical. The company's staff monitored the pair at home constantly for a week. Electrodes attached to the scalp monitored changes in brain waves, while a moveable security camera filmed each seizure activity. The testing will continue regularly over the next six months, and Seer's managing director Dean Freestone said he hoped the data would provide a valuable insight into the effect of medicinal cannabis. ""It captures information about their epilepsy and also we can understand their behaviour and in that we can understand how they're reacting to different drugs,"" Dr Freestone said. ""What we're finding is that it does give a very good gauge on how well patients are responding to their medications and new therapies, therefore we think this is going to be a fantastic and revolutionising new types of treatments."" Since the Government's controlled access scheme began at the start of September, just three people have received approval for the treatment. Kay Elphinston said more people deserved a chance at the drug. ""It has been a bit stringent, the application process has been very stringent,"" she said. ""My heart goes out to the people that I know that have got children or adults with epilepsy that haven't been able to get access.""

38,Medical cannabis workshop: 'incredibly cumbersome' to get drugs to patients,,"David Caldicott, a senior medical lecturer, tells seminar about cannabis’s effectiveness in treating pain and vomiting from chemotherapy Australia’s first doctors’ workshop on the medical uses of cannabis has heard about the complex situation around its legality. The Melbourne conference was held with the hope of improving the medical profession’s awareness about the issue. They hope to help doctors across the country clarify how the drug can be used and the legal situation, which can differ from state to state. David Caldicott, a senior medical lecturer at Australian National University told Guardian Australia there was a lack of clarity among both doctors and patients due to confusing government frameworks. “I’m not a lawyer but even I am struggling with this. If you go to different states in Australia you see very different responses. It is still incredibly cumbersome to get drugs to patients. There are still a lot of loopholes, and people are still regularly being prosecuted.” Caldicott said the seminar on Thursday informed doctors about its effectiveness in treating pain, nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy, and paediatric seizures.  He said it was well received, and was surprised with the amount of interest. “We’ve never had such positive feedback for any course we’ve ever run. We were only planning on giving the course to a dozen or 15 people, but we had to change the venue twice because the final headcount was 70.” Caldicott said no medical school in Australia currently provided training on how to use medicinal cannabis. Under federal law, the use of medicinal cannabis is legal, but it can only be prescribed in certain cases that vary state to state. In Queensland and Tasmania, only specialists can prescribe the drug, while in NSW it can only be prescribed to children with severe drug-resistant epilepsy. In February, health minister Greg Hunt fast-tracked the import of approved medicinal cannabis supplies because Australian production was not yet sufficient. Caldicott criticised the legal framework for medicinal cannabis for being cumbersome. “While it is technically legal to avail yourself of cannabis medicine, it is practically impossible,” he said. “Australia is the only country in the world who have tried to drive home the square peg of medicinal cannabis through the round hole of traditional medical legislation. This framework was never designed for this scenario. It’s like trying to use an old railway gauge for a super-fast turbo train.” Though medicinal cannabis is legal, it has still not been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. According to Caldicott, the TGA has also only issued 29 licenses to domestic producers despite the “tens of thousands of people who need to use it”. “All the problems that are reported with cannabis have almost exclusively been reported with recreational consumption. The confounding of medicinal and recreational cannabis is like the confounding of morphine and heroin. It really is apples and oranges.” On Thursday a new industry body, the Medical Cannabis Council, launched itself as a peak body for local medical cannabis production. In March, a survey from Sydney University said 14% of epilepsy suffers had used cannabis products to manage their seizures, with a 90% success rate for adults and 71% for children.",10,528
39,Coronavirus buy-local trend driving demand for Australian-grown medicinal cannabis,Sat 1 Aug 2020 at 8:35am,"ABC Rural An Australian medical cannabis company says the rise of the buy-local movement during COVID-19 driven has up demand for locally produced cannabinoid products. Little Green Pharma (LGP) is based at a secret location in WA's South West and has experienced a boom in sales since the pandemic began. Chief operating officer Paul Long said the trend was being driven by a range of social and economic factors stemming from the health crisis and not necessarily by a spike in patient numbers. ""I think COVID has put pressure on supply chains, so companies that have been importing products from outside Australia, and particularly from Canada ... have seen some challenges, with some outages of product,"" he said. ""There's also been this feel of 'let's support locally grown, let's support Australian business', so we've benefited from that throughout COVID and seen an uplift during the last two to three months. ""Since we started in August 2018 we've had just over 6,500 patients, but in the last three months alone we've seen 1,300 new patients."" Demand for cannabis products had been growing exponentially before the health crisis, Mr Long said.  LGP was predominantly focused on the potential of the domestic market, despite export prospects ramping up in Europe, including the UK and Germany, he said. ""Expert reports show that medicinal cannabis products get to about 1 to 2 per cent of the population, so if you look at total numbers in Australia, we've got a long way to go in that growth, which is exciting for the industry as a whole."" Advocates say medicinal cannabis offers effective relief when other treatments are failing. But Australian guidelines say there's limited evidence to support its use. Matty Moore has been prescribing medicinal cannabis for about 12 months. While legally restricted from discussing the benefits of medicinal cannabis products for his patients, he said he had been prescribing more than ever. He said conditions he treated using the medicine included chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, cancer pain and insomnia, with patients mostly aged 60 and over. ""It's an increasing part of what I'm doing. Each week I'm seeing more and more new patients, and at some point it will be a significant part of my business.""  Dr Moore said the medical profession was becoming more open to prescribing medicinal cannabis as a treatment option. ""The age-old bias is hard to break from last century when cannabis was looked down upon and tightly controlled,"" he said. ""We're behind on its use, but we're catching up ... it's tightly regulated and that means that we compile evidence and data. ""We're all evidence-based physicians, so as we get more and more evidence, people will be more comfortable prescribing it for their patients."" With an increasing number of doctors prescribing cannabinoid products for pain relief, medicinal cannabis is tipped to become a billion-dollar business in Australia. The WA Government wants to ensure the state gets a piece of the pie, recently providing a $300,000 grant to LGP to facilitate an expansion of its manufacturing operations.  LGP now has the capacity to produce up to 110,000 bottles of finished medicine for the Australian market each year. Agriculture Minister Alannah MacTiernan is behind the push to ramp up medicinal cannabis production in WA. She believes the industry is a huge opportunity for the state. ""We see great potential for CBD production in pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals,"" she said. ""[We want] to make sure that we here in WA are leading producers, not just Australia-wide but that we become major players internationally. ""Not only is the industry going to help millions of people around the world ... it's going to drive a brilliant new industry full of interesting jobs here in the South West.""

40,Medicinal cannabis a step closer with legislation to allow cultivation,,"Health minister Sussan Ley says a bill to allow cannabis to be grown for use in medical trials will be introduced on Wednesday and passed this sitting Patients suffering chronic and painful illnesses are a step closer to accessing medicinal cannabis. Legislation allowing the controlled cultivation of the plant for medicinal or scientific purposes through a national scheme will be introduced to parliament by the Turnbull government on Wednesday. Health minister Sussan Ley wants the laws passed in this sitting, saying it will open the way for sick Australians to get access to relief. The government had worked closely with the states and territories, law enforcement agencies and stakeholders over the past eight weeks to ensure a smooth passage through parliament, she said. “This is an important day for Australia and the many advocates who have fought long and hard to challenge the stigma around medicinal cannabis products,” she said. “For Australia, this is the missing piece in a patient’s journey.” There are already laws allowing legal production and distribution of medicinal cannabis, Ley says but Australia doesn’t have a safe, legal and reliable supply of locally-grown cannabis. She said creating one nationally-consistent cultivation scheme, rather than having separate ones in each state and territory, would speed up access to medicinal cannabis. A national regulator will allow government to monitor medicinal cannabis from cultivation to supply and curtail attempts by criminals to get involved, she said. “The commonwealth will licence and issue permits and in so doing meet our international obligations to say we know what’s being grown, where and what actually happens to the crop,” Ley says. “What we need is a domestic supply. We need to provide that missing piece, allows the States to cultivate, to manufacture, to have clinical trials and research and actually take this to the next step.”",10,303
41,'Green wave': Businesses look to medicinal cannabis,"February 4, 2019 — 12.01am","We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 4 years ago With cannabis legalised in some parts of Australia for medicinal use, businesses are positioning themselves for what is tipped to be a 'green wave' of opportunity. For Sean Dollinger, chief executive and co-founder of Canadian based company Namaste Technologies, that means regular visits to Australia and an upcoming collaboration with controversial celebrity chef Pete Evans for a cannabis cook book. ""Australia is Namaste’s largest marketplace without cannabis being legal,"" says Dollinger. ""We expect to do $10 million here and that is just on the vaporisers side, imagine when cannabis and CBD [Cannabidiol] open up. It's a very important market for us."" Sean Dollinger, chief executive and co-founder of Namaste Technologies. Credit:Louise Kennerley The 38-year-old entrepreneur started Namaste Technologies from his garage ""selling a few vaporisers a day"" and he now describes the online marketplace as a ""one stop shop"" for anything cannabis. Namaste Technologies operates in 20 countries and is listed in Canada with a market capitalisation which has gone as high as $1 billion but Dollinger's ambitions are even larger. ""Netflix and Amazon are some of the leading AI [artificial intelligence] machine learning websites in the world,"" he says. ""When you visit their websites you see something completely different to what I see. That's essentially what we are implementing into our website."" A 'green wave' is driving demand for cannabis.Credit:Rohan Thomson Dollinger says the Namaste Technologies website will suggest related products to users based on their purchasing and browsing history. ""I’m not saying I’m [Jeff] Bezos or [Richard] Branson or a [Elon] Musk yet, but I am hopefully one day going to have a company as large as theirs if not bigger,"" he says. Dollinger is enthusiastic about the growth opportunities in Australia with the federal government legalising patient access to Australian-grown and manufactured medicinal cannabis in 2016, while states and territories have their own legislation controlling its prescription and use. ""Each country has different rules and perspectives,"" he says. ""Australia obviously limits the scope of what we use medical cannabis for but when you look at Canada, that is where Canada was a bunch of years ago. Canada has done a wonderful job of rolling out the product from a medical to a recreational product."" Dollinger wants countries including Australia to use Canada as a framework. ""Hopefully three to five years from now we will start to see wider uses of cannabis in Australia and we will hopefully evolve our platform as the rules and regulations change,"" he says. In the meantime Dollinger says the main challenge to Namaste Technologies' continued growth is dealing with different jurisdictions and legislation. ""In Australia we need to be extremely careful and always abide by the rules,"" he says. While Namaste Technologies sees medicinal cannabis as opening up the Australian market for cannabis related products, Australian businesses are looking to medical grade cannabis as an export crop. ASX-listed Australian cannabis producers stocks soared last year when the federal government approved therapeutic marijuana products for export. Independently owned medicinal cannabis focused company, Australian Natural Therapeutics Group (ANTG), is one of a handful of Australian companies which have received a federal licence allowing them to cultivate and harvest cannabis for medicinal purposes. Matt Cantelo, chief executive at ANTG. Matt Cantelo, chief executive and co-founder of ANTG, says the business has signed an agreement with European giant Cannamedical Pharma to export Australian grown cannabis for German patients. ""Australian growing conditions from plant composition perspective are the most ideal in the world,"" he says. ""The Australian sun puts the plants under positive distress and produces a fairly potent product."" Cantelo says ANTG has invested ""multi million dollars"" in its growing facilities. ""We are investing heavily in the early stages in capital at the moment,"" he says. He hopes that medical cannabis will be more frequently prescribed in Australia at the moment with authorities granting 2500 approvals for legal use of the medicine in the past year. ""The medical profession really needs to be educated further than it is now,"" he says.  ""Australian doctors are quite conservative and do want to see this on home soil as well. We are at the very start of what will be one of the most booming industries in the world."" The Australian Medical Association supports clinical trials of medical cannabis to establish clinical guidelines before wider promulgation throughout the community. In the meantime, ANTG's product has found a ready market in Germany with Cannamedical Pharma sold out of medical cannabis for the next 90 days. ""Our biggest limitation is that we have too little supply coming to the German market,"" says David Henn, chief executive of Cannamedical Pharma.

42,Outdoor medicinal cannabis trial crop in Victoria hoped to provide affordable access for those in need,Tue 14 Jul 2020 at 8:23pm," Outdoor medicinal cannabis trial crop in Victoria hoped to provide affordable access for those in need In a secret location near Swan Hill, an organic trial crop of medicinal cannabis has been growing out in the paddock in full daylight. It is hoped the potent plants will yield well, resulting in accelerated planting later this year. Murray Meds managing director, Nan-Marie Schoerie, said outdoor facilities are not common in Australia. ""It's very much the way the global trend is going,"" she said. ""There are a number of medicinal cannabis facilities that are being established … but these are all what they call protective cropping or indoor growers that have large greenhouses and significant amount of infrastructure.""  Ms Schoerie said they had high hopes when it came to growing in a conventional way. ""The cost of growing outdoors is significantly lower,"" she said.  ""And so it's much more of a traditional agricultural crop. ""It's going directly in the ground, it gets its energy from the sun, not from lighting, and we draw our water directly from the river."" Advocates say medicinal cannabis offers effective relief when other treatments are failing. But Australian guidelines say there's limited evidence to support its use. Once the cannabis is collected it is sent off to a drying room where humidity and moisture is tightly controlled. ""So we harvest flowers, and we send them to an extractor and the extractor then extracts the cannabinoids out of the flower and then you formulate [that] into an oil or a control unit,"" Ms Schoerie said. ""They do soft gel capsules and things like that. But what we're doing is really providing an active ingredient that goes into the products that we grow the cannabinoids — or the THC and the CBD."" Ms Schoerie said the idea to move into medicinal cannabis rather than hemp food and fibre was to make marijuana affordable to those most in need. ""The main reason behind us doing what we're doing [is] that we realised pretty early on, when friends were looking at using cannabis or people that were on chemotherapy, or really not well, as soon as they went through the process of getting prescriptions … they just could not afford it,"" she said. ""They just found it ridiculously expensive."" The Murray Meds team have been applying regenerative farming techniques to the pilot planting. ""We planted really late … we were impacted by COVID-19,"" Ms Schoerie said. ""Our seeds got stuck in Europe literally at the time that it happened. The seeds were due to come in March [but] they only arrived in the middle of April. ""So we planted a small crop just to go through what we call proof of concept … but it wouldn't be a normal planting season. ""The typical planting season is September, October and you'd harvest in May, so you can imagine us planting in April — that's not what was supposed to happen."" Ms Schoerie said despite a late start, it was important to go through the process for a number of reasons. ""We understood that it was better to get a crop in the ground and go through the process and harvest it and see how we went,"" she said. This approach also meant the team kept their jobs during the coronavirus pandemic. Subscribe to Rural RoundUp: Stories from rural and regional Australia, every Friday. ""We managed to keep our employees employed through this period, where if we had to let them go because of COVID-19 then they would have really struggled, so we're pretty pleased to be able to keep them on board,"" Ms Schoerie said. ""We have solar power for energy, we're really focused on sustainable farming. ""So you make sure that before you start planting the soil, the quality of the soil is really, really good and that reduces the amount of food that you need to provide."" Five different strains of cannabis were used in trying to create the best mix. A growing number of senior Australians are buying homemade medicinal cannabis products for pain relief, despite it being early days in scientific research to support the drug's effectiveness. ""The reason for that is really just to work through our genetics and find the best plants that are most suited to this climate and will give us the best yield — the best defence against any pests etc,"" Ms Schoerie said. ""The crop that we just planted is what they call an auto flower, so that takes eight to 12 weeks from propagation to harvest, and they don't grow very big — about one to one-and-a-half metres. ""The other type of crop and the main type of crops that [we] will be growing is what they call photo period or full season planter — so traditional plants and that can go any where up to two metres, even more if we let it."" And if all goes to plan, they may have already lined up potential buyers. ""We are we already in conversation with some companies in Europe that are looking to acquire our product,"" she said.

43,Turnbull says One Nation’s medicinal cannabis amnesty 'irresponsible',,"PM says government doesn’t have power for an amnesty and also says it’s unlikely classified information leaked when ministers’ Yahoo accounts hacked Malcolm Turnbull has rejected One Nation’s proposed medicinal cannabis amnesty, saying the government does not have the power and an amnesty for dangerous illicit substances would be “irresponsible”. In an interview with ABC radio in Brisbane, the prime minister also reassured Australians that it was “unlikely” classified information had leaked as the result of Yahoo accounts of ministers being compromised in 2013. Immediately before the interview Steve Dickson, the former Queensland Liberal National party MP who defected to One Nation on Friday over the cannabis issue, told ABC that calling an amnesty would help Turnbull demonstrate he had “not lost touch”. Queensland has passed a bill legalising the use of medicinal suppliers but there are no licensed suppliers yet in Australia, raising fears that people could be prosecuted for using the drug for pain relief. “We don’t have the power to issue a general amnesty,” Turnbull said. He warned the health department was concerned people were “treating themselves with a powerful medicine sourced from elicit market” because there were “no controls on the safety and quality of medicines bought this way”. Turnbull cited the example of two women in New South Wales hospitalised because the strength of cannabis used in their treatment was “much higher than expected”. “It would be irresponsible to be giving a free-ranging amnesty over conduct that is against the law ... And may well involve using substances that are very very dangerous indeed.” He said the government had set up a medicinal cannabis licensing scheme to allow for cultivation of safe products but conceded none were yet licensed in Australia. Turnbull said medicinal cannabis could be imported under a Therapeutic Goods Administration scheme, if it was prescribed by a doctor. Addressing Pauline Hanson’s claim she was invited to Donald Trump’s inauguration and the fact he was not, the prime minister said his understanding was it was not the practice to invite foreign leaders such as himself and he “wouldn’t lose a moment’s sleep” if a One Nation parliamentarian attended. Turnbull appeared uncertain of what the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had already confirmed, that Australia’s ambassador, Joe Hockey, would attend. Turnbull said Hockey would attend if other diplomats did. Turnbull said Hockey had secured excellent access to the incoming Trump administration and he had personally spoken to Trump about the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He attacked Labor for refusing to pledge support for a parliamentary motion in favour of the TPP. On Tuesday ABC reported that thousands of Australian government officials, including high-profile politicians and senior defence officials, were among the one billion victims of the Yahoo data breach in 2013. Among those reportedly affected were the social services minister, Christian Porter, the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, the Liberal MP Andrew Hastie, the opposition health spokeswoman, Catherine King, and the Liberal senator Cory Bernardi. Turnbull said he had not been compromised in the Yahoo attack. He offered IT advice from his time as chairman of OzEmail including setting up two-factor identification and setting better passwords than “password”, “internet” or “computer”. Turnbull said he would get a report from his cybersecurity adviser, Alastair MacGibbon, about the Yahoo leak but noted since it occurred in 2013 it may have been before the Coalition was elected to government. “It begs the question as to what was in those accounts and clearly, in terms of classified government information, can only be transmitted and used on approved government communications systems.” Turnbull concluded it would be “very unlikely” there were security issues for the named politicians. On Tuesday MacGibbon told ABC TV there hadn’t been any indication that sensitive government information was on any of the politicians’ or officials’ accounts. “It’s just that they used a government email address as a recovery email address, if they lost their password, for example,” he said. “There is a chance that criminals would blackmail people. I would say if they wanted to do it, they would have done it already.” MacGibbon said politicians were supposed to keep personal and public emails separate, so it was good that they had separate accounts. Turnbull offered support for the Liberal MP Andrew Laming, but said his daughter, Daisy, who is a teacher, had expressed concern about his comments on the supposedly generous working hours of Queensland teachers. “She had a very strong reaction, so I think Andrew will have received some very emphatic feedback from teachers in his electorate and elsewhere,” he said. Turnbull said teachers worked very hard and were “at the front line of our future”.",8,776
44,Medicinal cannabis campaigner Dan Haslam dies after battle with cancer,Tue 24 Feb 2015 at 10:54pm," Medicinal cannabis campaigner Dan Haslam dies after battle with cancer One of the key campaigners behind the bid to legalise cannabis use for terminally ill people in New South Wales has died. Dan Haslam, 25, was surrounded by friends and family when he died at his home in Tamworth on Tuesday, after a five-year battle with bowel cancer. Mr Haslam came to national attention in 2014, when he and his family went public with the story of his experience using medicinal cannabis as a way to manage the effects of his cancer treatment. The Haslam family has since been campaigning for the medicinal use of the drug to be made legal. NSW is now running three medical trials that allow children with severe epilepsy, adults with terminal illnesses and people with nausea caused by chemotherapy to use medical cannabis. Mr Haslam's mother Lucy Haslam told the ABC New England North West Morning program that her son did not stop fighting until the end. ""He just became the champion of the cause for so many people that didn't feel they could use their own voice to come out in support for medical cannabis,"" she said. ""He was very easy to love, I don't think he had any enemies."" Mrs Haslam said her son had helped thousands of people. ""He was just someone seeking medicine, nothing more nothing less,"" she said. ""There are so many people that aren't having their needs met with the medications that are available. ""Let's strive for a bit better for those people. ""If something that works for them, if it can't do them any harm, the fact that it's illegal, I think that's just craziness."" There will be a public memorial for Mr Haslam in Tamworth next week. During his cancer treatment for Mr Haslam said he found cannabis offered him some relief from the nausea, vomiting and poor appetite caused by chemotherapy. Mr Haslam met with NSW Premier Mike Baird in July to discuss decriminalising medical cannabis. Following news of his death Mr Baird released a statement saying he was saddened by Mr Haslam's death and was struck by his courage and bravery when they first met. ""His determination, not just to beat his disease, but also to make a difference for others, is an inspiration to all, and certainly was to me,"" he said. ""I will never forget the look in his eyes the first time I met him and it will stay with me forever."" Mr Baird said Mr Haslam's campaign would have a lasting effect on the people of NSW. ""Dan made a lasting impression on everyone he met, but, more than that, he left a legacy in NSW that will be felt across the nation, and I believe the world,"" he said. ""Every step we take on medical cannabis will be built on the footsteps he left behind. ""My thoughts at this sad time are with Dan's parents Lucy and Lou, his wife Alyce and his brothers Billy and Luke, as well as his many friends. RIP Dan, we will all miss you.""

45,First harvest at medicinal cannabis facility near Mildura in Victoria's north-west,Fri 3 Jun 2022 at 8:01am," First harvest at medicinal cannabis facility near Mildura in Victoria's north-west Cann Group has begun harvesting at a ""first of its kind"" medical cannabis facility in north-west Victoria. A ""smaller than normal"" first batch has been harvested from the facility near Mildura, which was built in a former fruit juice factory. Chief operating officer Shane Duncan said despite some challenges, he was ""really happy"" with a healthy first batch. ""The next step is to dry it and then test it to see what the cannabinoid levels are,"" he said. ""Probably for the next few months, we'll take smaller than normal crops … just to ensure that we've got all the systems dialled in correctly: the fertigation, lighting, temperature controls, humidity controls. ""But by July or August, we'll really be in a position to start to ramp up production."" A new crop is now expected to be harvested every two weeks. Mr Duncan said the crop would be dried for several days to reduce moisture before it was sent away for manufacturing, which involves extracting cannabinoids out of the plant and making oil, tincture or capsules for medical use. In addition to cultivation, Mr Duncan hopes processing will also soon be done locally at the facility, with TGA approval of a manufacturing licence expected later this month. ""We've been commissioning and running pilot batches [making medical capsules] for a number of months now, so manufacturing on a level has been going for a while at the facility,"" he said. ""But before we can really release any of that product into the market, we need that licence."" Mr Duncan said there was 33 full-time staff currently on site, and he expected that to expand to ""somewhere between 50 and 60"" by the end of the year. The Victorian government said the $115 million facility was the ""first-of-its-kind"" in Australia and would eventually have the capacity to grow up to 70,000 kilograms of dried cannabis flowers per year. They estimate the project, including the construction of the 13.5-hectare facility, would deliver $191 million to the Mildura regional economy.

46,Medicinal cannabis trial begins for Australian veterans with PTSD,Tue 11 Jun 2019 at 8:08pm," Medicinal cannabis trial begins for Australian veterans with PTSD An Australian-first trial using medicinal cannabis to treat returned servicemen and women suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been launched today that targets defence personnel who have not had a response to conventional treatments. The investigation, coordinated by Cannabis Access Clinics, will run over the next 12 months. Lead researcher Dr Sharron Davis said traditional treatments did not really work for PTSD. ""It can present itself in lots of different ways, so it's very difficult to find a treatment that is going to treat all of the symptoms of PTSD,"" Dr Davis said. Researchers are seeking 300 people to take part in the national trial, which has already attracted attention from the veteran community. ""We have to be able to show the Therapeutic Goods Administration that these people have tried everything conventional medicine has to offer,"" Dr Davis said. The study will see individuals prescribed a baseline dose of the oil that uses the non-psychoactive part of medicinal cannabis, referred to as CBD. The project is being carried out in conjunction with BOD Australia, a global health and wellness business. BOD Australia spokesperson Jo Patterson said participants might start with a dose of 5 millilitres. ""They might be on the product for up to five weeks — obviously it's an observational trial, so they'll assess the benefits that the product is offering the patient,"" Ms Patterson said. Ms Patterson said it was difficult to anticipate if the product would be available for mainstream purchase in future, but said it could be at least five years, depending on the results of the trial. Dr Davis said she hoped the product would eventually become a freely available supplement like olive leaf oil. ""I would like to see CBD-only oil reclassified — it has no psychoactive effects whatsoever,"" Dr Davis said. The Australian Defence Force (ADF) reports about 8.3 per cent of its members will have experienced PTSD in the past 12 months. The rates among males in the ADF is almost double the general community. Former soldier Michael Handley left the army in 1998 after he said he had lost his way. The veteran did peacekeeping tours to Somalia and Bougainville in the 1990s. In 2001, Mr Handley was diagnosed with PTSD, 10 years after he first enlisted. ""You are in this big rut, this big hole, everything seems to be closing in and you just feel half the person you used to be,"" Mr Handley said. ""I was continually getting aggressive at little things — I would tend to walk away and just isolate myself."" Mr Handley said traditional therapies to treat the disorder simply had not worked for him. ""Some of the meds I'd take I would take at night time and I wouldn't wake up until after lunchtime the next day,"" Mr Handley said. ""I was becoming, in a sense, addicted to these opiates and abusing them."" Since leaving the military, Mr Handley had made it his mission to help others adjust to civilian life through his organisation RedSix. Through creating an online community, the concept is aimed at helping lower the growing suicide rate among veterans.  Mr Handley said considering his own struggles with PTSD, he had jumped at the opportunity to be part of the trial looking at the use of CBD oil. ""I think the veterans having another avenue to help with signs and symptoms and treatment of PTSD can only be beneficial for us,"" Mr Handley said.

47,Medicinal cannabis red tape slashed to provide faster access to NSW patients,Fri 2 Mar 2018 at 4:05am," Medicinal cannabis red tape slashed to provide faster access to NSW patients Patients in New South Wales will be able to access medicinal cannabis within days of a doctor prescribing it, in what the federal Health Minister says sets a national benchmark. Health Minister Greg Hunt said the State and Federal Governments had ""taken a machete"" to red tape in order to provide ""direct and immediate access"" to medicinal cannabis. Instead of both the Commonwealth and NSW Health overseeing the approvals, NSW will rely on a single clinical assessment by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). Current regulations mean the approval process through the states and the TGA can take months. Mr Hunt said the changes would come into effect in the coming weeks. ""Where the doctors say it is required, we'll make sure it is available in a matter of days,"" he said. ""New South Wales is now the national leader — we have had tremendous discussions with Tasmania and Victoria, and so I am hopeful that will make progress with them very shortly — but the benchmark has been set here and this is about saving lives and protecting lives, it's about giving people the capacity to go through their treatments."" NSW Minister for Health and Medical Research Brad Hazzard said the change would make a huge difference to patients. ""When people have got that diagnosis of cancer and they are having the treatment, they are having the chemo, they obviously often feel very sick, nauseous, vomiting,"" Mr Hazzard said. ""This will allow a very fast response to allow them to get access to what can be … certainly a medicine that can assist you with the nausea and the vomiting. ""It also can assist children who suffer fits from a range of illnesses."" But Mr Hazzard foreshadowed challenges in convincing medical practitioners that they could prescribe the drug in certain circumstances. ""For that reason NSW has a $6 million advisory service that we established just a few months ago, and what that enables doctors to do is make a phone call and find out how can medicinal cannabis possibly assist your patient,"" he said. ""There are many negatives if not managed appropriately."" The Medical Cannabis Council welcomed the move to harmonise the prescription approval processes, but cautioned access to medical cannabis for patients in NSW was still not guaranteed. The industry group said many doctors treated medicinal cannabis as a ""medication of last resort"".

48,Buying legal marijuana is as easy as picking up the phone. Here’s how I did it,"September 28, 2022","We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 6 months ago Top-quality legal cannabis can be in your letterbox within days. And prescriptions have soared by almost 4000 per cent. By Jordan Baker Australian Natural Therapeutics Group CEO Matthew Cantelo among marijuana plants in NSW.Credit:Janie Barrett Australians’ use of medicinal cannabis is surging, driven by easy over-the-phone prescriptions and products that are better quality, more reliable and cheaper than the illegal “green” market. In 2018, there were fewer than 3000 prescriptions. Last year, more than 120,000 were issued, federal government data shows, mostly for chronic pain, anxiety and sleep disorders, but also for cancer, ADHD and migraines. Yet as the industry evolves, even its most ardent supporters say it has a long way to go. It is hampered by issues ranging from driving prohibitions, cost and lingering stigma, to a lack of rigorous evidence, scepticism from the medical community, and concerns about cowboy prescribers who have a financial interest in giving it to patients too easily. The loose approach by some medical clinics is also raising suspicions of a booming de-facto recreational market; the biggest growth in prescriptions since 2020 has been high THC plant products for men aged between 18 and 31, traditionally the stoner demographic. “This isn’t Amsterdam, mate,” one doctor said in response to the subset of his patients seeking boutique products. Users swear by the medical benefits of cannabis. Cannabis flowers are often prescribed through a telehealth consultation.Credit:Janie Barrett Surfing used to leave former rugby league player Andrew Johns feeling like the tin man from The Wizard of Oz. Injuries from his footy days left him unable to run for the best part of 10 years. Sleep eluded him, too. “My pain in my neck would drive me crazy, I’d be so locked up and stiff,” he says. Now he can run around the park and kick a football with his son. He gets eight to nine hours of sleep a night. “I’m back exercising,” he tells The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. “I’m living.” Since he began using an oil product 18 months ago, Johns says he has “hardly had an inflammatory”. Other former footballers are using it too. “One in his 60s, a well-known guy, who’s had a lot of arthritic problems, said, ‘mate, I’m back walking’.” ‘I’m back walking’: Rugby league Immortal Andrew Johns credits medicinal marijuana with his recovery from injuries.Credit:NRL Photos Sydney-based 24-year-old Ash Richardson uses it in flower form – she vapes it – to help her post-traumatic stress disorder. “You don’t get high, you get normal,” she says. “I am able to get out of bed, run an organisation, leave my house.” Obtaining a prescription for medicinal cannabis is easy. I know because I got one. At 10am one Tuesday, I did an internet search for “authorised cannabis prescribers in Sydney”. Four hours later, I was in a consultation room talking about whether I should use it for insomnia. The doctor was thorough. He required my medical history. We discussed alternatives at length, which I’d already tried. We also discussed risks; for me, being picked up in a random drug driving test was chief among them. There is no legal exemption for cannabis, as there is for other medication. Ash Richardson uses cannabis to combat the effects of PTSD and insomnia.Credit:Janie Barrett He also talked me through the dizzying array of products on the market, mostly in oil or flower form, and told me that if I had been under 25, he would not have given me a prescription due to concerns that young brains are still developing. I signed a declaration that I had been informed of the risks. Then he gave me a prescription for an oil containing equal but low amounts of cannabidiol, or CBD, which does not cause a high, and tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, which does. A balance of the two - which flower products can’t achieve - reduces the effect of THC. As a so-called authorised prescriber, his scripts do not need to go through the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) as other doctors’ do (there were 430 like him nationwide at the end of last year). I went to the Cannatrek website, uploaded the documents, and paid $90 for 30ml over the phone. It arrived a few days later. A colleague, also struggling with his sleep, was inspired to try, too. He went through an online clinic that specialises in cannabis prescriptions, with around-the-clock access to a GP via a toll-free number. He was told that if he got a prescription, the clinic could also fill it, or he could find his own chemist. Over a phone call, he discussed his symptoms with a doctor, who prescribed THC oil. He used the in-house chemist. He was not required to provide a medical history; all the information he gave was voluntary. The all-THC product arrived within three days. He didn’t have to leave his house. My experience was gold standard. My colleague’s wasn’t. Experiences such as his have raised concerns that obtaining prescriptions for medicinal cannabis can be too easy. Lucy Haslam and her husband, a former drug squad officer, became advocates for medicinal cannabis after watching it help their son during his cancer treatment. But she fears patients are not getting “the best level of care” under the online clinic model. “I’ve heard of patients that have gone to clinics and walked away with six or seven or eight products after very little clinical evaluation,” she says. “They’ve spent more money than they’ve needed to, they’ve been prescribed things they don’t need, and it’s cost them a small fortune.” Medicinal marijuana campaigner Lucy Haslam.Credit:Peter Rae There are also concerns some clinics have a profit motive; because they also have a pharmacy licence, they claim the doctor’s consult fee and the chemist’s mark-up on the product. Some doctors prescribe products in which the clinic they work for has a financial interest. Source: FreshLeaf analytics, TGA “[A system in which clinics] have a vested commercial interest in a product they’re prescribing is going to be fraught with danger,” Haslam says. “That gives the industry a bad reputation, particularly when you’re trying to get conservative medical practitioners on board. They think it’s just a bunch of cowboys, and are reluctant to get involved.” A medical specialist, speaking on condition of anonymity, says, “if you are feeling lethargic you don’t go to a thyroid dispensary clinic, you go to your GP. Not everyone needs medical cannabis - 50 per cent of people should be told they don’t need it. That is not happening.” In a statement, the TGA said it had not turned down a prescription application since August 2020. Between 2015 and 2020, seven were refused. There is no data on how many doctors refused to write scripts. ""Medico-legal responsibility for prescribing an unapproved product rests with the prescriber,"" it said. Iain McGregor, the academic director of Sydney University’s Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics, says most clinics are doing a good job, but there are pockets of inappropriate prescribing. “The [TGA] doesn’t quite have the mechanisms in place to deal with that,” he says. “I don’t think we’re at the point where we need to shut the system down because of unscrupulous individuals, but there are legitimate concerns about what’s going on.” The first company to start producing cannabis oil will have an advantage in the highly lucrative market. Credit:Janie Barrett The lack of medical rigour among some clinics is also fuelling suspicions that recreational users are now obtaining their cannabis through doctors. The rise in popularity of flower products backs the theory. While oil products can have equal mixes of THC and CBD, which balances the intoxicating effect of THC – allowing users to, as one doctor put it, “hold down a job and look after kids” – flower products have a ratio of about five parts THC to one of CBD. In mid-September, ASX-listed cannabis producer Althea said dried flower was the fastest-growing category in the country and now made up half the market. “The dried flower market is primarily [driven] by highly-concentrated THC product,” it said in a statement to the stock exchange. A report from FreshLeaf analytics found that by the third quarter of 2021, medicinal flower was cheaper per gram than so-called “green market” flower. In an interview with Cannabiz magazine, Byron Bay doctor Jamie Rickcord said the word was out “that medical stuff is far superior and many people want access to it. They are using a medical condition to get legal access to the best flower they have ever seen. “People say I want to try the Blueberry Haze or the Purple Haze or whatever and I’m like, bollocks, this isn’t Amsterdam, mate ... THC is an amazing compound and a fabulous medicine, but it’s not there to get us all stoned.” Some argue chasing prescriptions for recreational use undermines the medical legitimacy of the drug. It’s not what the TGA had in mind when, back in 2016, it created a system under which it would approve applications from doctors. But others say it’s not a bad thing; at least these users, who may have been self-medicating conditions such as anxiety with illegal products, have some kind of medical oversight. “You have people getting a quality-assured product, they’re getting secured supply, although some of the consultations may not be great, and they’re at least seeing a medical health professional,” says McGregor. On Tuesday, the TGA issued 73 infringement notices worth almost $1 million to three medical cannabis companies, including Cannatrek, for promoting prescription-only products. Some of the advertising also allegedly referred to the treatment of serious illnesses and implied that particular products were recommended by a government authority. Cannabis is placed inside a vape.Credit:Janie Barrett Ash Richardson, who runs pro-legalisation lobby group Green Revolution Australia, suffered abuse as a child, and used to self-medicate with cannabis before she sought out a prescription for the medical version in 2020 for her PTSD (it’s also used by war veterans with the same condition). She vapes the Sativa species, “the less couch-cooked kind”, in the morning, and the Indica species at night. “I was having really severe flashbacks and panic attacks for a long time before I started using medical cannabis,” she says. “I haven’t had a panic attack in about seven months. It certainly helps with anxiety.” The Age and Herald spoke to many people about their cannabis use; Richardson and Johns were the only ones willing to speak on the record, although the late Olivia Newton-John, who used it for cancer, and basketballer Lauren Jackson, who used it for pain management, have also been open about it. “In this society, it’s still people being scared of the repercussions of their job, their family, the driving laws,” Richardson says. The containers dried buds are stored in.Credit:Janie Barrett Medical cannabis is what’s known as an unregistered medicine, which means that, despite the many users who swear by its benefits, its efficacy has not been proven through robust medical tests. There are a few reasons for the rapid growth in cannabis prescriptions from 2020, but the biggest one is the telehealth revolution driven by COVID-19. Previously, people had gone to GPs, most of whom didn’t know much about it or didn’t trust it as a drug. “Telehealth allowed people to find a prescriber who is motivated to consider medical cannabis,” says Rhys Cohen, an industry expert, speaking on behalf of Medicinal Cannabis Industry Australia. “It’s easier to do that by Googling ‘cannabis doctor’ rather than cycling through various GPs in the community.” It’s expensive, but the costs are slowly falling. A FreshLeaf Analytics report found the average monthly spend by patients has fallen from more than $400 a month in the first quarter of 2020 to $278 a month in the third quarter of 2021, even as the average dose increased. There’s no Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme subsidy for the vast majority of its uses, but there is for multiple sclerosis and for a form of paediatric epilepsy; the Department of Veterans Affairs will also subsidise it for pain, and some private health insurers give rebates. Technically, products with low doses of cannabinoid oil can now be sold in Australian pharmacies but there are still none available on shelves because, unlike vitamin products, the manufacturer must supply robust evidence that it works. It’s more expensive than other drugs, yet the rules around growing and manufacturing are so stringent that most of the growers and manufacturers that have sprung up in Australia are yet to make a profit. Imports are cheaper. Share prices are tanking. “You’ve got a bizarre situation in which you can grow opium poppies behind a farm fence, but if you grow cannabis you need [secure] facilities and dogs,” says McGregor. “Perhaps in retrospect it was a bit too demanding, the restrictions on cultivation. If they could grow a crop the way they could soybeans or maze, it might make the industry more financially viable.” Next year, new laws will require imported products to meet the same manufacturing standards as local ones, which the industry hopes will create a level playing field for local products, even though questions remain about how the laws will be policed. Despite Harmer’s reservations about the industry, she still believes in the product. “People are sticking with it despite the high costs, you don’t do that if it’s not working,” she says. “More and more doctors are becoming strong advocates.” Pain specialist Professor Marc Russo is a convert. He saw the benefits for people with neuropathic pain (caused by nerve damage). “I wasn’t able to ignore the evidence in front of my eyes on these patients,” he says. While it does not seem to diminish the pain much, Russo says it helps their sleep and “also appears to decrease patient distress whilst leaving them quite clear-headed and cognitively intact”. Unless Australia legalises recreational use, the key to the future of a viable, respected medicinal cannabis industry is research. Only hard evidence will win over cautious general practitioners and get CBD oil onto chemists’ shelves. Much of the research is coming out of the Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics at the University of Sydney. Dozens of trials have begun since 2016, including high doses of cannabidiol for spinal cord injury pain, if cannabis can ease anxiety linked to anorexia, and how different combinations help sleep. The Lambert Initiative is also investigating the effectiveness of some other compounds found in the cannabis plant, such as cannabinol or CBN, a form of non-intoxicating aged THC, for sleep, and cannabigerol (CBG), derived from younger plants, for osteoarthritis. It’s in the industry’s interest to participate in research, where it can afford to. However, if cannabis becomes legal, that interest could fade. “What you’ve seen in Canada since 2018, when they legalised recreational use, is that a lot of the companies just exited [research and development],” says McGregor. “We have to be careful about that.” The legalisation in Canada has also led to about $CAD15 billion ($16.8 billion) worth of taxes. My bottle of cannabis oil sat locked in the medicine cabinet until I was game to try it. One night when I had no need to drive the next day and no responsibility for children, I measured 2ml in a dropper and tasted that distinctive flavour under my tongue. There was no intoxication. I slept beautifully for half the night then woke up at 4am unable to get back to sleep. On a few more occasions, the same thing happened. Medical cannabis dosing is an inexact science; as the doctor warned me, it takes a while to work out what works. For me, messing about with dosage was not worth the potential downsides, such as putting my driver’s licence at risk. I’ll wait for a while, perhaps for a time which Cohen hopes is not too far away, when medical cannabis is accepted to the level that it is boring and “there are evidence-based medicines that are registered, that are proven, and doctors can consider them like any other medicine”.

50,Victoria and Queensland announce medicinal marijuana trials,,"States join NSW in decriminalising cannabis oil for the treatment of chemotherapy-related nausea and severe epilepsy as well as in palliative care Victoria and Queensland have joined New South Wales in taking part in a clinical trial for the use of medicinal marijuana. The three largest eastern states will decriminalise the use of cannabis oil for the treatment of conditions like chemotherapy-related nausea, drug-resistant severe epilepsy and in palliative care. New South Wales announced that it would hold clinical trials for the substance in December last year, and the premiers of Queensland and Victoria said they had decided to hold similar trials after a meeting in the lead up to Friday’s Council of Australian Governments (Coag) meeting. “Prior to the Coag meeting I was fortunate enough to have a conversation with [NSW] premier Mike Baird and [Victorian] premier Daniel Andrews. I would like to place on the record my thanks to premier Mike Baird for his leadership in relation to this issue,” Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told reporters on Sunday. “I could not let Queensland sit back and watch. I could not let Queensland just be an observer at the trials.” Queensland’s health minister, Cameron Dick, said the state would aim to have the clinical work done on starting a trial by the end of the year. “I’m hoping we can do it as quickly as possible, but we want to do it right,” he said. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said he had seen “first-hand” the relief medicinal cannabis could give children with life-threatening illnesses. Victorian families with children suffering conditions like epilepsy and cancer have long been lobbying the government for the drug to be used medically, saying it has successfully treated their chronically ill children when other medicines have not. “We’ve asked the Law Reform Commission for its advice on how the law can be changed so that families don’t have to make this difficult choice,” Andrews said. “Victorians will now be able to participate in important clinical trials that could change their lives and the lives of families everywhere.” President of the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation, Dr Alex Wodak, said while he was pleased the clinical studies were being done, they should have been carried out a long time ago. He also said there was enough evidence already to be allowing medicinal cannabis use among four key groups of patients; cancer patients suffering extreme nausea and vomiting where other treatments to stop those side effects had been unsuccessful, those with chronic and severe pain, particularly as a result of nerve damage, those with severe weight loss and lack of appetite through HIV or cancer, and those suffering from muscle spasticity due to multiple sclerosis and for whom treatments to prevent this had not worked. “The highest priority for me is getting the medicinal cannabis to those who need it right now,” he said. “I think the use of medicinal cannabis in children is an area that should be studied further, and I take the view that if we treat cannabis as a medicine, and I think it should be, then it should be studied carefully and we should be able to show it does more good than harm.” The Western Australian government said it would not follow the eastern states in holding a trial for medicinal marijuana. “There’s no point all states doing the same sorts of trials at the same time, so WA is waiting on the results of the NSW trials as agreed last year,” the WA health minister, Kim Hames, said. “If other states want to do their own trials, that’s fine.” “WA has offered our support to other states and we are keen to see the outcomes of the research being undertaken,” he said. The WA opposition leader, Mark McGowan, told the state branch’s annual conference in July that WA Labor would legalise the use of medical marijuana if elected. The federal health minister, Sussan Ley, said that the Commonwealth had a role in the largely state-based regulation surrounding medical marijuana, through the Therapeutic Goods Administration which authorises medicines and medical equipment. “We will watch with interest as these trials develop and we will take the necessary regulatory steps from a commonwealth level when the time comes,” Ley said. A Senate committee looking at the federal regulation of medical cannabis will report its findings in May.",7,725
51,"Medicinal cannabis legalised in Victoria, child epilepsy patients to be given access from 2017",Tue 12 Apr 2016 at 9:23am," Medicinal cannabis legalised in Victoria, child epilepsy patients to be given access from 2017 Victoria has become the first state in Australia to legalise the use of medicinal cannabis. Children with severe epilepsy will be the first to access to the drug in 2017, Victoria's Health Minister Jill Hennessy said, after the Access to Medicinal Cannabis Bill passed Parliament. The legislation enables the manufacture, supply and access to medicinal cannabis products in the state. ""We're starting with these children with severe epilepsy, whose lives have been shown to improve so significantly, because we know these children often don't make it until adulthood,"" Ms Hennessy said.  ""We want to improve the quality of their life."" She said it also meant parents of children with the disorder have to purchase the drug illegally. ""I just think that in this day and age, it's unfair and unacceptable to ask a parent to make a decision between obeying the law and acting in the best interests of their child,"" she said.  ""Those parents will no longer have that dilemma."" Ms Hennessy has said access to the drug — available in a variety of forms, including tinctures, oils, capsules, sprays and vaporisable liquids — would be rolled out gradually and eventually be made available to palliative care and those with HIV. The Government said it would set up an Office of Medicinal Cannabis to oversee the manufacture of the drugs and would educate doctors and patients about their role and eligibility for the scheme. An independent body will also provide advice on the introduction of the drug, which is also legal in more than 20 states in the United States, Spain and Israel. Legislation to allow the cultivation of cannabis in Australia for medical or scientific purposes passed Federal Parliament in February. The Victorian Government will undertaking a small-scale, strictly controlled cannabis cultivation trial at a Victorian research facility. The Queensland Government last year announced that a trial to treat children with epilepsy with medicinal cannabis would take place this year. New South Wales Premier Mike Baird this year announced 330 patients suffering nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy would take part in a clinical trial using a cannabis-derived tablet manufactured by a Canadian company. The medicinal cannabis trial is the third of its kind in NSW after trials involving terminally ill patients and children with severe epilepsy.

52,"Medicinal cannabis product CBD does not affect driving ability, research finds","May 31, 2022 — 6.00am","We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 10 months ago New research has confirmed taking even very high levels of cannabidiol (CBD), a medicinal product derived from cannabis, has no impact on people’s ability to drive. Researchers from the University of Sydney have conducted a study of the impact of CBD on people’s cognitive ability, specifically whether it affects people’s ability to drive in the same way other medicines can. New research confirms cannabidiol (CBD) does not impair people’s ability to drive even at high doses.Credit:iStock  Lead research author Dr Danielle McCartney said on every measure they could not find any effect of CBD on a person’s ability to operate a vehicle. “The finding speaks for itself somewhat, we didn’t find any effect on driving performance or cognitive function,” she said. “We assessed a few different aspects of cognitive function, and when people reported subjectively how they felt, they didn’t report any signs or symptoms of intoxication,” she said. The study featured 17 participants who were given either a placebo or 15 milligrams, 300 milligrams or 1500 milligrams of CBD (the maximum daily dose currently permitted). No adverse cognitive effects were found from any level of the drug, with the tests including practical testing as well as self-reporting of any effects. Participants undertook simulated driving exercises between 45-75 minutes after taking their assigned treatment, and then again at between 3.5 and four hours after. CBD is becoming increasingly used around the world including in Australia for a range of conditions, from epilepsy and chronic pain to sleep disorders and anxiety conditions. Previous University of Sydney research found 55,000 requests to access medicinal CBD have been approved in Australia since 2016. CBD is a separate chemical from THC, which is the compound in cannabis which gets you “high” when used recreationally, and which does cause impairment to cognitive and driving ability. Some medicinal cannabis products contain both CBD and THC, and are referred to as nabiximols, and are available to be prescribed in Australia, but at a higher drug classification than medicines which only contain CBD. Police also conduct roadside drug tests which include tests for cannabis, although those tests specifically test for THC rather than CBD. McCartney said they did conduct some research into whether the CBD medicines produced positive results on two of the most common tests used by police in NSW, and found that they did not. “We didn’t observe any false positive tests, so if people are taking CBD medication, they can be fairly confident that they will not impair their driving and they will not test positive for cannabis,” she said. McCartney did sound a note of caution about the findings, stressing that they only looked at the effect of CBD on driving ability in isolation, and did not look at how it might interact with other medications. “At the moment there are a number of drugs which are impairing which people are legally allowed to take and still drive, like opioids and benzodiazepines,” she said. “CBD could interact with these substances, but whether it exacerbates their effects or has a different effect is something which needs more research to determine.” The research has been published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology.

53,WA researchers look at potential to use medicinal cannabis for weight loss,Mon 14 Feb 2022 at 10:52pm," WA researchers look at potential to use medicinal cannabis for weight loss To a layperson, it may seem counterintuitive that a plant with a reputation for giving people the ""munchies"" would be used to facilitate weight loss. But in recent years, scientific communities around the world are focusing more attention toward the therapeutic benefits of cannabis, including the potential for the plant to be used to treat obesity. Researchers at Curtin University in Western Australia have teamed up with local medical cannabis producer, Little Green Pharma, to investigate the possible application of the plant as an aid for weight loss. Lead researcher and Professor of Metabolism, Marco Falasca, said the research had the potential to deliver a safer alternative to currently available weight-loss drugs. ""There are not many treatments for obesity, and they all come with side effects,"" Professor Falasca said. ""Compounds present in our body control satiety and all the mechanisms related to obesity."" ""We need to use the same mechanisms as nature — this way, we believe we'll have fewer side effects."" Professor Falasca acknowledged that, due to negative preconceptions of the cannabis plant, there was still some hesitation from doctors in prescribing medicinal cannabis to patients. ""It's important to overcome the problem we have with the stigma around cannabinoid research,"" Professor Falasca said. ""The best way forward is to provide scientific evidence that these treatments are working — to give scientific dignity to what we are doing."" Leon Warne, Head of Research and Innovation at Little Green Pharma, echoed these sentiments but added attitudes were already changing. ""I think there's certainly a growing wave of doctors who are seeing ... the areas where this drug can effectively be used to improve the quality of life of many patients,"" Dr Warne said. Dr Warne explained cannabinoid function was quite complicated and human bodies had a natural cannabinoid system, similar to that found in cannabis plants. To illustrate how this works in medicine, he used the analogy of a lock and key, where the body's receptors acted as the lock, whilst the cannabis plant compound functioned as the key. ""When the [plant cannabinoids] engage with that lock, they unearth the natural cannabinoids within the body to have these effects that we are seeing."" Medicinal cannabis has been legal in Australia for six years but is very strictly regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration — something Dr Warne believes is a good thing for both patients and research. ""[Due to the] tough regulatory stance of the TGA around ensuring the safety, efficacy and quality standards of medicinal cannabis products, the standard of the medicines we are producing are extremely high,"" he said. ""Whilst we might think that places like North America might be more liberal with their approaches towards cannabis, the quality of the medicine is not at the same standards."" ""We have this really great opportunity here in Australia to conduct high-quality research."" Joe Kosterich, a Perth-based GP and medical adviser to Little Green Pharma, said the validity of the studies being conducted were supported by other international data. ""This is highly early experimental work so it can't be prescribed on that basis, but the research that's going to be undertaken in Perth builds on some of this experimental data,"" Dr Kosterich said. ""It's really going to look to see whether, out in the real world, this can be a usage [of the cannabis plant]."" ""I don't think we can pre-empt or pre-judge ... that's why you do the research — to find out,"" he said.

54,Epileptic children to be first in Queensland treated with medicinal cannabis as part of trial,Wed 21 Oct 2015 at 7:08am," Epileptic children to be first in Queensland treated with medicinal cannabis as part of trial Children with severe drug-resistant epilepsy will be the first in Queensland to be treated with medicinal cannabis. Health Minister Cameron Dick revealed on Wednesday that the trial is likely to occur at Brisbane's Lady Cilento Children's Hospital in 2016. In a letter tabled in Parliament, Mr Dick said Queensland planned to partner in an interstate clinical trial. ""[It is] an opportunity to show medicinal cannabis can be a safe and effective addition to existing treatments,"" he wrote in the letter. ""As more information becomes available, I will be better placed to consider what is in the best interests of all Queenslanders, including the need for legislative change."" Australian Medical Association Queensland president Dr Chris Zappala welcomed the trial and said it must be rigorous. ""It's important we proceed cautiously and carefully to begin with and that means appropriately constructing the trials and putting the appropriate safeguards in place,"" he said. [It is] an opportunity to show medicinal cannabis can be a safe and effective addition to existing treatments. ""For example medicinal marijuana needs to be provided on a script, under medical supervision [and] appropriately dispensed."" Dr Zappala said there were still questions about the benefits of medicinal cannabis. ""What dose works best?"" he asked. ""Where the potential risks might lie, particularly in terms of long-term risks? ""We don't have that long-term data and we do know that there are risks associated with marijuana."" He said some doctors were uneasy about the potential risks. ""If there's a benefit I think you'll find that everyone's in favour of that,"" he said. ""Let's get the trials done and it might need to be more than one. ""Evidence is increasing, it's promising, but it hasn't reached that threshold yet where we can make general recommendations to patients around using these products."" Mr Dick revealed details of the trial in response to an e-petition signed by 1,474 people, calling on the Government to make provisions for patients and carers to lawfully cultivate and produce their own cannabis and oils. The Federal Government announced on Saturday plans to legalise the growing of cannabis for medical purposes.

55,Medicinal marijuana to become legal to grow in Australia — but how will it work?,Fri 28 Oct 2016 at 9:28pm," Medicinal marijuana to become legal to grow in Australia — but how will it work? It is about to become legal to cultivate and manufacture medicinal cannabis in Australia, which means people will be able to apply for a licence to grow their own cannabis crop.  Another change coming into effect in early November through the Therapeutic Goods Administration will mean medicinal cannabis will no longer fall under Australia's most stringent of schedules, reserved for dangerous drugs. Instead, there will be provisions in place to use it on medical grounds, with certain approvals but only for very ill people.  However, it will still be illegal to use or grow marijuana for recreational purposes.  It will remain up to the states to decide whether the drug will be allowed and who will be able to use it, dispense it, who will be able to approve it, and what dosage and form of medicinal cannabis is appropriate.  And this is where things get murky, because each state is now trying to form or introduce its own legislation, while also considering an international law known as the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961.  The law is set in place by the United Nations, and outlines how medicinal cannabis should be approached.  There is also a lack of good quality information about medicinal cannabis, because it has been illegal for so long.  This means that it has not gone through the stringent clinical trials other medications typically go through, and there is little literature about the forms of medicinal cannabis, dosage, side effects, and benefits.  If you are in Queensland, from March 2017 a specialist should be able to prescribe medicinal cannabis for certain patients who have illnesses including MS, epilepsy, cancer and HIV/AIDS.  There are no age restrictions, but approval will only be provided by a doctor who needs to show evidence that medicinal cannabis could help the patient.  In New South Wales, medicinal cannabis will be available for end of life illnesses, but only for adults.  In Victoria, children with severe epilepsy will be able to access medicinal cannabis from early 2017.  The ACT is currently working on legislation that will include education sources for doctors. The legislation is expected to come into effect next year . Tasmania is developing a Controlled Access Scheme, to allow patients to access unregistered medical cannabis. It is expected to come into effect next year.  The WA Government has just passed changes supporting the federal legislation. That means that, from Tuesday, doctors will be able to prescribe medicinal cannabis under strict conditions.  Products will only be able to be dispensed by a pharmacist. However, there is still no legal product available in Australia.  There is no information available for what the situation in South Australia or the Northern Territory. While patients who have been illegally using medicinal cannabis are applauding the changes, they fear it could be a decade before it is widely available to those who need it.  Ben Oakley, from Wollongong, is among those who will be waiting a while to gain access to medicinal marijuana legally.  The 21-year-old has a rare condition called stiff person's syndrome, and has been using cannabis oil purchased on the black market to treat his chronic and debilitating symptoms. ""There are times where I've got so much tightness and tension in my back that it's just excruciatingly painful,"" he said. ""And the pharmaceutical medications don't always help to relieve that. But medicinal cannabis does. It relieves a lot of the pain and it allows me to continue moving on."" Mr Oakley explained that despite people often assuming he was sitting around ""smoking and getting high"", the way the oil worked he had never experienced the typical effects of recreational marijuana. ""I've never been high, never had the munchies. All it's given me is positive beneficial relief and that's something that people still to this day don't understand."" Mr Oakley said he sourced his medicinal cannabis from interstate, but that it was difficult as he had to acquire it through the black market. ""But the person who has been supplying me is an angel, they've been supplying over 200 people nationwide with medicinal cannabis free, all off her own back,"" he said.  ""This person is a pensioner and she's just incredible. She's given me more life than what the doctors have."" Despite the legislation being passed, it will still take a long time before people like Mr Oakley can obtain the drugs legally. He said he was worried that there had not been enough of an educational campaign to accompany the legalisation, to help medical professionals understand what it would mean and what their options were. ""I've spoken to my GP and a few specialists and they don't know where they're going, they don't know what they're doing,"" Mr Oakley said. ""Most of them have said 'look, what the government have set up right now is not good enough and a lot of them have gone, well it's not worth our time to go into this.'  ""There's not enough information."" We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

56,Pharmaceutical-grade medicinal cannabis 'global shortage' to be met with Australian product,Sun 23 Jun 2019 at 3:25am," Pharmaceutical-grade medicinal cannabis 'global shortage' to be met with Australian product An Australian medicinal cannabis company is working to address a global shortage of pharmaceutical-grade product, reducing cost and improving access at the same time. The federal Therapeutic Goods Administration's Special Access Scheme, which authorises approved doctors to prescribe medicinal cannabis on a patient by patient basis, has been operational for just over two years in which time Australian demand has continued to grow. More than 3,100 scripts had been approved by the TGA from March 2018 to January this year but the industry has claimed that number has since risen to just under 9,000. Associate professor Dr Vicki Kotsirilos from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners — the first authorised GP prescriber of medicinal cannabis in Australia — said national demand for medicinal cannabis was currently almost entirely supported by imported product. ""The earlier products have been imported products because these products were being used widely overseas before Australia,"" she said. Christian Read insists while medical medicinal cannabis can't cure him of the pain he experiences, it grants him some relief. Publicly listed Australian company THC Global is aiming to change that after it was this month granted a licence by the TGA to produce pharmaceutical grade cannabis at a property in Bundaberg, Queensland. Group Chief Executive Ken Charteris said Bundaberg was the perfect environment to commence production. ""We've now got the complete suite of licences that includes growing and development of plants all the way through to an active medicine for the Australian market initially and obviously to export,"" he said. ""Right now there's a shortage globally for pharmaceutical GMP produced product. ""We're really at the forefront with the capacity growing plants here to meet the shortage and forecast shortage for the next several years of high-grade, good manufacturing practices"". The industry has claimed Australian Government figures suggested there were at least 200,000 patients who should be eligible for high-grade medicinal cannabis products. Mr Charteris said Australian demand had started to catch up to that seen on the international scale. ""Canada now has over 350,000 patients, Israel is in excess of 35,000 patients for a population of eight million,"" he said. ""The numbers for Germany and Europe are in the millions. Here in Australia it's developing really rapidly"". He said there had already been international interest in the unique breed being grown in the region. ""We're totally geared up to meet export needs globally because we are doing good manufacturing practices certified product and that will be going to various parts of the world including Europe and ASEAN nations,"" he said. The company's manager of cannabis strain development and agronomy John Hall said the Bundaberg crops had been bred to have higher levels of cannabidiol (CBD) which had no psychoactive properties. ""It's technically an industrial hemp plant still because their THC is below 1 per cent but we've been able to quadruple the CBD content,"" he said. ""We will extract the CBD and produce an oil with all of the CDB and with a very small amount of THC"". Dr Kotsirilos said the increase in production would mean Australian-produced medicinal cannabis would become more affordable. ""At the moment the imported medicinal cannabis products prices tend to vary but on average they are about $300 to $350 per bottle which could last for about a month,"" she said. ""My understanding from the current Australian product is they're available at $200 a bottle which is much more affordable"".  Chief executive Ken Charteris said the Bundaberg facility, which will form part of a larger operation, would also include an extraction facility. ""This site alone will go up by at least five to eight people in agriculture, extraction will probably go up by three or four,"" he said. ""When all our facilities come up and running (including Southport and Ballina) we'll have in excess of  300 employees spread throughout Australia"".  Although demand for the product has grown Dr Kotsirilos said it was only prescribed once alternatives were exhausted. The Federal Government has approved the sale of medicinal marijuana, but it still won't be easy for people to get a prescription. ""It's not always the wonder drug. People often think it's the wonder drug but it doesn't always eradicate pain and in rare cases we do see side effects,"" she said. ""Once we have decided the need for the trial then we go ahead and apply for a permit where the form goes to the TGA and State Department of Health. It usually takes about 48 hours for a permit.  ""There is some evidence but the evidence is not strong and we need more research"". Mr Charteris said the granting of the licence was the first step to facilitating more scientific research. ""Us getting up to this level will increase the level of available research. At the moment the material is be pretty restricted, there's not a lot out there,"" he said. 'We'll be producing oils initially and then capsules and all the other methods of applying medication, but a full production facility will now give access to a lot more scientific research"".

57,"Vanuatu set to enter global cannabis market after passing cultivation, export laws – but some remain sceptical",Wed 22 Feb 2023 at 7:21pm," Vanuatu set to enter global cannabis market after passing cultivation, export laws – but some remain sceptical Vanuatu has become one of the first Pacific countries to allow businesses to grow medicinal cannabis and hemp, after signing into law policies governing the import, cultivation and manufacture of the plant.  It paves the way for the country to enter the global cannabis market, with some hoping the plant can become a major cash-crop for local communities. The government has made at least five 10-year licenses available for businesses to purchase – two for growing medicinal cannabis and three for hemp production – for 10 million Vatu each ($123,000). Businesses are also expected to pay an additional 10 million Vatu every year as a license renewal fee. Medicinal cannabis is most often used to relieve chronic pain and has also been used to treat anxiety, cancer-related symptoms, epilepsy, insomnia and multiple sclerosis (MS). Hemp typically has less of the psychoactive compound tetrahydrocannabinol, and can be used in products including rope, textiles, clothing, shoes, food, paper, bioplastics, insulation, and biofuel. The director-general of Vanuatu's Agricultural Department, Moses Amos, told local broadcaster VBTC the policies aimed to encourage foreign investment in the country. ""The government is especially focused on alternative resources that we can use, and one of them is industrial hemp and medicinal cannabis,"" he said. ""It's a potential resource that we can use and develop to become a potential export commodity for us, and at the same time bring a little money into the country."" In an attempt to mitigate the ""high risks"" associated with the cannabis industry, the government has said it will only approve licenses for companies with at least 10 years' experience in the field. Advocates say medicinal cannabis offers effective relief when other treatments are failing. But Australian guidelines say there's limited evidence to support its use. That would mean only foreign businesses from countries with long-standing marijuana industries like the US would be eligible. But the move remains controversial in Vanuatu, where recreational use of the drug has a huge social stigma and remains illegal. Former police officer Isso Kapum says he used to ""chase criminals"" who smoked or sold marijuana illegally. But today he is hoping for a license to grow cannabis on his southern island, Tanna, believing it will bring development and riches to Vanuatu's people. ""I did find out that it is very, very valuable to the islands of the Southern Hemisphere,"" he said. ""On the island, we really have to identify a product that has demand and a product that has value and a product to sustain the people."" Mr Kapum said a chance encounter with Australian resort owner Andrew Smith first sparked his interest in hemp and cannabis farming. Together, they founded Tafea Industries, a cannabis and hemp company with plans to begin the first commercial marijuana plantation on Tanna if they gain the government's approval. Mr Smith said the pair was almost driven out of the village when they first proposed the business idea.  ""The reactions just by some were quite harsh,"" he said. ""But it was nothing more than opening minds and showing opportunities."" ""Once we started to break it down a little bit, they started to see the opportunity of farming, the opportunity of aftermarket products."" He says Tafea Industries now has the support of tribal chiefs around the island, who have also become shareholders in the cannabis company, and believes the release of cannabis and hemp licenses marks an ""exciting"" moment for Vanuatu. Until recently, Vanuatu – like other Pacific countries – had criminalised the cultivation of cannabis. But in 2018, the government became involved with a US-based medicinal cannabis company, Phoenix Life Sciences, headed by Australian Martin Tindall, which rapidly changed the country's relationship with the controlled substance. A US company moves to trial a new cannabis drug on diabetics in Vanuatu as a result of stringent Federal laws at home. Phoenix Life made plans to test its cannabis-derived medication on diabetes patients across the country, and it struck a non-binding agreement with the government to use its products to treat cancer in hospitals. Soon after, the government looked to amend its Dangerous Drugs Act to allow the commercial cultivation of cannabis – changes that were signed into law in 2021. Mr Tindall, however, was arrested for securities fraud in the US in 2019, halting his company's initial plans – though the ABC understands he still wishes to return to the medicinal cannabis business in Vanuatu, after he pled guilty to one count and was released from jail. Vanuatu's current government has distanced itself from Phoenix Life Sciences. Mr Amos, from the Agricultural Department, said the current legislation was ""not really"" influenced by the company. ""The act was mainly driven mainly by our technicians here in Vanuatu,"" he said. ""This Phoenix company operated outside the scope of the current legislation."" Despite government assurances, some people in Vanuatu are sceptical about the country's entry into the cannabis and hemp industries. Sam Naiu, the Tafea provincial Agricultural Officer from Tanna, said while the country stood to benefit financially, he feared people would abuse the drug. ""On the social side, I think it's a dangerous decision that the government has made,"" Mr Naiu said. ""When we're asleep in the night, someone can sneak through the fence and steal the marijuana."" He suggests the government should introduce the product in remote areas first, where population is low. ""Don't go to Tanna first, but allow it in a place where it's easier to control, where security is strong and the production is safe."" But Mr Naiu also sees the potential in cannabis production for the people of Tanna. Vanilla and coffee are the primary export crops on the island, but most people earn a modest income through small-scale agriculture and the domestic sale of meat, vegetables and fruit. Mr Naiu admits cannabis could provide another lucrative cash-crop, but he believes there are other ways the government can support local farmers. ""Vanuatu hasn't even exported a local root crop, but now it wants to export something like marijuana that brings risks to this place,"" he said. Other Pacific countries are considering following in Vanuatu's footsteps.  Cook Islands voted to legalise marijuana for medicinal purposes in a 2022 referendum, and a ministerial team has been appointed to look into the issue. In 2014, Guam became the first US territory to allow medicinal marijuana, and in 2019 also legalised the drug for recreational use. But it has taken many years for local cannabis businesses to win approval to farm and manufacture the plant, with the first licenses for production approved only a few months ago. Charlie Hermosa from Bella Wings Aviation in Guam has applied for a license to deliver cannabis using a fleet of drones. He said the new industry can allow Pacific businesses to become global players at the forefront of cannabis production, and stop relying just on tourism dollars. ""I think right now with the way the global economy is kind of working out, we're trying to position ourselves to be able to sustain economic development outside of the normal channels that most islands have,"" he said. ""[We need to be] first to market, creating an environment that says, 'Hey, listen, Guam's got some great cannabis'."" And with more islands entering the cannabis market, Mr Hermosa said there could be an opportunity to create trans-Pacific businesses, including with Vanuatu. ""I would really love to talk to the government down there and see if there's an opportunity.""

58,analysisWho can get medicinal marijuana?,Wed 22 Feb 2017 at 4:05am," Who can get medicinal marijuana? You might be confused by the announcement today that the Federal Government has approved the importation of medicinal marijuana. After all, some patients have already been legally taking the drug, so you'd be forgiven for wondering where they've been getting it from. Doctors have already been importing the drug, but they've been doing it on a patient-by-patient basis. This involves a long process of approvals through the states and the Therapeutic Goods Association, who require paperwork outlining the evidence and potential benefits, and it's also reliant on the availability of the drug overseas. Because of this, some people have had to wait months before they actually receive their treatments. As of now, though, it will be easier to import medicinal marijuana from approved international suppliers, which means the product will be able to be imported in bulk and warehoused in Australia until it's needed. Health Minister Greg Hunt says the importation rules will be relaxed until there's an Australian industry that's up to the task of meeting demand. That could be a while: a law allowing the cultivation of medicinal marijuana in Australia only came into effect in October last year, and the first licence for private cultivation was only issued last week. Federal Government Medicinal cannabis use is still illegal and only available through trials and limited special access schemes. But, earlier this year, the Federal Government passed legislation legalising the cultivation of cannabis for medicinal purposes. Queensland Queensland doctors will soon be able to prescribe it for their patients' treatment. New laws will give certain specialists including oncologists, paediatric neurologists and palliative care specialists the right to prescribe medicinal cannabis from March 2017. Other doctors would be able to apply to Queensland Health for permission to prescribe the drug for patients with certain conditions. Tasmania The State Government announced specialist medical practitioners would be allowed to prescribe the drug to patients suffering serious and chronic illness from 2017. NSW In July, NSW Premier Mike Baird said 40 children in the state with the most severe cases of drug-resistant epilepsy would now have access to a cannabis-based treatment under a compassionate access scheme. NSW is conducting a trial for patients suffering vomiting and nausea as a result of chemotherapy. Western Australia The WA Government previously said it would not conduct medicinal cannabis trials until it received the results of testing in New South Wales. Northern Territory Not legal. South Australia In April, SA Health Minister Jack Snelling ruled out changing the law in South Australia at this stage. Victoria It's legal. It was the first state to pass legislation legalising the use of medicinal cannabis. Yes and no. If you already have approval to use medicinal marijuana, then yes, you'll no longer have to wait for the product you need to be imported, assuming that product is one that has met all of the import regulations. But if you don't already have a prescription, it won't be any easier to get one as a result of this change. Quite hard, because medicinal marijuana isn't approved by the Therapeutic Goods Association (TGA) as a registered good. You need special approval to take it, and the TGA provides two ways for you to go about getting this: In both cases, doctors need to be able to show that the drug would be of benefit for a particular patient with a particular disease, and the application processes are stringent. As well, the use of marijuana for medical purposes still needs to be legal in your state or territory. On that note, individual states and territories also have their own laws regarding access to medicinal marijuana. Individual states and territories can make access available to specific types of patients. For instance, the Victorian Government announced in 2015 that it was legalising access to medicinal cannabis in ""exceptional circumstances"", including cases of children with severe epilepsy. The TGA isn't specific about which illnesses might be eligible for special access, but medicinal marijuana has been used to treat people with epilepsy, chronic pain, cancer and HIV/AIDS. No, it's not. ""In America, you can go to the doctor with a headache and get a prescription for medicinal marijuana,"" said Professor Jennifer Martin, chair of clinical pharmacology at the University of Newcastle. She says she's in favour of Australia's more slow and steady approach to developing knowledge about the safety and efficacy of medicinal marijuana, though she understands that some people are impatient to get access. ""Doctors here don't want pressure to provide scripts yet because we want to make sure it's actually safe and effective first,"" Professor Martin said. On the whole, no. Professor Martin says there is some positive evidence about certain treatments: for instance, for epilepsy. But she says much more research needs to be done to make sure that treatments are a) more effective than alternatives and b) don't have side effects which mean they shouldn't be used.

59,Australia's biggest medicinal marijuana farm to be built in Queensland's conservative garden city,Thu 15 Apr 2021 at 2:23am,"ABC Rural Australia's biggest medicinal marijuana farm to be built in Queensland's conservative garden city Two medicinal marijuana companies have fast-tracked plans to build a large cannabis farm in the conservative heartland of Queensland. Download the ABC News app for all the latest. Construction of the facility on the outskirts of Toowoomba is set to begin within six months and will produce 500 tonnes of marijuana a year with an export value of more than $1 billion. A merger of Australian-owned Australian Natural Therapeutics Group (ANTG) and Canadian-owned Asterion Cannabis Inc has hastened construction plans by up to two years, according to ANTG chief executive Matt Cantelo. ""We see Australia becoming the global leader in medicinal cannabis production,"" Mr Cantelo said. The $400-million facility will focus on the growth, manufacturing and research of medicinal products. Near Toowoomba's Wellcamp Airport, the facility will be able to export products overseas. The Australian Government gave Asterion's facility ""major project status"" in 2019, and the Canadian cannabis company has already gained a medicinal cannabis license, a cannabis research license, and a manufacturing licence from the Australian Office of Drug Control. Stephen Van Deventer, CEO of Asterion, said the merger with ANTG fitted its short and long-term strategies. ""This provides early revenue for Asterion and scalability to ANTG,"" he said. ANTG has an existing supply chain and facility in regional NSW, and access to European export markets. ""It gives the Australian patient market and also the overseas market the ability for accessibility and it gives us the ability to scale up and meet the growing demand for cannabinoid medicines,"" Mr Cantelo said. Earlier this year ANTG signed a $92 million, nine-year deal with German company Cannamedical Pharma to export commercially-grown Australian medical cannabis to Europe. Low-dose medicinal cannabis is now legal to sell in Australia in chemists without a prescription because of new rules introduced by the Therapeutic Goods Administration in February. No product has the regulatory approvals yet, so stock is unlikely to reach pharmacy shelves until at least the second half of this year. At the same time, Mr Cantelo said the TGA's approvals through its special access scheme were on the rise. The scheme allows any GP to apply to TGA to prescribe patients cannabinoid medicines. Last month, there were just under 10,000 approvals under the scheme, compared to 3,926 at the same time last year, according to the Department of Health. ""We're seeing significant 10-20 per cent increases [in demand] month on month,"" Mr Cantelo said. He said ANTG's existing facility in NSW would soon struggle to meet domestic market demand, hence its new interest in a mega farm in Toowoomba. Mr Cantelo said the build would be staged depending on the demand, with the first stage only producing a quarter of the facility's potential. The Toowoomba region is a rich agricultural region, politically conservative community and centre of a safe LNP seat. That has not deterred the community from supporting plans for a local medicinal cannabis industry. ""It has been proven to many people, regardless of their political views, the benefits of medicinal cannabis,"" Toowoomba Regional Council mayor Paul Antonio said. Mr Antonio said the project would be a boon for local businesses and the community was ""delighted"". ""This new investment will be amazing for Toowoomba,"" he said. ""In the next 30 years, we'll have an extra 55,000 residents and there'll be expanding industrial and commercial sectors and new ventures like this in our Toowoomba Trade Gateway will mean a lot."" In full production, the cannabis farm will employ roughly 1,000 staff. Australian company Medibis is also planning to develop a $180-million cannabis facility near Tooowoomba in the future.

60,Three out of five prescriptions for medicinal cannabis are to treat chronic pain,10 Dec 2020,"Growing up, Georgia's family thought she was a bit of a hypochondriac because she'd always complain about weird aches and pains. Even doctors didn't really take her symptoms seriously. ""I remember at 14 going to the doctors with really bad lower back pain, and they told me it was my posture. I was really fatigued all the time and sleeping so much,"" Georgia told Hack. ""Every day waking up, I'm not sure what I'm going to be in for. It's a bit of a Russian roulette."" Finally, after years of pain and other chronic symptoms, Georgia was diagnosed with endometriosis. Endometriosis is a disease in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows in other parts of the body. It can be painful, chronic, and has no cure. Georgia, who now runs the instagram page The Endo Journal, didn't have a whole lot of options for how to manage her symptoms.  Then, last year, Georgia's gynecologist suggested Georgia try medicinal cannabis. Georgia thought getting approved for medicinal cannabis would be really hard, that only people with terminal illnesses or severe conditions could access it. She was pleasantly surprised. ""I got approved straight away. Within 24 hours I'd been approved."" ""My cannabis doctor just sends my prescriptions to my local pharmacy, and then I call up and pay for it and then they let me know when it's arrived. So it's really actually a lot easier than I thought,"" Georgia said. Medicinal cannabis was approved for use in Australia in 2016, and according to the Therapeutic Goods Administration, who run the program, the majority of people who seek medicinal cannabis do so to treat conditions like endometriosis. ""Over 60 per cent of the total applications received were for chronic pain, and this would include those accessing medicinal cannabis specifically for endometriosis or associated reproductive issues,"" a statement by the TGA to Hack said. There have been over 80,000 successful applications for use of medicinal cannabis since the scheme started, and nearly 56,000 of those have been in the last 12 months. The TGA warned that it's really important that people speak to their doctors before accessing the products, because some people have comorbidities that make them unsuitable for it. According to the TGA, there are also now more than 3,000 individual prescribers of medicinal cannabis in Australia. Georgia said authorised prescribers can really help. ""You've got the guidance of how much to take, what different strains to take. If you do experience any side effects they can give you advice on what you should change or different products you could try out,"" she said. ""It's really good having that professional guidance.""

But her condition improved dramatically when she discovered an unlikely treatment - cannabis. Ms Curry is one of an increasing number of patients speaking out about their use of the drug, as state and federal governments move to allow its use in some cases. Ms Curry said the drug had made an enormous difference to her quality of life. ""I have been to the place where this is not worth living, I'm quite happy to end this,"" she said. ""I'm not there now, with this drug ... I am able to sit here and speak with you ... life is worth living.""  Following a decision by the Therapeutic Goods Administration to reschedule cannabis from a prohibited substance to a controlled drug, the ACT Government announced a new medicinal cannabis scheme last week. It will determine guidelines for the prescription, distribution and use of the drug. The move follows action by the Commonwealth on a cultivation scheme earlier this year, and a new compassionate access scheme in New South Wales for child epilepsy patients. ""There comes a time, after all the inquiries and investigations are done ... when a decision must be made,"" ACT Assistant Health Minister Meegan Fitzharris said. ""This framework gives the ACT an opportunity to implement a scheme with clear, regulatory oversight that protects both patients and public health."" Despite the strong endorsement from patients and politicians, the Australian Medical Association's ACT President, Steve Robson, said the issue must be approached carefully.

62,"Study proves medicinal cannabis can help children with severe epilepsy, researchers say",Wed 24 May 2017 at 9:09pm," Study proves medicinal cannabis can help children with severe epilepsy, researchers say Researchers have published what they say is the first scientific evidence that medicinal cannabis helps children with severe epilepsy. Regular doses of medicinal cannabis can reduce seizures in children with severe epilepsy, new research shows. Australian doctors were part of an international trial, testing a component of medicinal cannabis known as cannabidiol in kids with Dravet syndrome. It is a complex disorder where children suffer drug-resistant seizures and a high death rate. One of the authors, University of Melbourne Professor Ingrid Scheffer, welcomed the findings. ""This research is critically important. It's the first scientific evidence that cannabidiol is effective for uncontrolled seizures in Dravet syndrome,"" she said. ""Until now, there has only been anecdotal evidence but now we have scientific evidence proving that medicinal cannabis is definitely effective in severe epilepsy."" The Federal Government has approved the sale of medicinal marijuana, but it still won't be easy for people to get a prescription. In the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, cannabidiol liquid was used to treat the children. It is a natural compound found in cannabis stalks and flowers and does not contain mind altering properties. Patients in the study remained on epilepsy medications as well as taking either the cannabidiol liquid or a placebo. The frequency of seizures was measured over 14 weeks. Of those given medicinal cannabis, more than 40 per cent had their seizures halved. Some of the patients given cannabidiol reported mild to moderate side effects such as diarrhoea, vomiting or fatigue. ""It's not a fix-all but these findings show that cannabinol is as good as some of our best anti-epilepsy medications,"" Professor Scheffer said. Professor Scheffer said other Australian groups were trialling medicinal cannabis, mainly in open-label trials where patients know if they are getting the drug or the placebo. ""We are running another trial in adults with focal epilepsy, using a gel, and the anecdotal response has been very exciting,"" she said. The Federal Government has moved to loosen importation laws on medicinal marijuana, and people who use it say they are cautiously optimistic. Epilepsy Action Australia chief executive Carol Ireland hoped the research would prompt authorities to fast-track processes to make cannabis more available. ""Some families I think will feel heartened by this. It's the proof of what they already knew,"" she said. But she said other families may feel afraid because ""they still can't, for the most part, get access to a legal product right now"". Ms Ireland said several issues needed to be addressed for families seeking medicinal cannabis, including better access to the drug, price and finding a physician to prescribe it.

63,"Medical cannabis in Australia 'pretty much inaccessible', leaving patients looking to US",Mon 23 Jul 2018 at 9:23am," Medical cannabis in Australia 'pretty much inaccessible', leaving patients looking to US A father who escaped jail time for juicing cannabis to treat his two daughters is now considering sending one of them overseas for treatment. Stephen Taylor's daughters, Morgan, 21, and Ariel, 25, suffer from Crohn's disease, a debilitating bowel disease. ""We've been thinking about me going to America for a while,"" Morgan told 7.30. ""We may have to do that,"" Mr Taylor said. ""Such a shame we can't do [cannabis juicing] in our own country."" Mr Taylor began to grow and juice his own cannabis after struggling to find a doctor who would help him through the Therapeutic Goods Administration's (TGA) lengthy application process to legally access medical marijuana. Last week, after pleading guilty to cultivation, Mr Taylor was given a six-month good behaviour bond but no conviction was recorded. Morgan Taylor has been in and out of hospital several times this year with her condition. She now has access to medicinal cannabis oil under the Federal Government's scheme because of her chronic pain, but not because of her Crohn's disease. Her sister Ariel missed out. If the oil does not work for Morgan she is considering going to the US. Bastian Seidel, president of the Royal College of GPs, is frustrated that so few patients are being given the option to access medicinal cannabis and so few doctors are being allowed to prescribe it. ""There are 38,000 GPs in the country — only one of them is an authorised prescriber for medicinal cannabis,"" he told 7.30. He said medical marijuana was still ""pretty much inaccessible"" for those who need it. ""The hurdles are still in place,"" Dr Seidel said. ""It is frustrating for us because medicinal cannabis might be an option of last resort for patients where we've tried absolutely everything in the book. ""Certainly this is not what patients expect. That's not what should be in place when it comes to medicinal cannabis. ""If your GP thinks you would benefit from medicinal cannabis as a treatment of last resort, then your GP should be allowed to prescribe it."" In a statement to 7.30, the TGA said 249 individual medical practitioners have had applications approved under its Special Access Scheme. It added that ""33 medical practitioners have been approved as authorised prescribers"". Iain McGregor, a psychopharmacologist at the Lambert Initiative For Cannabinoid Therapeutics at Sydney University, estimates as many as 100,000 people in the country may be using illegal cannabis for medical problems. ""They're self-medicating with cannabis that they get from friends or grow themselves,"" he told 7.30. ""There's this massive discrepancy between what Australians are doing covertly and the overt approved system which, so far, I would say, is probably not delivering."" Professor McGregor said juicing cannabis ""gives a very different cannabinoid profile than smoking cannabis"". ""In many ways, juicing is a positive thing to do because you don't get nearly as much of the intoxicating element, which is THC [tetrahyrdocannabinol], and you get another component of cannabinoid, which is THCA [tetrahydocannabinolic acid], which has very strong anti-inflammatory properties in the gut,"" he said. ""Proper clinical trials on THCA have not been done and this is one of the generic problems that we have with medicinal cannabis. ""This prohibition that we have over the years is really stymieing progress in terms of learning the therapeutic effects of the plant."" The TGA said 1059 people across the nation had been approved for the TGA scheme in the two years since the access was legalised in Australia.

64,"Cannabis oil failed to improve pain or quality of life in palliative care cancer patients, study shows",,"Researchers say despite the lack of symptom relief, more trials are needed to focus on the targeted use of medicinal cannabis The first high quality study looking at the impact of cannabidiol oil on palliative care patients with advanced cancer found it did not improve their pain, depression, anxiety, or quality of life. Palliative care is one of the conditions for which medicinal cannabis has been approved in Australia. The trial, led by the Mater hospital and the University of Queensland, studied the effects of cannabidiol oil, also known as CBD, on the relief of pain, depression, anxiety and quality of life on 144 patients receiving palliative care for cancer. The trial was double-blinded, which meant neither the researchers nor the participants knew whether they were getting medicinal cannabis or a placebo. All patients also received standard palliative care throughout the trial period. “The trial found there was no detectable effect of CBD on change in physical or emotional functioning, overall quality of life, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnoea or appetite loss,” lead author of the study and the director of palliative and supportive care at Mater, Prof Janet Hardy, said. But she added that the study only examined the effect of CBD. “The cannabis plant is very complex and contains a large number of cannabinoids and other compounds,” she said. “The two most prominent cannabinoids are CBD, which is cannabidiol, and THC, which is the one that makes you high when you smoke a joint. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Our next study will look at a combination of CBD and THC to see if you need to have THC to get any benefit from medicinal cannabis. The problem with that is CBD is very popular because it doesn’t have the psychoactive effects. It means you can drive and do other activities while on it, whereas it’s illegal to drive on THC, whether it’s taken for recreational or medicinal purposes.” CBD may also be useful for the treatment of cancer-related symptoms not examined in the study, she said, such as insomnia. Despite the lack of evidence of benefit, 36% of the study participants decided to buy a medicinal cannabis product after the trial, despite being unaware if they were taking the CBD or placebo. Hardy said it may be that CBD contributes to a greater feeling of general wellbeing, even if it did not improve specific symptoms. Hardy said the study aimed to fill the gap in scientific evidence supporting the use of medicinal cannabis for pain relief and symptom distress due to cancer. Sign up to Guardian Australia's Afternoon Update Our Australian afternoon update email breaks down the key national and international stories of the day and why they matter after newsletter promotion “The best way to describe the uptake of medicinal cannabis following its legalisation was as a social phenomenon,” she said. “Everyone wanted it, but there was little evidence to guide its usage. Usually, new products entering the market have gone through extensive pre-clinical studies regarding best dosage and usage, however medicinal cannabis entered the market with very little guidance.” The findings have been published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. A professor of pharmacology at Macquarie Medical School, Mark Connor, said “this might seem like a disappointing conclusion, but it’s an important one”. The study had found no adverse effects from CBD oil, he said, suggesting CBD is well tolerated and can be trialled on other patient groups with different conditions. “A trial like this is certainly a stepping stone to potentially larger trials that may be designed in a way that can focus on more targeted areas where cannabinoids may have an effect, for example on more specific symptoms like insomnia, or even in specific types of cancers,” he said. “And what we can see from this study is CBD seems well-tolerated, and is unlikely to make things worse.”",17,657
65,Medicinal cannabis: Government accused of defying will of Senate over importation,Wed 23 Aug 2017 at 12:35pm," Medicinal cannabis: Government accused of defying will of Senate over importation An attempt to open up access to imported medicinal cannabis for dying patients has failed, prompting accusations the executive arm of the Government is defying the will of the Parliament. In June a rainbow coalition of senators came together to defeat the Government and overturn restrictions on the importation of cannabis-based medicines for terminally ill patients. But in an email obtained by Lateline, the Government subsequently warned importers they would be in breach of their permit and licence conditions if they followed the will of the Senate. The email, sent by the Office of Drug Control in the Department of Health, notes the Senate vote ""allows access to medicinal cannabis products under the Special Access Scheme Category A"". But the email goes on to warn importers ""it is a breach of your permit and licence conditions if you supply any imported medicinal cannabis product to a patient under SAS-A"". Special Access Scheme for Category A enables medicines that are not on the register to be supplied to patients who are seriously ill and likely to die within months. Greens Leader Richard Di Natale said it was reprehensive behaviour by the Government. ""They've threatened importers that they will have their licence removed if they follow the law and make this drug available to people with a terminal illness,"" he told Lateline. Senator David Leyonhjelm said the Government was being ""cruel"".  ""Effectively, what that letter is saying is 'We don't care what the Senate decided. We're telling you, you will not sell your cannabis products to Category A patients or make those products available to them'."" The Greens disallowance motion passed the Senate 40-30 on June 13 with the support of Labor, One Nation and Senators Leyonhjelm, Jacqui Lambie, Derryn Hinch and Lucy Gichuhi. The Government imposed the original restrictions in October last year with the support of the Greens and Labor, fearing untested and unregulated medicines would put Australian patients at risk. Its cautious approach to importation has also been backed by the Australian Medical Association and the Royal College of GPs. A spokesman for Health Minister Greg Hunt said the email was not in defiance of the Senate, claiming the Greens and Labor were warned their motion would fail but they chose to mislead patients. Labor's health spokeswoman Catherine King told Lateline: ""The Government should be doing everything it can to expand patient access to medicinal cannabis, not hiding behind technicalities."" Senator Di Natale said the Greens would try again when Parliament returned. ""I'll be introducing legislation to the Parliament to ensure that anybody who needs access to medicinal cannabis who has a terminal illness can get it either through somebody importing it into Australia or indeed through a registered grower here in Australia.""

66,Former soldier Eli Turner prescribed medicinal cannabis after waiting months in 'unbearable' chronic pain,Thu 7 May 2020 at 8:43pm," Former soldier Eli Turner prescribed medicinal cannabis after waiting months in 'unbearable' chronic pain Doctors have labelled medicinal cannabis prescriptions a ""bureaucratic nightmare"" requiring ""a massive learning curve"", as patients say people in pain cannot wait months for relief. Wodonga's Eli Turner, suffers from a spinal condition called spondylosis after his time in the military and said he was ""very lucky"" to have a prescription for medicinal cannabis after waiting six months in unbearable pain. ""It doesn't eliminate the pain totally — nothing will,"" he said. ""But it definitely makes me able to move more and function more."" But the 39-year-old said receiving the prescription was very difficult. ""People are in a lot of pain and they can't wait because you can't function in that much pain,"" Mr Turner said. The former soldier asked his doctor about medicinal cannabis after he found out about a Department of Veterans' Affairs subsidy program. ""It costs so much for pain treatment of any type … there's no way I could have afforded it on my own,"" he said. No medicinal cannabis product is subsidised through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme [PBS], making it too expensive for many patients. But Mr Turner has been determined to avoid opioids to treat his pain after seeing his mother's experience with morphine before her death from lung disease. ""She was on a lot of morphine and it was just inhumane,"" he said. ""It was horrible. It was absolutely horrible. ""She was less than 40kg when she passed away."" Mr Turner has also seen the addictive effect of opioids on some of his mates from the army who have endured chronic pain. ""I was posted to a parachuting unit, so [back pain] comes with the area,"" he said. ""And a lot of them are having trouble getting off opioids … they probably never will."" His local doctor referred him to Mark Hardy, a Sydney-based addiction medicine specialist and the medical director at Cannabis Access Clinics. Dr Hardy helps doctors and patients around the country navigate the cannabis prescription process. ""One of the pitfalls for a lot of our GPs who we get referrals from is that they're very time pressured,"" he said. ""The writing to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) is time-consuming. ""Watching over the [cannabis] use, and potential for misuse, for a GP with little training in the area may be another impost on their time."" Doctors wishing to prescribe medicinal cannabis must apply to the TGA to seek individual patient approval — an approach Dr Hardy believed was lagging behind the latest research. ""We're seeing new evidence coming out in the medicinal cannabis space every month and if you're looking at guidelines from three years ago then you're looking at out-of-date guidelines,"" he said. ""This, for us, is one of our biggest challenges. ""Most of the opinion that is formed in regards to the legitimacy of our treatment is outdated by the time it's published and put to peer review."" Albury-Wodonga radiation oncologist, Craig Macleod, has looked into prescribing medicinal cannabis but said the process was too much of a ""bureaucratic nightmare"". The Federal Government has approved the sale of medicinal marijuana, but it still won't be easy for people to get a prescription. ""We investigated it through the hospital pharmacy but it's a heavily bureaucratic process so it's quite hard to get to order it in a simple fashion,"" he said. ""I think that there would be people interested in prescribing it … but, unless you've got a volume of patients that you're doing it for, it's too hard to do it for one or two patients."" Palliative care physician at Albury Wodonga Health, Chi Li, has prescribed medicinal cannabis for cancer patients but said there was ""a massive learning curve"". ""That's a disincentive for people to learn how to do it,"" he said. But he said that it was a relatively straightforward process after the initial barrier. A Senate committee has recommended widespread changes after a recent investigation into the problems around access to prescription cannabis and regulation.  Following this inquiry the TGA has proposed loosening restrictions for low-dose cannabidiol (CBD), a medicinal cannabis product. But many medical bodies believe there is still not enough evidence to support medicinal cannabis. Australia's peak medical body, the Australian Medical Association (AMA), said medicinal cannabis was a ""last resort"". ""The AMA position is that while there is widespread interest in medicinal cannabis, there is still insufficient information on efficacy, product availability, and education regarding its use,"" an AMA spokesperson said. Dr Hardy was optimistic this would change soon. ""I'm hopeful that in the coming years we'll be able to update the evidence based upon which people make their decisions,"" he said.

67,Cannabis oil advocate Jenny Hallam spared conviction for supplying medicinal cannabis,Thu 7 Nov 2019 at 12:30am," Cannabis oil advocate Jenny Hallam spared conviction for supplying medicinal cannabis A South Australian cannabis oil distributor has been spared a conviction for providing the drug to terminally ill people, with the judge saying her actions helped rather than harmed the recipients. Jenny Lee Hallam, 47, pleaded guilty to possessing and manufacturing a controlled drug in February. Her property, north of Adelaide, was raided in January 2017 and police found a number of packaged cannabis oil products in syringes and capsules. Judge Rauf Soulio today released Hallam on a good behaviour bond in Adelaide's District Court. He said it was clear Hallam had been making the oil at a financial loss, adding that there was no evidence any harm had been caused to any recipient of the cannabis oil and that the evidence was ""strongly to the contrary"". Outside court following the sentence, Hallam said she feared going to jail and thanked Judge Soulio for not convicting her. ""To me it sends a message that there's a problem with access out there, that people are desperate, that all they want is to heal themselves, and that people like me are just trying to save their lives,"" she said. ""I didn't want to break the law. I didn't want to be a criminal. I am not a criminal. But sometimes desperate people do desperate things. And these are desperate times when it comes to cannabis. ""It's over. It's a massive relief."" She said she had spent three years wondering what was going to happen, but now ""thankfully"" could move on. ""I can still look at all those kids and smile and know that they're still here and that there was a good reason for doing what I did,"" she said.  ""That I've helped a lot of people and made them happy, but I've also opened a lot of people's eyes to cannabis and what it does and how it's saving people's lives and how desperate people are to access it. ""All I ever wanted was for people to be happy and well."" ""At the moment people are miserable and they're sick and they're dying and they're watching their kids suffer and they're watching their family members suffer and we don't want that anymore,"" she said. ""When we know there's something out there that can help people, when someone like me, just a little old lady, in her kitchen can make something that saves people's lives.  ""There's something very, very wrong going on in this country, that the Government will not let people access it. ""There are still people all over Australia trying to access this medication and they cannot get it. I cannot get it in South Australia. ""I wouldn't break the law to do it again."" Hallam had faced a maximum jail sentence of seven years, a $35,000 fine for manufacturing a controlled drug Last month, the lawyer for Hallam urged the court not to convict or jail her because she needed to travel overseas as part of her new job. The court was told she was planning to take up employment at a privately-owned cannabis farm in northern New South Wales, known as the Australian Cannabis University. It heard its founder Dolph Cooke, who holds a licence to grow cannabis for medicinal purposes, wanted to hire Hallam as an employee for her expertise in oil production. But Hallam said she was still considering her options. Her friends and supporters, including former Dignity Party MP Kelly Vincent, applauded as Ms Hallam left the courtroom. ""Tears of joy and applause in the court today from myself and so many others because we've finally reached the point where a judge has recognised that Jenny Hallam is a healer, not a dealer,"" Ms Vincent said. ""Without medical cannabis products, which I have got legally myself — an over-the-counter product — I wouldn't be able to be here today. I would still be in bed, crying and screaming in pain. ""Instead I'm here supporting my friend, celebrating with my friend, before going off to a full day of work, study and looking after my family.

68,Medicinal cannabis farm allows rare glimpse into construction at secret Queensland location,Mon 31 Jul 2017 at 2:59am," Medicinal cannabis farm allows rare glimpse into construction at secret Queensland location A medicinal cannabis farm under construction in Queensland has opened its doors for the first time to offer an exclusive glimpse of its top-secret operation. Medifarm, based on the state's Sunshine Coast, has a rare licence granted by the Federal Government to cultivate, produce and manufacture medicinal cannabis. When the farm is up and running, it will produce cannabis oil for Australians with medical conditions. Strict security arrangements are in place to make sure the location of the farm is not compromised. Founder Adam Benjamin said security was paramount when growing such a controversial crop. ""We offered our security solutions which really focused on no diversions — which means if there was a potential threat out there, or even product that moves from the farm into distribution, it needs to at all times be tracked and accounted for,"" he said. ""So senior police, senior military personnel were brought in to advise, and we think we got it right."" It is the first time an Australian medicinal cannabis farm has allowed the media to visit. Non-disclosure forms had to be signed before reporters were taken in a convoy to the site. The Federal Government has approved the sale of medicinal marijuana, but it still won't be easy for people to get a prescription. Farm staff also undergo stringent checks before they are allowed to work there. ""All staff and all future staff go through a checklist, including Australian Federal Police background checks,"" Mr Benjamin said. While exact security arrangements cannot be discussed, the site is guarded 24/7. But Mr Benjamin conceded there was always the potential someone could stumble across its location. ""We are doing this on Earth, so there is the potential,"" he said. ""If someone was to find out, we believe our security measures and our counter measures will be right — it's very James Bond … but we came to market through the law and we're going to continue through the law."" The farm is currently under construction with greenhouses still being built. But it is hoped the first crop will be planted later this year. From there, the company is aiming to harvest four times a year, which could help thousands of people. ""Here we believe that what we are growing could service 5,000 patients,"" Mr Benjamin said. ""Potentially in Queensland, you're looking at 100,000 patients who could gain benefit from this as a medicine. ""We will have product cultivated and ready for distribution in the first quarter next year.""

70,Victoria has high hopes of becoming cannabis bowl of Australia,Sat 26 Jan 2019 at 9:25pm," Victoria has high hopes of becoming cannabis bowl of Australia Medicinal cannabis farms are sprouting up around Australia, with demand for the product ramping up in spite of some doctors warning the drug is ""not the cure-all"" many believe it to be. Authorities have only granted 3,200 approvals for the legal use of the medicine in two-and-a-half decades, but with 2,500 of those coming last year, the sector is forecasting a year of big growth. And with more countries legalising medicinal cannabis in recent years, figures in the growing industry say access to export markets will play a key role in establishing the local industry. Medical cannabis is not approved by the nation's Therapeutic Goods Administration, but can be accessed through the Special Access Scheme, which authorises approved doctors to prescribe the drug.  Trials of the drug are underway in Australia, and have the backing of the Australian Medical Association (AMA). ""Let's look at where it has a role to play,"" AMA president Tony Bartone said. ""It's not a panacea, it's not going to be the cure-all that some people think it will be, [but] we need to understand what its potential role is."" Advocates are hoping use of the drug will become more widespread, and businesses are investing in growing and producing medical cannabis, pinning their hopes on a surge in the trade. As many as 100,000 people are estimated to buy medicinal cannabis on the black market, and the potential legal market could be many times that. Business is not only eyeing off domestic use but also foreign markets, with Thailand joining the list of countries legalising medical cannabis. Analyst Matthijs Smith predicts 2019 will be a big year for the local industry, with Australia well placed to capitalise on global and local interest. ""Australia has been producing botanical-based medicines in the form of opioids for many years,"" Mr Smith said. ""In fact, we are the leading exporters of medical opioids, and I think we can translate that experience into the medical cannabis scene. ""There are over 100,000 people in Australia currently using medical cannabis for genuine medical purposes. ""My personal view is that is an underestimate of the potential market, which I think is probably more like 250,000 to 500,000 people."" CannGroup chief executive Peter Crock said access to export markets was important while Australian regulations were still restricted and developed. ""We don't have enough demand [locally] and it would be too difficult to set up a new industry with such a low patient base,'' he said.  ""But it will change quicker with access to more product — that's why exports are so important."" Nearly all medicinal cannabis in Australia is imported, making access to the drug prohibitive for many struggling families. But local businesses like Cannatrek are aiming to make the product more affordable. The company is currently suppling medical cannabis from Canadian sources, and has set up a research facility in Brisbane. It will begin to build a 160,000-square-metre greenhouse facility in Shepparton later this year, creating 65 jobs, and chief executive Tommy Huppert believes the industry can create thousands of jobs across Australia. ""The idea is that we will be able to manufacture, cultivate and produce affordable medicines to the patients,"" Mr Huppert said. ""It could well be up to 20 per cent of pain management medicines, so that is quite significant. ""We understand from initial data there are currently over 100,000 eligible patients for cannabis medicines in Australia."" The Victorian Government has been involved in the research and development of the local industry, and has ambitions to be the cannabis bowl of Australia with a target of 500 local jobs. ""We are renowned for our agricultural products, but we are also a gateway to Asia,"" Victorian Agriculture Minister Jaclyn Symes said.  ""This is a very exciting industry. They are all moving here because they see the opportunity that is on our doorstep."" Another cannabis business, Cronos, is also setting up its headquarters in Melbourne. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt told Four Corners last year that Australian businesses would have to guarantee first access to Australian patients as a condition of an export licence. Sydney mum Jo Freeman is a fierce advocate for medicinal cannabis.  Her six-year-old son Cooper has not suffered a major epileptic fit since he began taking cannabis oil nearly 12 months ago. ""You will never ever be able to put into words what it means for us,'' Ms Freeman said. Ms Freeman said she was fortunate to find a doctor to help her get cannabis legally, but admits to buying unapproved product from ""Nimbin people"" in the past in a desperate bid to help her son. She wants access broadened and governments to assist with costs, with some people spending tens of thousands of dollars. ""The costs are so staggering that for the average person it is just unachievable,"" she said. Inquiries from parents of epileptic children about medicinal cannabis happens nearly every day, Epilepsy Action Australia chief executive Carol Ireland said. She said cannabis was a promising treatment option for the 250,000 people in Australia diagnosed with epilepsy, especially for the third that did not get seizure control with currently available and approved anti-epileptic medications.  But she said the challenges were significant. ""Many doctors are still very reluctant to prescribe cannabis or they are unclear about how to navigate the processes the government have established,"" Ms Ireland said. ""When they do get a prescription, costs can be astronomical. ""We have heard ranges of $35,000 to $50,000 for paediatric epilepsy, unless the child is one of the few who gets on to a clinical trial.""

71,Why more people are turning to medicinal cannabis,"September 28, 2020 — 3.59pm","We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 2 years ago On a back country road in northern NSW, up a nondescript dirt driveway, sits a highly secret facility. Surrounded by strict security, thousands of cannabis plants are being carefully cultivated in state-of-the-art greenhouses for the medicinal cannabis market. Australian Natural Therapeutics Group CEO, Matthew Cantelo, surrounded by cannabis that is about to be harvested.Credit:Janie Barrett The Australian Natural Therapeutics Group facility, near Armidale, is about to start producing medicinal cannabis oil on a commercial scale – the first such manufacturing licence granted in the state. The company's chief executive Matthew Cantelo said he had noticed quite a large increase of approvals under the Special Access Scheme, as well as a rise in the number of authorised prescribers. ""[That] tells us that doctors are having more confidence in the safety and efficacy of the products,"" he said. ""Also, the research is catching up."" Professor Iain McGregor, from the Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics at the University of Sydney, said there was ""increasingly good evidence"" that cannabis was effective. ""It helps people get off more sinister drugs, particularly prescription opioids and Lyrica-type drugs as well, which can be very problematic,"" he said. Cannabis has two main chemical components. THC is the psychoactive ingredient, responsible for giving people the ""high"" feeling. Cannabidiol, or CBD, does not have the same psychoactive effect. Both are used in different levels as treatments for various conditions. Medicinal cannabis might not be a common household drug, but it's a growing business in Australia. Since 1992, 61,000 approvals for medicinal cannabis had been granted by the Therapeutic Goods Administration through the Special Access Scheme, but most of these have occurred in the past few years. Since August last year approvals have doubled, from 2878 to 5739. Between June and July this year alone, approvals rose by 20 per cent. There have been some big changes in the past four years that have helped improve access, including the introduction of medicinal cannabis clinics, improved information for prescribers and a drop in product price. Professor McGregor said that today, medicinal cannabis costs roughly 25 per cent of what it did in 2017, or about $5 to $15 per day per patient. Workers trimming cannabis plants. The flower heads will be processed for medicinal sale, and sold as flowers or an oil product.Credit:Janie Barrett The price drop has been aided by the sheer number of products now available on the Australian market, with about 150 different medicinal flower and oil products being sold by 37 companies, which are fighting for a small number of patients. ""We used to joke that there was one patient for every company in this space in Australia,"" Professor McGregor said. The TGA has also recently released an interim decision to downgrade certain medicinal cannabis products from Schedule 4 to Schedule 3, which would allow approved low-dose products to be sold over the counter at the pharmacy. But that decision is not final and Mr Cantelo, who started building the medicinal cannabis company in earnest about five years ago, is playing the long game. At the moment just one-quarter of their flower produce is sold to Australian patients while the rest is exported. Production is starting on its first commercial oil product, and he said there would be four of those in coming months. ""We’ve got four products on the market to Australian patients right now ranging from a high CBD, very low THC product right up through to a very high THC, low CBD product and two in the middle,"" he said. Most approvals were for chronic pain, a TGA spokesman said. Medicinal cannabis has also been approved for cancer pain and fibromyalgia, for managing seizures or epilepsy, to treat psychological conditions including anxiety, anorexia, insomnia or post-traumatic stress disorder, and for multiple sclerosis and other movement disorders. While the TGA spokesman said the number of approvals fluctuated from month to month, more doctors were now prescribing it. Cannabis seedlings at the secret Australian Natural Therapeutics Group facility.Credit:Janie Barrett Last year 1298 individual prescribers sent Special Access Scheme applications to the TGA. This year to date, the TGA has received applications from 1827 individuals; a 41 per cent increase. Royal Australian College of General Practitioners spokeswoman Hester Wilson said applications were increasing in part because of medicinal cannabis clinics, but GPs were increasingly seeing it as an option for longstanding patients on a case-by-case basis. ""We do need to increase the evidence around when medicinal cannabis is appropriate; and that's really not clear,"" she said. A worker on the Australian Natural Therapeutics Group farm prunes the plants.Credit:Janie Barrett ""But it is one of those situations where sometimes for us, as individual prescribers who know our patients well, that it absolutely is a choice that we can and do make in order to assist the individual patients that we're seeing."" Dr Wilson, who is also an addiction specialist, said it would only be something she would prescribe if she had been having an extended conversation about it with a patient she knew well and they were both clear about the expected outcome. ""They do need to be aware of the risks and the fact that we don't know what the benefits are,"" she said. ""So I really do take a very cautious approach."" Professor McGregor, who recently co-authored a paper comparing medicinal cannabis access around the world, said while there had been almost exponential growth in medicinal cannabis use, Australia had a long way to go. Professor McGregor said the federal government’s own statistics from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare estimated there were 600,000 people who were self-medicating with cannabis from the black market. ""[With] a liberal estimate of maybe 30,000 patients being serviced by the official scheme, then you've still got 570,000 that are unaccounted for,"" he said. ""I don't think we should be slapping ourselves on the back too firmly at this stage, we’ve still a long way to go. But the trends are certainly a lot more positive than they were.""

72,"Medicinal cannabis products 'sitting in warehouses', Senate committee told amid concerns about access",Mon 29 May 2017 at 8:04pm," Medicinal cannabis products 'sitting in warehouses', Senate committee told amid concerns about access Fewer than 150 people in Australia have ever been given approved access to medicinal cannabis products and there are only 25 authorised prescribers of the drugs, according to evidence at a Senate estimates committee. Officials from the Health Department told the hearing that figure had only increased by two since February, and most of those doctors were in New South Wales.  ""We now have 25, it would have been good to have a greater increase but we are responsive to what applications we receive from ethics committees, so we can't write these things ourselves,"" said the department's deputy secretary in charge of drug regulation, adjunct Professor John Skerritt. Patients can access medicinal cannabis products either through a special access scheme, or from an authorised prescriber. The committee was told that since the first application in 1992, a total of 89 patients had been given access to a small number of medicinal cannabis products through the special access scheme, and another 41 were issued prescriptions by an authorised doctor. In late 2016, the Therapeutic Goods Administration made cannabis a controlled, rather than prohibited, substance for medical purposes, and the Federal Government has legalised the cultivation of the drug in Australia. But at the same time, it removed the ability of doctors to prescribe terminally ill patients some previously approved products without the need to seek prior authorisation, under what is known as Category A of the special access scheme. Patients now have to use Category B of the scheme, which requires prior approval. The Federal Government has approved the sale of medicinal marijuana, but it still won't be easy for people to get a prescription. Greens Leader Richard Di Natale said that meant there was no longer quick access to two specific cannabis-based drugs. ""So it's fair to say that it's now harder to access medicinal cannabis or related products than it was prior to this legislation, through Category A,"" he said. But Professor Skerritt said the Government was speeding up approvals under Category B. ""I think there's a clear pathway for patients to be able to access the product; there's product sitting in warehouses in major capital cities of Australia, and the Commonwealth is taking two days in its approvals,"" he said. He said patients who were struggling to access cannabis products needed to ask their doctor to apply through the special access scheme.  ""There are supplies of the cannabinodal-rich medicines sitting in Australia, sufficient to treat many hundreds if not thousands of children, so they basically have to go through the process,"" he sad. ""I often muse that the time spent in complaining about a process, when it is a one-page form with some attachments for applying for access, you'd get the access much faster that way."" Professor Skerritt told the committee the Health Department was working with clinical colleges and other medical groups to increase knowledge about medicinal cannabis, but said it was not the Government's role to advocate for their use.

73,Medicinal cannabis trial gets green light on Norfolk Island: Tasman Health Cannabinoids gets production licence,Fri 1 Aug 2014 at 9:40am," Medicinal cannabis trial gets green light on Norfolk Island: Tasman Health Cannabinoids gets production licence The Tasmanian company that applied to trial medicinal cannabis in the state has been given the go-ahead elsewhere. Like Tasmania, Norfolk Island has an historic past that struggles financially and depends on assistance from the Commonwealth.  But as the island's Health Minister Robin Adams explained, it was keen to pull itself out of that mire. ""We are open for investment, we are open for business on Norfolk Island,"" she said. We are open for investment we are open for business on Norfolk Island Norfolk Island is an external territory of Australia - it is not part of Australia's taxation or welfare system.  Dependent on tourism, it was hit hard by the global financial crisis. Ms Adams said the island saw visitor numbers halve from around 40,000 a year to 20,000. ""We see this as a great opportunity both for the economy of Norfolk Island whilst providing a much needed medical product for export,"" she said.  The island's government has given Tasman Health Cannabinoids (THC) approval to grow medical cannabis. THC had wanted to conduct its trial in Tasmania, with the view to it becoming a multi-billion-dollar export industry. ""The Health Minister on Norfolk Island Robin Adams has now given us a production licence to go ahead and progress to grow on Norfolk medical cannabinoids,"" said the chairman of THC, Dr Mal Washer. THC had been lobbying the Tasmanian Government to grow the product in the state in a trial with the University of Tasmania. The Tasmanian Government knocked them back. Ms Adams said Norfolk Island leapt at the chance.  ""We have our own dangerous drugs legislation and that legislation was amended with the consent of the Commonwealth of Australia back in 1997,"" she said. ""As a result of that legislative change I may grant a licence to import cannabis into Norfolk Island, export from Norfolk Island, plant, cultivate tend or harvest cannabis and sell cannabis,"" she said. Dr Washer said the company would press on with the trial on Norfolk Island rather than THC's home state of Tasmania for two reasons. ""One, obviously shareholders want a profit from this,"" he said. ""I personally, and a lot of shareholders feel the same as me, the main reason ...is to really try and get the best quality product we can, [a] medical cannabinboid product for export to the country where it's legal."" Medical cannabis is legal in a number of European countries, Canada and more than 20 states in the United States. The drug is sold by weight. In a recent article in the Wall Street Journal it was estimated the drug costs about $US1,000 to produce a pound (about 450g), the same weight sells for $US7,500. THC's chief executive Troy Langman said it would be a profitable industry once it was established.  ""In November we're hoping to kick things off and three to four months later we should have our first harvest, and indoors we're looking at around three harvests per year,"" he said. Mr Langman has been on Norfolk Island this week working on the licensing arrangements and regulatory regime.  ""We're still hoping to fulfil our initial order that we were lucky to obtain from Canada, that was 1,000kg,"" he said. Dr Washer said there would be strict growing and security requirements. ""I guess we'd be looking at a 10-acre site and a glasshouse would cover the bulk of that,"" he said. Mr Langman said he was now in the process of obtaining enough cannabis seeds to get the project started.  ""We'll be obtaining our strains through legal channels from both universities in Australia where there's seed banks and also of course the option to obtain seeds from places like Canada and also from Europe,"" he said. But Mr Langman said THC was not giving up on Tasmania.  ""We'll continue to push ahead, there's different strains that we want to grow in Tassie's climate we feel really committed to Tassie,"" he said.  Dr Washer believed there was growing momentum for change in Australia. ""There's five jurisdictions currently looking at this,"" he said ""Federally of course too, my good friend Warren Entsch, when I spoke to him only a couple of weeks ago intends to introduce a bill into the Federal Parliament to legalise medical cannabinoids."" As well as employment there is likely to be hefty returns to Norfolk Island coffers. Ms Adams said exactly how much was still being decided, with taxes under discussion. ""I'm of the view that this new industry will align perfectly with the vision that I share with many in this community, that Norfolk Island has the potential to be a centre for health and wellbeing in the Pacific,"" she said. Tasmania's shadow attorney-general, Lara Giddings, said Tasmania has missed a big opportunity, losing potential investment and jobs. ""This medicinal cannabis industry could provide that while also providing medical and pain relief for those who need it,"" she said. The company hopes to start planting on Norfolk Island in November.

74,"Cannabis farm approved for western Brisbane, but nearby residents not consulted",Fri 10 Aug 2018 at 10:13pm," Cannabis farm approved for western Brisbane, but nearby residents not consulted In the midst of a rapidly growing medicinal cannabis industry, Brisbane's western suburbs could soon house what is thought to be the city's first cannabis farm. The Brisbane City Council (BCC) has confirmed that two months ago it approved a development application for a horticulture operation in Brisbane's west with minimal public consultation. The operation is two minutes' drive from a state school and alongside a sports park and children's playground currently under construction. ""The proposal was to commercially cultivate, store and pack medicinal marijuana,"" a council spokesman said. ""The site is zoned for rural uses, such as farming and horticulture, and was also approved by the Queensland Government."" BCC opposition planning spokesman Councillor Jared Cassidy said the approval was a step in the right direction, but residents should have been advised. ""We do support the use of this site for medical marijuana, it is a rural-zoned site, but people deserve to know what's going on in their community and we'll be interested to see people's reactions to this,"" Cr Cassidy said. ""There's surrounding properties and sports fields near there, so we're calling on council to make sure that that is all managed and people are well aware with what's going on and through the approval process, strict controls are put on around that as well. ""We think it's an exciting opportunity, particularly for parents with very sick children where evidence has shown that medicinal cannabis may be the only treatment."" The development application attracted only one public submission.  It argued that it would not be ""appropriate that certain plants be grown right next door to a sports facility that will cater to children"". ""It is not appropriate for a decision to be made without community consultation and a disclosure of the whole purpose of the application to the community,"" the submission said. Nearby residents told the ABC they knew nothing about the plan. Some echoed concerns, while others were supportive of the plan. City planning chair Councillor Matthew Bourke said BCC essentially had to be blind to what is being grown, as cannabis approvals were granted by the Federal Government. ""Council has no ability to control the actual type of crops that are grown on land that is zoned for rural or horticultural purposes, we have to assess the development application against the relevant provisions inside our planning scheme,"" he said. Two years ago, State Parliament granted GPs the ability to prescribe medicinal cannabis.  However, barriers still exist for doctors to prescribe related drugs. Dr James Finn from the Queensland branch of the Australian Medical Association said increasing the amount of cannabis manufactured in Australia would improve clinical trials. ""We need the product, we need different varieties of the product,"" he said. ""There's no reason that a safe, secure country like Australia can't be a producer for the export market of cannabis derivative products,"" he said. This year across Australia there has been an almost five-fold increase in licences granted to farms to grow medicinal cannabis.  There have 29 licences granted in Australia authorising cultivation and production of medicinal cannabis.

75,Medicinal marijuana and the lengths Australian farmers must go to in securely growing it,Thu 8 Jun 2017 at 9:45pm,"ABC Rural Medicinal marijuana and the lengths Australian farmers must go to in securely growing it Fingerprint scanners, motion sensor laser alarms, security teams and top secret locations sound like the stuff of spy movies, not Australian farms. But that is the reality for a new breed of farmers trying their hand at medicinal cannabis, who have to make sure the crop is secure from paddock to processor. ""Imagine having all kinds of questions thrown at you like 'What happens if someone shows up with a gun, what are you going to do?'"" said Adam Benjamin from Medifarm, a Sunshine Coast-based company and the first in Queensland to be given the green light to grow the controversial crop under strict licence.  Industry regulator the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has now approved 12 businesses in Australia to grow or manufacture medicinal cannabis. However, farmers wanting to do so first have to prove their crop will not fall into the hands of thieves and end up on the black market. ""Some of these conversations are exciting when you have senior police who have come to the facility to look at what you're doing,"" Mr Benjamin said.  ""We have also had military advisors come in. When even they are quite impressed by what we're doing, we know we are doing the job right."" So secret is the location of Medifarm, ABC Rural had to meet Mr Benjamin at a local café rather than on-site. Mr Benjamin asked that the name of the town not be mentioned. He was even hesitant to discuss security measures installed at the site, so as not to educate potential thieves. The Department of Health has received more than 75 applications to grow or manufacture medicinal cannabis in Australia, since legalising the practice in October.  Only 12 have been approved, and while no applications have been rejected, some applicants have withdrawn their proposal due to the difficult security requirements. ""Depending on the size of your facility it moves into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, so you need money in the bank,"" Mr Benjamin said. ""But if you can [invest] then it is well worth it. Adequate security measures can cost up to half a million dollars, but Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt is unapologetic about the tough standards imposed on growers. ""This is a product the medical authorities deem to be the strictest category product and it is at risk of unsafe use or criminal diversion,"" he said. ""So you can't have anything other than high safety and security requirements. It would be utterly negligent and irresponsible for us not to do that."" Growers and manufacturers of medicinal cannabis also have to demonstrate the vehicles they use to transport cannabis on the roads are safe from hijackers.  Mr Hunt argues the tough standards are not holding the industry back, or deterring future farmers.  ""There are some who would say let's have no restrictions. I disagree, the medical authorities disagree,"" he said. ""But the proof is in the pudding because the farmers are still applying.  ""The significant number of applications is evidence that the farming and growing community has embraced this opportunity and will deliver on it."" Keeping cannabis grown for medicinal purposes from the black market is not just a health and safety issue, it is also a cost one for farmers and manufacturers. The crop is too valuable to risk it being stolen. ""Medicinal cannabis oils in their pure forms [cost] around the same as gold, around about $US30,000 per kilo or litre, which sounds like a lot but that is a pure form,"" Mr Benjamin said.  Only one of the 12 companies approved to grow medicinal cannabis currently has crop in the ground, and is nearing cultivation.  This means the first lot of Australian-grown medicinal cannabis products could be on the domestic market towards the end of the year. Mr Hunt said the Australian industry had even bigger potential. ""I would like to see it expand from domestic growth and consumption, on a very safe regulated basis, for the potential to be an export crop,"" he said. ""It is important that Australia becomes a natural global supplier of medicinal cannabis for the genuine therapeutic market."" It is a big expectation, but not impossible considering Tasmania's success at opiate production, a crop that is also required to be grown under tough security standards.  While the domestic cannabis industry gains momentum the Australian Medical Association (AMA) is cautioning against crop falling into the hands of drug users or the black market trade. Medicinal cannabis usually comes in the form of oils or sprays, however a spokesperson for the TGA said approvals for raw cannabis products have also been granted under a special access scheme.  ""Our position is very clear, in terms of there is no role for recreational use of medicinal cannabis,"" vice president Tony Bartone said. ""It is not something we want to see or see it get into the wrong hands."" The AMA is also waiting to see if Australian-grown and made medicinal cannabis drugs are on par with their overseas counterparts. Most of the existing research into the health claims of medicinal cannabis relied on crop grown overseas, so medical professionals in Australia are waiting to see the outcomes of studies into locally made cannabis drugs.  That research will help to develop guidelines for Australian medical professionals wanting to prescribe the drug. ""Because of the peculiarities of the plant it varies in consistency and component nature from one [growing] area to another,"" Dr Bartone said. ""These [local studies] are also occurring to ensure that what the guidelines and evidence show is based on locally produced and sourced products as well."" The clinical trials are currently being run by academics from the Universities of New South Wales, Sydney and Queensland, with support from the TGA and state and territory health departments. The AMA said there is some overseas evidence to show medicinal cannabis has a role to play in reducing the symptoms of epilepsy, as well as easing the nausea experienced by anorexia sufferers or people taking HIV medication. ""There is also some preliminary evidence pointing to a role [medicinal cannabis plays] in other neurological disorders,"" Dr Bartone said. However, despite the surge in public support for medicinal cannabis and the issuing of licences for companies to grow or process medicinal cannabis, the TGA said there is only limited evidence from clinical trials and in medical literature to back its health claims. ""The incompleteness of evidence is due to few trials being possible around the world due to medicinal cannabis products being generally prohibited or heavily controlled in research in countries such as the US until fairly recently,"" a TGA spokesperson said. If the local studies amount to more support of Australian-grown medicinal cannabis it will give local farmers, and not just pharmaceutical companies, more confidence to spend big and invest in the industry.

77,"'Ignorant, confused or misinformed': Senate Committee Inquiry recommends overhaul of medicinal cannabis system",25 Mar 2020,"Patients are potentially missing out on medicinal cannabis treatment, or using the black market to obtain illegal supplies due to a lack of understanding of the treatment by doctors, a Senate inquiry has heard. The inquiry has made 20 recommendations, ranging from online training programs for practitioners and a mandatory inclusion of medicinal cannabis modules in primary medical program curriculums, to allowing practitioners to more easily prescribe multiple products and 'compassionate pricing' for patients.  Lucy Haslam from United in Compassion says the recommendations give the Government a good starting point.  ""We need the Government to acknowledge there's a problem with access and to feel motivated to do something to help the patients that are badly affected,"" she said.  ""I really hope that they won't keep ignoring this problem. We had to really fight to get this inquiry and that's concerning in the first instance. ""The work's been done now, a lot of people have made submissions, and I think it's really important the government via the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) listens to those recommendations."" Medicinal cannabis in Australia is typically accessed through your doctor submitting an application on your behalf through the Special Access Scheme (SAS), with the scheme allowing doctors to supply a specific product for a specific patient.  Practitioners can also become 'Authorised Prescribers' for a particular product.  More than 19-thousand patients have been granted access to medicinal cannabis through the SAS and Authorised Prescriber pathways combined, but an estimated 100-thousand Australians are self-medicating through the black market.  The inquiry said health practitioners' limited knowledge of the pathways available to prescribe medicinal cannabis was hindering access for many patients.  ""There is evidence that many patients and doctors are ignorant, confused or misinformed about the process and regulatory framework supporting access to medicinal cannabis in Australia,"" it said. Cost was also highlighted as a significant concern for patients, both attempting to access medicinal cannabis, along with the cost of any medication.  ""It is clear that the significant costs associated with accessing medicinal cannabis legally are causing a large number of Australians to purchase or grow illicit cannabis for self-medication,"" the committee said.  Key to the issue of cost is the unavailability of medicinal cannabis through the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS), which gives patients subsidised medicine. The committee recommended that, until products are subsidised through the PBS, the Federal Government investigate establishing a Commonwealth Compassionate Access Subsidy Scheme for medicinal cannabis and encourage states and territories to expand provisions of their own Compassionate Access Schemes.  Queensland man Kevin James has been using medicinal cannabis for his chronic back pain since 2018 and agrees cost and education are two of the biggest issues.  ""The system as it currently stands is too expensive, we need more accessibility, we need to make it affordable and we need to educate doctors.  ""We need to bring into institutions such as universities courses about how it actually helps your body and all these things doctors are unaware of and don't get in their current training.""  The committee recommended a new independent regulator be considered if issues relating to patient access hadn't been addressed a year from the report. Greens health spokesperson, Dr Richard Di Natale helped establish the inquiry and said the committee had ""taken a good look at the system, and we know it's not working."" ""There are a range of changes the Government needs to make now, and if they don't fix this mess, the system needs to be overhauled and an independent regulator put in place,"" he said. ""Cost is a hugely prohibitive factor for many patients. ""It's completely unacceptable that people can be out of pocket thousands of dollars for trying to access legal medicinal cannabis products through a regulated system when the black market is far cheaper."" ""People should never have to consider breaking the law to access the medical treatments they need, especially when the government claims they support patient access through the appropriate channels."" Ms Haslam said cost needed to be addressed too.  ""Let's face it, they've created this system where cannabis is in this regulatory limbo and unable to be subsidised as other normal medicines would be, so they've created the system where pricing has become such a big issue,"" she said.  ""So they should have some appetite to do something to try and address that cost, which throughout the inquiry seemed to be one of the biggest, if not the biggest factor for patients."" The committee also recommended states and territories review criminal legislation relating to an amnesty for possession and cultivation of cannabis for genuine self-medication purposes, along with drug driving laws.  ""The committee is also concerned about the legal implications faced by people who use medicinal cannabis products and drive.""  ""These people may be subject to serious legal penalties for the presence of THC in their system, even if there is no evidence of impairment at the time of driving.""

78,NSW looks at driver monitoring tech for medicinal cannabis users,"April 2, 2023 — 5.01am","We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. Legalise Cannabis NSW lead candidate Jeremy Buckingham, who is close to winning a seat in the NSW upper house, is calling for trials to measure driver impairment to ensure those prescribed medicinal cannabis aren’t discriminated against for taking their medication. One trial may include using driver monitoring technology, which assesses a driver’s fatigue and distraction by scanning the face and eyes. Currently, it is against the law in NSW for a person to drive with any amount of THC – a psychoactive component of cannabis – present in their body, even if it is prescribed. THC causes impairment for anywhere between two and eight hours but can show up in roadside drug tests for up to three days. Other prescription drugs do not show up in roadside testing. Richard Francis sources his cannabis from Astrid Dispensary and believes the drug driving laws are unfair. Credit:Natalie Grono “[Driving law reform] will be the first cab off the rank,” Buckingham said. “It’s a massive disincentive for people to take the medicine that they legally can take when they’re not driving impaired in any way, shape, or form, and it’s a massive disincentive for doctors to prescribe it.” Founding chair of Swinburne University’s working group for Driver Monitoring Systems, Amie Hayley, said it was difficult to infer impairment by the presence of THC in saliva. Experimental research, she said, has shown that patients don’t display driving impairment that would usually be associated with recreational cannabis use. “[Research] is disentangling the idea that the presence of THC is automatically correlated to impairment,” she said. Her research has been looking at how eye-tracking technology in cars, known as a Driver Monitoring Systems, could be used to monitor the impact of different drugs and different dosages, to see when someone may be impaired versus just having the drugs in their system. Driver Monitoring Systems will be made mandatory in vehicles sold in the European Union from 2024. The technology alerts the driver when their blinking patterns, eye movements and head positions change. If the monitoring system senses someone has fallen unconscious, the car will slow and pull over, with emergency services notified. The number of people accessing medicinal cannabis has grown exponentially since it was legalised in 2016 with more than 345,000 Australians approved to use the medicine but head of patient advocacy and engagement at Astrid Cannabis Dispensary in Byron Bay said the driving laws were deterring people from accessing their medication. “We see it on a weekly basis,” she said. Astrid Dispensary has gained 18,000 cannabis patients in the two years since it opened. “We get patients whose entire livelihood is dependent on using their medication and being able to drive ... It’s impacted patients from being able to maintain their employment. That loss of income has a domino effect,” she said, which is especially hard for patients using cannabis for psychological conditions. Head of Patient Advocacy and Engagement Bee Mohamed said education and consultancy are important for new cannabis users. Credit:Natalie Grono It was an incredibly tough period for Michael, who lives in Sydney and asked for his surname to be withheld, when he had his licence suspended for six months in 2021 after THC showed up in a roadside drug test. He has been prescribed cannabis for PTSD, anxiety, insomnia and chronic back pain and had smoked THC cannabis about eight hours before driving. Michael said he was in no way impaired and was following his doctors’ directions. “The impact was substantial. I [have] extreme family emergencies 24/7 and not having a licence just removes you from being able to do all the things that are necessary,” he said. “It’s unfair.” Byron Bay resident Richard Francis, who is prescribed medicinal cannabis for anxiety, said he’s confident using his prescribed medication and driving – but fears undergoing roadside drug tests. “People are allowed to have two standard drinks and drive, yet I’m not allowed to take my prescribed medicine?” he said. Melbourne-based mother-of-two Alice Davy uses CBD oil during the day and THC at night to help with multiple sclerosis and stage four endometriosis. By the time she wakes up to drive her children to school, she said, she’s “not impaired at all”. Mother-of-two Alice Davy said she feels safer driving while using prescription cannabis than other pharmaceuticals.  Before being prescribed cannabis, she wouldn’t drive because of the range of pharmaceuticals she was taking. “I’m more worried about getting in the car days after taking valium because you wake up foggy,” she said. Now, she drives between Melbourne and regional NSW to visit family and seek MS treatment. “That wouldn’t have been possible on all the other drugs,” she said. “Changing these laws is a no-brainer.” Former Lismore magistrate David Heilpern said NSW’s hard stance on drug driving had done nothing to decrease road deaths. He stepped down from the courts in 2020 in protest of the cannabis drug driving laws. In 2019, NSW police were given the power to impose a three-month licence suspension on anyone with THC in their system, along with a fine of $587. “Why should we even think for a moment that we need a special rule just because the drug was once an illicit drug?” he said. “There’s no reason for it to be specially treated.” But acting deputy secretary for safety, environment and regulation at Transport for NSW Sally Webb said the laws were necessary to protect other drivers. “THC can affect cognitive and motor skills necessary for safe driving, such as attention, judgment, memory, vision and co-ordination,” she said. “These rules are in place to discourage people from driving when they are under influence to reduce the risk of a fatal crash and maintain the safety of all road users.” Webb said the department was continuing “to monitor developments in vehicle technologies that support road safety, including the Driver Monitoring System technology”. The NSW government is monitoring drug-driving research and developments relevant to drug-driving policy as part of the 2026 Road Safety Action Plan. Copyright © 2023",10,1018
79,"Medical cannabis: Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales join forces on cannabis oil in medical trials",Sat 18 Apr 2015 at 11:01pm," Medical cannabis: Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales join forces on cannabis oil in medical trials The Queensland and Victorian state governments have joined forces with New South Wales to take part in medicinal cannabis clinical trials. The NSW Government introduced the scientific trials last year to help treat patients with drug-resistant and uncontrollable epilepsy. The new agreement means Victorians and Queenslanders suffering terminal or life-threatening conditions can take part in the NSW clinical trials. The three trials will be conducted by the NSW Government and will examine the use of cannabis in providing relief for patients. Victoria's Health Minister Jill Hennessy said the first trial would be open to children with severe, drug resistant epilepsy, due to start mid next year. ""There's a series of experts that oversee the eligibility for who gets to partake and we'll be doing all we can to support Victorian families and Victorian kids who meet that eligibility criteria to participate in the trial,"" she said. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the focus of the trial would be for families whose children suffer from life-threatening seizures. ""Sometimes they're happening on a weekly and a daily basis, being rushed to hospital and this medical cannabis oil, there's scientific research which says that it can alleviate the pain that these young children are going through,"" she said. Queensland Health Minister Cameron Dick says the clinical trials will set a framework to explore the possibility of regulated medical cannabis in the state, but the trials are dependant on the advice of medical researchers. ""I'm hopeful the work can be completed this year. If they advise us they want to take a longer approach, particularly with complex illnesses like epilepsy - there are neurological aspects of that - we'll have paediatric neurologists, senior adult neurologists involved in that,"" he said. ""You have to look at the different types of treatments and the different types of illnesses which are all unique. ""We don't want to cut off one path for treatment of people just to get an outcome in one particular area."" The Australian Medical Association Queensland (AMAQ) said it supported scientific trials into the use of medicinal cannabis. AMAQ president Dr Shaun Rudd said the trials would determine if it was safe. ""We think it's a great idea - we've always wanted to get further evidence to see if this is something that we can use, medically or not,"" he said. ""Hopefully with the trials we'll find out what components of the cannabis itself is the useful ones for medical treatment."" Medicinal cannabis advocate Debra Camacho has thanked Ms Palaszczuk ahead of the announcement. Ms Camacho said her 10-year-old daughter suffered from Dravet Syndrome, a life-threatening illness that causes severe seizures. She said cannabis oil treated her daughter's illness better than conventional medicine but she had to stop using it because it was illegal. ""We had actually tried the cannabis but unfortunately were unable to continue the treatment so she has regressed again,"" she said. ""We're just fighting now to get it legalised - we want it legal so we don't have any other repercussions. ""There's problems associated with it now for giving it to children."" She said it was exciting from a political standpoint and that the Queensland Government was recognising that. ""They're caring enough to put money in to be able to research to hopefully find not a cure, but to ease a lot of people's lives,"" she said.

80,Medicinal cannabis shares take a hit as market reality sets in,Tue 3 Mar 2020 at 1:09am," Medicinal cannabis shares take a hit as market reality sets in The medicinal cannabis industry has suffered a significant setback, with stock values plummeting as the product takes longer than expected to get to market. But at a secret location on the outskirts of Brisbane, one farm is about to harvest its first crop, raising hopes the fledgling industry could yet succeed. Emily Rigby, the director of research and compliance at Cannatrek, said its first crop was expected to supply around 4,000 patients.  ""The Government and the Office of Drug Control really underestimated the size of the Australian cannabis industry and they've been severely under-resourced,"" she said. ""And unfortunately, that has significantly slowed down the Australian cannabis industry."" One company that has listed on the stock exchange, Cann Group, has seen its share price slump about 50 per cent in the past six months. ""There's no doubt the bubble-bursting analogy is a good one,"" chief executive Peter Crock said. ""There was a lot of hype that had gone into that sector and promised the world, but as things settled down some realism has come in."" Mr Crock said the company had decided to slow the build of its major growing facility in north-west Victoria. ""With the slow down in the market and the pressures we saw internationally as well, we've decided to complete our Mildura project in a staged fashion now,"" he said. ""That allows us to better match the capital requirements with demand that we see coming out the other side of this."" Adelaide-based LeafCann is another company carefully watching the market; while it hasn't listed yet, chief executive Elisabetta Faenza says the correction is a good thing. ""There was so much money coming into the sector thinking it could make a fast buck,"" she said. ""And anyone who's had anything to do with the development of a medicine, you could not find a slower thing to get financial profitability than a pharmaceutical."" The Federal Government has approved the sale of medicinal marijuana, but it still won't be easy for people to get a prescription. Scott Phillips, the chief investment officer at financial advice firm Motley Fool, said the major companies had lost 50 to 80 per cent of their stockmarket value in the past year. ""We saw the medicinal cannabis and, frankly, recreational cannabis markets get kind of confused by speculators and investors; really, everyone wanted to get in on the pot boom,"" he said. ""Everyone wants to strike it rich. A few do, most don't."" That meant many companies would not survive, he added. ""We may well see some of them run out of money sooner rather than later. ""So that's a really big challenge — can they survive long enough to either show their model works, or wait until shares rise enough that investors want to tip more money in."" Ms Faenza said it would make attracting investment much more difficult. ""We just have to all work that much harder for every dollar now, so we're really positive about what's happening,"" she said. ""We're really excited that a lot of the gung-ho, not-so-reputable companies have been flushed out. I think that's a good thing for the market."" Ms Faenza said the industry's major bottleneck was in manufacturing, to be able to turn an illegal recreational drug into a pharmaceutical-grade drug. ""While there are people around the world producing probably very-high-quality plant matter, where it seems to be falling down is in extraction, which in many places has remained quite a cottage industry. ""We can make the best bud in the world, have the greatest genetics in the world, but if we can't extract it properly, consistently and in a stabilised format, then we don't have a medicine."" Christian Read insists while medical medicinal cannabis can't cure him of the pain he experiences, it grants him some relief. And without a reliable product, Ms Faenza said, doctors would not prescribe it and patients would not be interested in using it. ""The problem is that they vary from batch to batch — when you're talking about people with really severe conditions, the last thing they need is for it to work one month but not work the next."" But she said she was hopeful about the future for those dedicated to the industry. ""All of it has taken a lot longer than anyone would have liked, but it will be worth it and we're all so close now.""

81,"Medicinal cannabis driving plan inconsistent with road safety objectives, SA Police Minister says",Thu 6 Jul 2017 at 11:01pm," Medicinal cannabis driving plan inconsistent with road safety objectives, SA Police Minister says Plans to allow medicinal cannabis users to drive in South Australia have been labelled ""crazy"" by the Police Minister. The state's Upper House voted in favour of the amendment put forward by Dignity Party's Kelly Vincent to Labor's Drink and Drug Driving Bill yesterday. Ms Vincent said the proposal would only apply if a doctor said the motorist's driving would not be impaired by the prescribed medical treatment. Last year, the Federal Government legalised the prescription of medicinal cannabis and earlier this year South Australia slashed red tape allowing doctors to prescribe the treatment. ""It's no longer illicit to use medical cannabis, it is legal and we need to move this conversation forward so that we understand that a positive test does not always equal impairment,"" Ms Vincent said. ""We need to show trust in the medical profession that we trust their judgment when it comes to assessing  people as to whether they are fit to drive or not."" Greens MLC Mark Parnell said the amendment was not a ""get-out-of-jail-free card"" but it would give people the ability to go to court and explain their circumstances. Police Minister Peter Malinauskas attacked the ""good intentioned"" amendment and said it was ""inconsistent"" with road safety objectives and labelled it ""crazy"". ""It is getting to the point where more people are dying on our roads because of drug consumption than there are of drink drinking,"" he said. ""So this needs a response, hence the Government has opened up the act and [are] making a number of changes."" It's been a long time coming but we're finally investigating (scientifically) the medicinal properties of marijuana. Currently, drug testing only detects the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in a person's system and not the amount like alcohol testing. He said the Government supported the medical treatment but needed to keep road users safe. ""Our objective here is to make sure that people who get behind a wheel of a car have their brain operating in such a way that doesn't cause a risk to everyone else on the road,"" Mr Malinauskas said. ""What we know from a range of research from around the world [is] that ... any consumption of cannabis that results in THC being in your system impairs your ability to drive and therefore you shouldn't be getting behind the wheel of a car and putting every other road user at risk."" Mr Malinaukas said not all medicinal cannabis had THC but many did. He also said some people might decide to take greater doses of the drug than the prescribed amount.

82,Medicinal marijuana research at University of Sydney receives record $33m donation from Barry and Joy Lambert,Fri 12 Jun 2015 at 3:19am," Medicinal marijuana research at University of Sydney receives record $33m donation from Barry and Joy Lambert The University of Sydney has received its largest ever research donation with $33 million given to fund medicinal cannabinoid research. Businessman Barry Lambert and his wife Joy today gave the university the funding which is expected to place Australia at the forefront of advances in medical marijuana research. Mr Lambert said the donation was inspired by their granddaughter who lives with epilepsy. ""The experience of our granddaughter ... has opened our eyes to the extraordinary possibilities of cannabinoids treating not only her condition but a range of chronic illnesses that often don't respond to conventional treatments,"" Mr Lambert said. ""We believe this investment in the future of Australian science and medicine will provide the much-needed evidence to rapidly advance the use of medicinal cannabinoids in the treatment of childhood epilepsy and other serious illnesses."" A priority of the funding is researching how cannabinoids work to treat paediatric epilepsy. Dr Michael Spence, vice-chancellor of the University of Sydney, said the contribution will also enable research for a range of uses including addiction, cancer and obesity. ""[This is] a world-first in the extent of support for medicinal cannabis research,"" Dr Spence said. ""[The donation] places Australia in the front rank of countries, such as the Netherlands, the United states and Israel, leading the world in this new era of cannabinoid science,"" he said. NSW Premier Mike Baird said the state is breaking new ground in medical marijuana research. ""The Lamberts' investment gives our case enormous momentum and my hopes is it dramatically increases the cross-sector knowledge sharing required to ultimately produce cannabinoid-based medicines that are safe, reliable and affordable,"" Mr Baird said.

83,"Medicinal cannabis not likely to be a big export for Australia, says major Canadian player",Mon 15 Jan 2018 at 4:45am,"ABC Rural Medicinal cannabis not likely to be a big export for Australia, says major Canadian player A major player in the global cannabis market says Australia is not likely to become a big producer of cannabis.  The Federal Government recently approved the export of medicinal cannabis products such as oils, sprays, tablets and patches. But Brendan Kennedy, president of Canadian cannabis producer, Tilray, said the potential for Australia to export the raw material was limited. ""Countries such as Columbia and the Congo, any country around the equator has geographic advantages [and] while the price per kilogram of this product today is very high at the moment, at some point it will start to look like other agricultural products,"" he said. The venture capitalist set up Privateer Holding in 2010, which bought Canadian firm Tilray, to get a foothold in the medicinal cannabis market. Tilray now exports to eight countries and has a $30 million cultivation plant in Portugal. Mr Kennedy said the global market for recreational cannabis was already $200 billion and the medicinal cannabis market was likely to grow quickly.  ""I think it will be around a $100 billion opportunity over the next five to 10 years,"" he said. ""If you look at the number of countries that allow medical cannabis it's about 30 today and I would expect that to grow to about 40 by the end of this year."" The Federal Government's announcement means finished medicinal cannabis products, such as cannabis oil and cannabis flowers or 'bud', will be permitted for export but bulk raw material for processing elsewhere in the world will not. Narcotics are not a 'commodity good' under the United Nation's Single Convention of Narcotic Drugs and the production and trade is limited to ensure there is an adequate supply of medicines but not enough for a stockpile to build up or get diverted for non-medicinal uses. A spokesperson for the Department of Health said ""the decision addresses an imbalance for the local industry following the bulk import of cannabis products to meet existing demand"". ""Exports will allow the local industry to develop scales of production that will, ultimately, deliver benefits to Australian patients in the same way it has built large industries on grains and mineral exports."" Tilray is involved in four different trials of medicinal cannabis products in Australia, involving cancer and epilepsy patients and the impact of cannabinoids on oral health, users' ability to drive, and their emotional response to the drug. But when it comes to cultivation, the company has backed away from Australia saying the demand here is not enough to warrant it. ""We're seeing positive signs [but] it's just not as large as we anticipated,"" Mr Kennedy said. ""It's one of the reasons we didn't invest in a cultivation facility in Australia."" Mr Kennedy thought Australia could succeed in the global pharmaceutical market because of the strict standards here and the government focus on research, and that was probably where Australian companies would need to focus. ""The Australian industry as a whole will have to be focussed on medical uses of cannabis in order to be successful,"" he said. Tilray also has a commercial agreement with Bob Marley's family. The reggae singer made marijuana use famous in the 1970s, and Tilray has an agreement to produce Marley products for the recreational market when it becomes legal in Canada later this year.

84,Medicinal cannabis market offers new opportunities for agriculture,Wed 22 Feb 2017 at 5:47am,"ABC Rural Medicinal cannabis market offers new opportunities for agriculture Twenty-five companies have applied for licences to grow and manufacture medicinal cannabis in Australia.  Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt announced today medical marijuana could be easier to import to Australia, if requested through a doctor, by fast-tracking importation while local supplies expand. Meanwhile the Victoria Government has harvested its first crop and approved a trial to test its effectiveness of cannabis a treatment for epilepsy. Medical marijuana is already a rapidly growing business in Israel, the United States and Canada and many of those global companies are now positioning themselves for entry here. The domestic market for medicinal cannabis is worth an estimated $100m/year and with raw material difficult and expensive to import there is plenty of interest. The problem for small scale farmers is that medicinal cannabis probably will not be grown as a broad acre crop like poppies.  For security and production reasons most companies are applying to grow in glasshouses. WA firm AusCann re-listed on the stock market earlier this month and raised a rapid $5million to finance their growing plans. The company is part-owned by Canadian giant Canpopy Growth Corporation, the world's biggest  producer of medicinal cannabis. AusCann CEO Elaine Darby said that relationship provided it with genetics and pharmaceutical knowledge but now it had to wait for Federal Government licence approval before proceeding. Subscribe to Rural RoundUp: Stories from rural and regional Australia, every Friday. ""They have the fit and proper person test … not only your board of directors, all of your employees, anyone you associate with all have to have full police clearance."" AusCann has contracted a security firm to do a security assessment required for all manufacturing and cultivation operations to reduce the risk of medicinal cannabis being diverted to the black market.  Ms Darby said they planned to use glasshouses with retractable roofs partly for security but also to maximise the growing conditions. ""If you grow this plant in Australia outdoors you only get one crop, but if you can artificially light you can get three, maybe four crops a year out of them."" She said the company was looking at a site ""not too far out of Perth"". Whatever is grown in Australia will have to be processed and packaged as medicine. A small pharmaceutical company based in Melbourne is involved in preparing medicinal cannabis for two medical trials under way in NSW. For security reasons they cannot be identified but the chief executive said there was a lot of interest in growing cannabis in Australia because importing it is difficult. ""There are issues around importation and the speed with which these materials can be brought in because you need import permits both into Australia but also the shipping country also needs an export permit. ""These can take anywhere between 30-60 days so it makes it difficult to transport these products between countries."" He said there were are opportunities for seed companies to develop seed stocks and for companies involved in extracting oil as that is used in the production of pharmaceutical products. He said there were two approaches people were taking with production. ""There is the super critical extraction with CO2 extractors which tend to produce a consistent product and don't have the issue of high solvent volumes.  ""The other more traditional [method] is ethanol extraction or solvent extraction and this really comes down to the volume of material you are handling. ""CO2 has a lot of up-front costs cause the equipment is expensive while ethanol has some issues around handling and volumes but equipment wise has a lower set up cost."" The head of the Victorian company granted the first Australian cannabis research licence said medical marijuana had the potential to be a significant industry in the state. The licence was granted to Melbourne-based company Cann Group after the first successful harvest of a Victorian Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources cannabis crop. Cann Group chairman Allan McCallum is a former GrainCorp director. Mr McCallum said his company had a licence to research the medicinal qualities of the plant to optimise the levels of cannabinoids, improve growing conditions or undertake pre-clinical research in animals and would now need to apply for a permit for cultivation. He said the company expected to be able to start growing the crop within two to four weeks if it was granted. ""We'd probably be six to 12 months away from commercial production,"" he said. He said trials with a low-THC cannabis variety had been successful. ""We think we've got our growing techniques down pat,"" he said. ""Keeping mind this is all hydroponic and indoors and in pretty secure facilities.""

85,Medicinal cannabis could be legally available by 2016,"October 13, 2015 — 7.39am","We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 7 years ago Medicinal cannabis could be legally grown and prescribed to patients as early as next year under a cross party bill that has attracted initial support from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Greens leader, senator Richard Di Natale, announced on Monday that the bill to create a regulator for medicinal cannabis for certain conditions had been drafted and would be put before the Senate for a vote in November. While Victoria and NSW state governments had indicated that they wanted to legalise medicinal cannabis, a federal regulatory scheme was required to do this: ""We need national laws to make sure we can licence growers … that doctors can prescribe this and that the medication gets in the hands of patients who need it."" If passed, there was ""no reason"" Australia could not begin importing medicinal cannabis and make it available for patients next year, ahead of creating a locally grown industry for the drug. Medicinal cannabis my soon be legalised in Australia.Credit:Max Mason Hubers The drug could be prescribed for certain conditions where there was ""overwhelming evidence"" of its effectiveness, including stopping muscle spasms from multiple sclerosis, and as an appetite stimulant for some terminal illnesses. States and territories that opted in to the regulatory scheme would be required to amend their respective criminal laws to exclude medicinal cannabis. The move follows a Senate committee in August giving its unanimous endorsement for the bill - which was introduced into Parliament last November.  Coalition senator Ian MacDonald, who chaired the committee, said Mr Turnbull and Health Minister Sussan Ley ""are totally supportive to the concept"" of legalising medicinal cannabis. Federal Greens leader Richard Di Natale.Credit:Chris Hopkins While the Department of Health still had concerns over ""technical details"" in the proposed law, he said: ""We must get a resolution which provides this relief at the soonest possible time."" Health Minister Sussan Ley said the Turnbull government was ""incredibly sympathetic"" to the plight of those suffering chronic pain and illnesses ""and we want to ensure they get access to the most effective medical treatments available"". Asked whether she supported the proposed bill to legalise medicinal cannabis, Ms Ley said she would consider the Senate committee's recommendations and continue to discuss them with her parliamentary colleagues. ""We must ensure any therapeutic product, including medicinal cannabis, is not only a safe and effective treatment for public use, but also meets our strict international obligations safe-guarding its manufacture and distribution for medical purposes only,"" she said. Labor senator Anne Urquhart, who will co-sponsor the bill, said people were already risking criminal charges to use the drug: ""We still need to trial some of these substances and [also] make sure that people are safe from criminality and that we have a safe, effective and affordable system where people can access medicinal cannabis."" Their comments were echoed by Liberal senator Sharman Stone, Labor senator Melissa Parke and Liberal Democrat senator David Leyonhjelm. Lucy Haslam, a key campaigner for the legalisation of medical marijuana said on Monday there were existing overseas regulation models that could be drawn on without delay. ""We've got to get past the rhetoric and fallacies … that have surrounded medicinal cannabis for so many years,"" she said. Ms Haslam's son, Dan, used medical cannabis to relieve the nausea and vomiting he experienced as he underwent chemotherapy. Mr Haslam, 25, died earlier this year. ""This is what the Australian people need. They needed it yesterday. It's too late for my son but it's not too late for thousands of others in Australia."" Senator Di Natale said that they had not worked out how much it would cost to establish a regulator. They were continuing to draft the bill to ensure the regulatory scheme complied with Australia's obligations under international treaties. Follow us on Twitter Copyright © 2023",8,651
86,Woman sources 'home-grown' medicinal cannabis through her church after year-long effort to obtain it legally fails,Sat 13 Apr 2019 at 11:24pm," Woman sources 'home-grown' medicinal cannabis through her church after year-long effort to obtain it legally fails At 89 years old, a suicidal Olive Wraight walked into her church in Bunbury, south of Perth, and asked her congregation a compromising question: ""I need medicinal cannabis. Can anyone help me?"" She had heard whispers that some of the congregation had used medicinal cannabis for pain, and it had greatly improved their quality of life. It's not something Ms Wraight thought she would have to resort to. For more than a year, she tried accessing medicinal cannabis through legal channels, with no luck. She's one of an estimated 100,000 people who are using 'home-grown' cannabis products to treat medical problems. ""The base of my skull to the end of my spine is totally compromised with fractures, collapsed discs and herniated discs,"" she said. ""I know pain. I have lived in pain constantly. ""I was about to give up my life because I simply could not continue to live the way I was."" Ms Wraight had been treating her worsening chronic pain with an ever increasing cocktail of pharmaceutical drugs, including opioids, for 15 years. But five months ago, after the sermon, someone put her in touch with a supplier. Her pharmaceutical pain relief was replaced with cannabis oil, and more recently cannabis pills, of which she takes two daily.  ""Within two days I was feeling the difference between that and my other medications,"" she said.  ""By the end of the week I was sold on it. I have never felt this good in years."" In theory there are two legal avenues Ms Wraight could pursue to obtain medicinal cannabis. One option is to find a doctor who is an authorised prescriber (AP) of a specific cannabis medicine. To become an AP, however, a medical practitioner must complete a rigorous application process. It includes getting approval from the Therapeutic Goods Association (TGA), obtaining endorsement from an ethics committee, and checking for additional state or territory requirements. According to the TGA there were 57 authorised prescribers across Australia as of March 31. But privacy laws prevent patients from being able to search for an AP. A TGA spokeswoman said the association would not disclose how many APs were active in Western Australia. The second pathway is to find a GP willing to make an application for Commonwealth and state approval, under the Special Access Scheme B, in an online application. Since its inception there have been 5,200 approvals via 600 doctors through the scheme; 500 of those approvals occurred in Western Australia. Ms Wraight said she had found it impossible to find either an AP or a GP willing to make an application to the TGA. Sanjay Nijhawan of Cannabis Access Clinics said there were two components in GPs' apprehension to prescribe. ""One of course is the lengthy process, which takes time and effort, and obviously Medicare does not reward that appropriately for the length of time you would spend on the patient,"" Dr Nijhawan said. ""Number two of course is the lack of understanding of how medical cannabis actually works."" WA Health Minister Roger Cook agreed there was a limited appreciation of medicinal cannabis in the state's primary care community.  ""We're very much in the early days of understanding the impact of cannabinoids and their benefits for people suffering from a range of conditions,"" he said.  ""Many doctors have said to me they'd be happy to prescribe cannabis-based medicines if they knew how much to prescribe and how long to prescribe it for. ""That's one of the mysteries we're still just getting to understand."" Ms Wraight said another roadblock in accessing the drug legally was the cost. Medicinal cannabis is not on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme so patients need to pay full price for products they are prescribed. For a month's supply of cannabis pills, Ms Wraight pays between $80 and $100. She said if she bought the product through a pharmacist, she could be paying up to $450 a month. ""It's a whole lot cheaper to buy it from the black market than it is to buy legally,"" she said. ""It's driving people underground and they're getting so fed up they're getting their supply wherever they can get it."" The affordability of medicines prompted Mr Cook to raise the issue with Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt. ""I wrote to him last year to ask him to consider utilising the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme as a way of providing price or cost relief to patients,"" Mr Cook said. ""What he pointed out to me is that you can only use the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme once a drug has got TGA approval and once we understand better the impact for the patient. ""As other products come on the market you can see the increasing downward pressure on that price and hopefully they'll become more affordable."" Mr Cook urged Western Australians to be patient and ""resist the temptation"" of sourcing medicinal cannabis illegally. ""Don't trust them unless they are an approved supplier with Australian accreditation,"" he said. ""We know community sentiment is running ahead of the medical science on this. ""We are moving as quickly as possible so people don't feel tempted to buy online, to pick up some dodgy product from somewhere else."" But for users like Ms Wraight, waiting is not an option. ""It's impossible to do this properly,"" she said.  ""I'm 89 years old. I'm not going to be around for much longer.  ""To live with my pain is absolutely demoralising. ""As long as I keep taking this, I am completely out of pain.""

87,"Cannabis treatment for sick dogs lags behind US, but Colorado expert urges caution",Mon 31 May 2021 at 7:35pm," Cannabis treatment for sick dogs lags behind US, but Colorado expert urges caution Paddy is a 15-year-old golden retriever, much loved but slow on his legs. He is on medication for arthritis and has to have blood tests every six months to check for kidney damage — a common side effect. ""It can also cause vomiting, but he's OK, as long as he gets fed a lot,"" his owner Della Stevens said. ""We give him one tablet at night and he deals with it alright. Without it, he'd really struggle to get up and down."" It is still an oddity in Australia but in many US states, medicinal cannabis medications including tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) — the psychoactive component in cannabis — are being used as a treatment for pets with conditions such as arthritis and epilepsy.  It is a big and growing business.  According to US market research firm Brightfield Group, consumers spent $US426 million ($A551m) last year on pet products containing medicinal cannabis of some kind.  That number is expected to jump to $US629 million ($A814m) by the end of this year and $US1.1 billion ($A1.4b) by 2025.  Stephanie McGrath from Colorado State University is a veterinary neurologist who has conducted clinical trials using medicinal cannabis to treat seizures in dogs. One study looked at the effect on 16 dogs who were being treated with standard anti-convulsive therapy. Nine received cannabinoids (CBD) – compounds found in cannabis — and THC while seven were given placebos. ""It was very promising,"" Dr McGrath said. ""We showed a significant decrease in seizure activity between the treatment group and the placebo group."" The study also found that the dogs that absorbed CBD at a greater rate also had the greatest reduction in seizures. ""It really gave us a lot of hope that CBD might be a promising anti-convulsive for companion animals,"" Dr McGrath said. ""In the US there's an FDA-approved medicine for children with epilepsy and it was exciting to show that it may have a very similar effect in dogs as well."" The CBD treatment also came without the liver disease and pancreatitis that can accompany anti-convulsive therapies. A previous study looking at the effectiveness of medicinal cannabis on osteoarthritis in dogs was less convincing, but Dr McGrath is lining up another project to look at that nexus again later this year.   An Australian medicinal cannabis company that sources some of its raw materials from Tasmania, Auscann, recently completed a clinical trial in the US that looked at 46 dogs with osteoarthritis. The randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial tested the effects of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) — the psychoactive compound in cannabis — and CBD on the mood, pain and lameness of the dogs over eight weeks. The company told the Australian Securities Exchange: ""A total reduction in veterinary lameness scoring was observed in all dogs treated with CPAT-01, showing improvement over time, which was numerically better for treated dogs compared with placebo."" Some hemp-based products, which include very low levels of THC and do not affect an animal's mental state, are available in Australia.  But the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority has not approved a single medicinal cannabis product for veterinary use in Australia and, in a statement, said that before any were authorised they would have to meet the statutory criteria, including safety and efficacy. Not much, as it turns out, unless they eat a lot of other dangerous stuff as well. Cannabis is legal in Colorado for recreational purposes as well as medical treatment. Professor of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine Tim Hackett, also from Colorado State University, has treated hundreds of animals brought in with marijuana toxicity after eating their owner's stash. He said after Colorado legalised cannabis use, the number of dogs admitted to the ED went from a handful a year to almost one a day. ""This is a dog problem; cats don't eat this stuff,"" Dr Hackett said.   ""A human will know to stop after one gummy bear, but a dog will eat as much as they can, and then they come in with a range of systems from mildly impaired to unconscious and barely able to breathe. ""For the most part, they recover pretty well. ""But we've had the occasional very rare case where they're so impaired they get the rock star problem when they've had too many drugs and then they choke on their own vomit."" Eating too much oil, which is often used as a carrier for medicinal cannabis, can also cause pancreatitis and death. Although medicines containing marijuana are available for pets over the counter in many US states there is still very little research to prove their therapeutic benefits. ""We still don't understand things like, how much do you dose the dog to get a similar level as you get in a person?"" Dr Hackett said. ""They have very different metabolic rates and they handle things differently. A single paracetamol in a cat can be fatal. ""We're really in unknown territory because the pharmacokinetics (how the body deals with medication) still haven't been done."" As for Ms Stevens, she's open-minded about cannabis treatments. ""If it didn't have the side effects, like the damage to the kidneys, I'd give it a go,"" she said.

The State Government said the Public Health (Medicinal Cannabis) Bill 2016 provided a legitimate pathway for Queensland patients of any age and with a range of conditions to access legal medicinal cannabis products. The laws give certain specialists such as oncologists, paediatric neurologists and palliative care specialists the right to prescribe medicinal cannabis from March next year. Federal Government Medicinal cannabis use is still illegal and only available through trials and limited special access schemes. But, earlier this year, the Federal Government passed legislation legalising the cultivation of cannabis for medicinal purposes. Queensland Queensland doctors will soon be able to prescribe it for their patients' treatment. New laws will give certain specialists including oncologists, paediatric neurologists and palliative care specialists the right to prescribe medicinal cannabis from March 2017. Other doctors would be able to apply to Queensland Health for permission to prescribe the drug for patients with certain conditions. Tasmania The State Government announced specialist medical practitioners would be allowed to prescribe the drug to patients suffering serious and chronic illness from 2017. NSW In July, NSW Premier Mike Baird said 40 children in the state with the most severe cases of drug-resistant epilepsy would now have access to a cannabis-based treatment under a compassionate access scheme. NSW is conducting a trial for patients suffering vomiting and nausea as a result of chemotherapy. Western Australia The WA Government previously said it would not conduct medicinal cannabis trials until it received the results of testing in New South Wales. Northern Territory Not legal. South Australia In April, SA Health Minister Jack Snelling ruled out changing the law in South Australia at this stage. Victoria It's legal. It was the first state to pass legislation legalising the use of medicinal cannabis. Other doctors, including GPs, would be able to apply to Queensland Health for permission to prescribe the drug for patients with certain conditions. The bill was passed unanimously with Opposition and crossbench support. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the legislation was a milestone for those who had campaigned tirelessly for changes. ""My Government has been moved by the stories of families with young children with epilepsy, suffering life-threatening seizures, and what they have to go through on a daily basis,"" she said. Health Minister Cameron Dick said the bill provided a legitimate pathway for people who had been forced to seek illicit cannabis treatment options.  ""Queensland is leading Australia in providing a pathway to access medicinal cannabis treatment for those who need it most, in a safe, controlled way,"" he said. Mr Dick said other patients could also access the drugs under the regulations in the interim until the laws are enacted in March 2017. He said the Queensland laws were now the most flexible in the country. LNP spokesman Steve Dickson told the house of pleas from his constituents for change — including Jai Whitelaw and his ""courageous mum Michelle"".  ""[She] told me Jai went through up to 500 seizures a day, to four seizures in the past 15 months, by using whole plant medicinal cannabis,"" he said. The bill will be reviewed after two years.  The use of medicinal cannabis would be integrated into patient treatment plans and overseen by a medical practitioner, to ensure the right monitoring and controls were in place. The use of cannabis without the appropriate approvals would continue to be illegal in Queensland. Chair of Health Consumers Queensland, Mark Tucker-Evans, welcomed the changes. ""We look forward to Queenslanders having the legal means to access medicinal cannabis products where they may be of benefit,"" he said. There is currently only one patient who is legally using medicinal cannabis in Queensland. Approval was given earlier this year for a teenager at Loganholme, south of Brisbane, to use cannabis oil capsules to treat a brain tumour.  The patient was allowed to use the drug under changes made last year to the Health (Drugs and Poisons) Regulation Act. However, Steve Peek, who uses cannabis oil on his dying eight-year-old daughter Suli to relieve her seizures, said the laws would not solve their problems. He said legal cannabis oil was too expensive and was not on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). ""The fact that we need something now — we can't stop using the product we're using,"" he said. ""There's nothing else available and what we're doing is still illegal and we still can't take her to the hospital."" Cannabis oil advocate Rebecca Brisdon said the changes did not go far enough. ""The people I help haven't got til March next year to wait for this — the Government are well aware of that,"" she said.  ""Yes, I'm grateful that there is legislation coming in through. Do I believe that this is the best this Government could have done — No.   ""Do I believe these patients still need an amnesty — Yes."" Civil libertarians want the Queensland Government to work towards establishing a local industry to supply medicinal cannabis. Queensland Council for Civil Liberties spokesman Michael Cope said the legislation would be of no use if steps were not taken to secure a supply. ""Our understanding is it's extremely difficult to get hold of because it's only manufactured in a few countries and it's being sold into other markets,"" he said. ""I wouldn't be surprised that it would be extremely expensive - it's a simple case of supply and demand."" There are limited medicinal cannabis schemes in New South Wales and Victoria.  Internationally, medicinal cannabis has been approved for use in Austria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Israel, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden and the United States.

91,"Easing of rules around driving on medicinal cannabis a priority, Andrews says","February 28, 2023 — 5.35pm","We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. Premier Daniel Andrews has given his strongest indication yet that the state’s strict rules around driving after using medicinal cannabis will be overhauled. It is an offence for Victorians to drive with any trace of psychoactive cannabis in their system or when impaired by any prescription medication, according to VicRoads. Penalties for drug-driving include mandatory licence suspension. Premier Daniel Andrews in Box Hill on Tuesday. Credit:Joe Armao Andrews said on Tuesday that allowing unimpaired Victorians to drive after taking medicinal cannabis was a significant priority for his government. “In terms of drug law reform, the issue that I’m much more focused on is those Victorians – and there can be as many as 200,000 – who are currently using medicinal cannabis with a script from a doctor and they cannot drive,” he said at a press conference at Box Hill High School. “That’s an issue that’s bedevilled us. We need to find a way through that.” The premier said he didn’t want anyone to avoid alleviating pain or other symptoms because they were too scared to take what had been prescribed to them. “I don’t want them to feel they can’t access that care because we don’t have [updated] drug-driving laws and we don’t have a test that can test for impairment,” he said. “You’re either positive [to traces of the psychoactive tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC] or negative. It’s a binary thing when you may not be impaired at all. So we’re working through that.” Changing the rules around medicinal cannabis use and driving was canvassed during the last term of parliament, but never eventuated. The Legalise Cannabis Party – which alongside the Greens holds the balance of power in the upper house on legislation that the Coalition and right-wing crossbenchers oppose – has a bill before the Legislative Council on the issue. David Ettershank from the Legalise Cannabis Party has welcomed the premier’s comments.Credit:Paul Jeffers It seeks to treat medicinal cannabis like other prescription medications when it comes to driving. In other words, it would allow people to drive if they are not impaired. Victoria became the first state to approve medicinal cannabis in 2016. Unlike in Tasmania, there is no exemption for unimpaired drivers. David Ettershank, one of two upper house MPs from Legalise Cannabis, said he welcomed the premier’s comments. “Legalise Cannabis Victoria is currently having discussions with a number of government ministers about this and other questions,” he said. The party’s bill is scheduled for debate next Wednesday. Cannabis has two main chemical components. THC is the psychoactive ingredient, responsible for giving people the “high” feeling. Cannabidiol, or CBD, does not have the same psychoactive effect. Both are used in different levels as treatments for various conditions, including cancer-related symptoms, anxiety and neurological disorders.

92,Mining billionaire Gina Rinehart goes green with $15m medical cannabis play,"June 22, 2021 — 3.43pm","We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. This was published 1 year ago Iron ore magnate and cattle queen Gina Rinehart has added medicinal cannabis to her portfolio as she invests $15 million into the European expansion of a Perth-based company in the growing industry. Ms Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting was the cornerstone in a $27.2 million capital raising by WA’s Little Green Pharma for the purchase of an existing cultivation and manufacturing site in regional Denmark which already has European licences for creating medical products. Iron ore magnate Gina Rinehart’s company Hancock Prospecting is getting into pot stocks. Credit:WAtoday Hancock Prospecting gets a 10 per cent stake in Little Green Pharma out of the deal, which was announced on Tuesday to the ASX. The purchase of the facility brings forward Little Green Pharma’s expansion plans into Europe by two years and will see its annual cultivation capacity go up immediately from three tonnes of biomass at its existing West Australian facility to a total of 23 tonnes of which 12 tonnes is dried cannabis flower. The blooming medicinal cannabis industry is highly regulated internationally but Little Green Pharma, founded in 2016, has managed to sell products in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, New Zealand, and Brazil. The Perth company also recently announced a Polish distribution partner. Medicinal cannabis industry researcher FreshLeaf Analytics has projected Australian revenue from medicinal cannabis would double in 2021, compared to last year, to $200 million. Hancock Prospecting business development general manager Dan Wade said the company wanted to help thousands of Australians and overseas patients access cannabis medicines. “We believe medicinal cannabis has a vital role in helping to treat a range of chronic conditions, and we’re pleased to support an Australian medicinal cannabis company in Little Green Pharma that continues to put patients first and contribute to the development of this helpful and emerging industry,” he said. Little Green Pharma managing director Fleta Solomon said it was well positioned to capitalise on its brand equity in Europe and Australia with the new facility. “The Denmark facility provides more than eight times the capacity of our previous planned production expansion,” she said. “Purchasing the Denmark facility provides both cost and time savings and was a preferable option to building out production capacity at our existing facility. “We’ll keep our foot on our Australian property for longer term growth but are now able to redeploy the significant capex investment we had planned.” Medicinal cannabis is riding on a high but Ms Rinehart’s coal mining dreams in Canada have taken a hit after environmental regulators recommended the Trudeau government put a halt to the proposal for the Grassy Mountain open-cut mine in Alberta. The flagship project of Riversdale Resources, a company taken over by Hancock Prospecting in 2019 for more than $600 million, would produce about 93 million tonnes of coal over a 23-year mine life and have a 1521 hectare footprint. About 500 jobs would be created during construction of the project and 385 full-time jobs in production. A joint review panel acting on behalf of the Alberta Energy Regulator has denied permit applications related to the mine under provincial law and recommended to Canada’s environment minister on Thursday that the project should not go ahead. Alberta Energy Regulator chief executive Laurie Pushor said the panel’s decision reflected the regulator’s commitment to making evidence-based and risk-informed decisions in the public interest. The final report from the panel stated there would have a significant impact on the environment and the traditional activities of Indigenous people. “Based on our assessment, we conclude that the project is likely to result in significant adverseenvironmental effects on surface water quality, westslope cutthroat trout and their habitat, whitebark pine, rough fescue grasslands, and vegetation species and community biodiversity,” it said. “We also find that the project is likely to contribute to existing significant adverse cumulative environmental effects on westslope cutthroat trout, little brown bats, grizzly bears, and whitebark pine. “We find that the project would result in low to moderate positive economic impacts on the regionaleconomy.” The company is exploring its legal options.

93,"First legal, commercial medicinal cannabis shipment now in Australia",3 May 2017,"The first two commercial shipments of medicinal cannabis products to be legally imported to Australia have arrived in Melbourne and Perth. It means that if you already have approval to use medicinal cannabis, you no longer have to wait for the product you need to be imported. Until now, medicinal cannabis was imported into Australia on a case-by-case basis. Each bottle of the drug was destined for a specific patient. Now pharmacists are able to stockpile the drug for anyone with a prescription.  But actually getting that prescription can be a slow process, and sometimes take months, depending on the state where you apply.  The arrival of the shipment will make doctors more likely to prescribe the drug, and could ultimately lead to a streamlining of the approvals process, according to Paul Mavor, Director of Health House International, one of the two businesses that received a shipment from Canada on Tuesday.  ""It's sensational to be able to get the products that are there to help people, some of whom have no other treatment options,"" Paul told Hack. We've had a couple hundred emails just today."" Federal legislation came into effect in October last year which the Government said would ""give patients and doctors access to a safe, reliable and legal source of cannabis."" The Government began accepting applications to grow cannabis, but cultivation has been slow to scale up and the case-by-case process of importing cannabis was convoluted. Patients demanded urgent access to the drug. In February, advocates wrote letters to the Federal Government urging it to come up with a way of making imports easier. ""I wrote the Government a letter explaining these medicines are for patients who need them urgently and there was no continuity of supply,"" Paul said. ""They made the changes pretty much straightaway."" Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt set up an interim scheme to fast track importation of cannabis. He promised the the imports would be available in eight weeks. Just under ten weeks later, the first shipment has arrived. The 60ml bottles of medicinal grade oil come from Canada in three different strengths to suit different illnesses. ""We couldn't have got the medical cannabis product any earlier,"" Paul said. ""The Canadian Government had quite a few barriers in place to exporting medicinal cannabis."" The drug arrived in Australia on Monday, according to the Department of Health. The other shipment went to Melbourne's Pharmaceutical Packaging Professionals. Thirty permits have been granted to import cannabis products from Canada, Switzerland and the Netherlands. More shipments are expected to arrive through May. ""The first shipment was the hardest but here on it will get a whole lot easier,"" Paul said. The Therapeutic Goods Act (TGA) doesn't specify which illnesses might be eligible for special access to medicinal cannabis. Doctors need to be able to show the drug would be of benefit for a patient. States and territories can make access available to specific types of patients. Paul Mavor said there was solid medical evidence this week's shipment of cannabis oil could be used for treating three main conditions: He said there was also evidence for treating epilepsy with cannabis, and other conditions may soon qualify as authorities become satisfied the drug is safe and effective. Medicinal cannabis has been made available to children with severe epilepsy in Victoria.  A Department of Health statement said ""children suffering from epilepsy and patients dealing with side effects caused by cancer treatment"" are most likely to benefit from the medicinal cannabis products that arrived this week. Last year, Hack spoke to Lindsay Carter who had imported medicinal cannabis products from Canada to treat his seizures and nausea caused by brain tumours. There's two ways. Doctors can apply to become ""authorised prescribers"" of medicinal cannabis to patients with particular medical conditions. From this week, patients can go to pharmacies supplied by wholesalers such as Health House International to fill the prescription. In March, South Australian MPs called access to medicinal cannabis a ""mirage"" because, even though it was technically legal, the state did not yet have a single doctor authorised to prescribe. Hack reported in March there were only 23 authorised prescribers in Australia. The other way of getting access is for doctors to apply for medicinal marijuana on behalf of their patients through the ""Special Access Scheme"". But these methods only cover federal approval to access the drug. In some states you need to get separate state approval. ""At the moment access is difficult and quite convoluted,"" Paul said. ""It's a real patchwork quilt of laws. Some of the state approvals are really a duplication of the federal approvals.  ""In the case of Western Australia they've got really unfair hurdles that requires patients two months to navigate."" He hopes the approvals process will become more streamlined as more doctors become authorised prescribers and patients report the benefits of the drug.

94,Medicinal cannabis trial: Michael Ferguson signals support for 'appropriately conducted clinical research',Mon 8 Sep 2014 at 1:16am," Medicinal cannabis trial: Michael Ferguson signals support for 'appropriately conducted clinical research' Growing trials for medicinal cannabis may be allowed in Tasmanian after the State Government changed its earlier position. Health Minister Michael Ferguson has told a parliamentary committee the Government would support ""appropriately conducted clinical research."" The shift in the Government's stance has been labelled a backflip by Greens MP Cassy O'Connor. In July, Mr Ferguson rejected a bid for a trial in Tasmania, telling proponents he was concerned about security and the potential for social harm. The Upper House has since launched an inquiry into medicinal cannabis. Mr Ferguson has revealed he made a written submission to the inquiry stating he would support a trial under the right circumstances. ""We do support appropriately conducted clinical research to allow any claims of that nature to be tested, in the correct and robust way, in an evidence-based robust fashion, where it is science not politics that determines what new medicines enter the legal drug supply in Australia,"" he said. ""We will objectively consider any proposal regarding a trial of medicinal cannabis on a case-by-case basis."" The Greens' Cassy O'Connor described the move as a welcome backflip.  ""For those Tasmanians who are suffering from chronic conditions, or the after affects of chemotherapy, to hear that the health minister of Tasmania has bowed to significant public pressure and left the door open to a trial is a very positive development,"" she said.   We will objectively consider any proposal regarding a trial of medicinal cannabis on a case-by-case basis. In July, the mother of an eight-year-old girl who stopped having seizures after taking medicinal cannabis accused Mr Ferguson of not doing his research. ""I don't think my daughter's health should be limited by a small number of politicians who maybe haven't done their research,"" she said. But Mr Ferguson said his Government had never ruled out a medicinal cannabis industry. ""Our Government is in actual fact very compassionate and sincerely compassionate in wishing to respond to this, particularly for those Tasmanians and their loved ones who believe that this is their answer for their medical condition,"" he said. The company that made the initial proposal to the State Government, Tasman Health Cannabinoids (THC), took its proposal to Norfolk Island after it was rejected by Tasmania. Norfolk Island's Government initially accepted the proposal only to have it overturned by the island's administrator, former Liberal MP Gary Hardgrave in August. Shortly after Mr Hardgrave's veto of the operation, Mr Ferguson said it ""vindicated"" his initial stance. ""I think it does vindicate the approach the Tasmanian Government has taken,"" he said at the time. THC is yet to comment, but had indicated it would be open to revisiting its proposal to the Tasmanian Government were to change its stance. CEO Troy Langman had said Tasmania was his preferred choice because of its climate.

95,"Medicinal cannabis 'a miracle' treatment for my daughter, mum tells Tas inquiry",Thu 18 Sep 2014 at 1:03am," Medicinal cannabis 'a miracle' treatment for my daughter, mum tells Tas inquiry A Tasmanian mother has told a parliamentary inquiry how medicinal cannabis has miraculously improved the health of her nine-year-old daughter who suffers from a rare genetic disorder.  Nicole Cowles was the first person to address the Tasmanian Upper House inquiry into legalised medicinal cannabis, which began public hearings today. The inquiry, chaired by independent MP Ruth Forrest, was set up after Health Minister Michael Ferguson knocked back a proposal for a medicinal cannabis trial in Tasmania's Huon Valley in July. Ms Cowles said she used the drug to control the severe seizures that had afflicted her daughter, Alice, from birth. She said Alice took medicinal cannabis orally in liquid form every four hours and it was difficult to overstate the benefit her daughter received from the drug. ""Possibly the hardest thing in fighting for medical cannabis to be legalised is that I want to be able to tell people that this is a miracle. It's amazing,"" she said. ""But you can't use words like that when you're trying to put forward an argument for something that has real medical benefits because it sounds like you're selling snake oil, and that's not what we're doing. ""But for intents and purposes it really is a miracle, the difference in Alice's overall health and wellbeing."" Ms Cowles said she has been overwhelmed by the response since going public about using medical cannabis to treat her daughter.  She said she has been contacted by scores of people in chronic pain or watching terminally ill loved ones suffer since telling her family's story.   ""These are the real stories that come up over and over again,"" she said. ""So originally I spoke publicly because I thought it would help to protect Alice and I with what we were doing, but it's become bigger than that."" Ms Cowles also told the inquiry that Alice's respite carers were not able to administer the treatment because it was illegal. Dr Eric Ratcliff, from the Royal Australian & New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, told the inquiry a medicinal cannabis trial ""probably would be a good idea"" but it must be a proper scientific trial and not one based on ""a few stories that tug at the heartstrings"". He said he and his colleagues wanted to inject some caution into the hearing because they knew the dangers cannabis posed in terms of psychosis and schizophrenia.  ""There is a concern that your deliberations and the publicity surrounding them is assisting the idea that this is a safe, versatile drug without dangers and this is not the case,"" he said. He said over the past 40 years illegal cannabis had been cultivated to contain higher and higher concentrations of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and that lawful crops should be far less potent. ""It's been modified in a way that's negative. What we've go to do is redress that, go back to a product that is more balanced and less likely to cause the adverse effects that we've observed,"" he said. The inquiry also heard from the Huon Valley Council which looked favourably upon medicinal cannabis as a potential new industry for the region.  Given the Huon Valley's high rate of youth unemployment the council was keen to adopt a promising new industry, believing medicinal cannabis would help diversify the local economy and improve economic development. The Tasmanian Government had already made a written submission to the committee saying it would back clinical testing in the right circumstances. The New South Wales Government, meantime, was setting up a clinical trial of medical marijuana. On Wednesday Prime Minister Tony Abbott weighed into the debate saying he had no problem with the medical use of cannabis. The revelation was was picked up by the Opposition's Lara Giddings in State Parliament. ""I never thought I'd see the day where I absolutely agree with Tony Abbott and the comments he's made around medical cannabis,"" she said. Premier Will Hodgman wants to discuss consistency and security around medicinal cannabis at a federal level. The issue is expected to be on the agenda at next month's Council of Australian Government's (COAG) meeting in Canberra. The Upper House inquiry will hold more hearings on Friday and Monday.

Please try again later. This was published 2 years ago Australia's biggest medicinal cannabis extraction and contract manufacturing plant will be built at a secret location in Melbourne's south-east in a $50 million project aiming to help the local industry become more self-sufficient. The facility will be owned, funded and operated by The Valens Company, a Canadian medicinal cannabis business listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. However, an Australian distributor of medicinal cannabis, Cannvalate, is managing the project, hiring staff and fitting it out with the necessary equipment. Dr Sud Agarwal, chief executive of Cannvalate, says the new medicinal cannabis manufacturing plant will reduce Australia's reliance on imported products.Credit:Simon Schluter The 4500 square metre facility will process raw material and produce a range of finished medicines, including soft gel capsules, tablets and ointments. It will have double perimeter fences, 24 hour CCTV and a range of other security measures, including a vault where finished products will be stored. ""It will be very, very secure,"" said Cannvalate chief executive Sud Agarwal. Under licensing requirements, the plant's address cannot be disclosed but it will be in close proximity to cannabis cultivation sites. ""It's going to be the biggest manufacturing plant in Australia, probably by a factor of at least five times. So it's going to completely change the dynamic of cannabis extraction and cannabis manufacturing,"" Dr Agarwal said. New figures from Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration show that demand for medicinal cannabis prescriptions hit 3378 in April, which is more than triple the total in April last year of 1108. Dr Agarwal said Australia was the fourth largest medicinal cannabis market in the world behind the US, Canada and Germany. However, the vast majority of medicinal cannabis currently used in Australia is imported. ""Probably 95 per cent plus of all the stuff that's getting given to Australian patients, is imported from Canada or Europe,"" Mr Agarwal said. Construction on the facility is expected to start before September, with completion scheduled for the middle of 2021. Cannvalate, which has flagged plans to list on the ASX, has also signed a five-year distribution agreement with Valens. The Canadian company confirmed its plans to enter the local market this month, describing Australia as ""the second largest cannabis market outside of North America"". It’s going to completely change the dynamic of cannabis extraction and cannabis manufacturing. Peter Crock, chairman of the industry group Medicinal Cannabis Industry Australia and chief executive of the $150 million ASX-listed medicinal cannabis company Cann Group, said long term forecasts indicated Australia could eventually have 300,000 to 600,000 patients using medicinal cannabis. ""Accelerating access for patients is really what everyone's working towards and this is going to be a significant development in that, to have cost-effective medicines available for patients,"" he said. ""It will definitely be one of the purpose-built facilities of scale and so that is going to be important. It definitely has a role to play and that level of investment will be significant,"" he said. Joshua Fegan, CEO of the ASX-listed medicinal cannabis company Althea, said about 70 per cent of Althea's patients used medicinal cannabis for pain management, with the rest using it for conditions including PTSD, anxiety and insomnia.

98,Faster path to medicinal cannabis reopened as Government defeated in Senate,Tue 13 Jun 2017 at 6:46am," Faster path to medicinal cannabis reopened as Government defeated in Senate Medicinal cannabis produced overseas will be easier to access for terminally ill patients, after the Senate voted to remove tighter controls imposed by the Federal Government. The changes will restore 'fast-tracked' access to some unregistered medicinal cannabis medications produced overseas, but the move has been slammed by the Government as ""reckless"". While taking steps last year to make medicinal cannabis more accessible, the Government also put in place stricter regulations. While doctors previously only had to notify the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) of their intention to treat a terminally ill patient with the unregistered medication, the changes forced doctors to apply to the TGA for permission. The changes moved the medications from what is known as category A of the special access scheme to category B. Advocates for medicinal cannabis argued it slowed down access for terminally ill patients. The Federal Government has approved the sale of medicinal marijuana, but it still won't be easy for people to get a prescription. Under questioning in Senate estimates recently, TGA officials said category B applications were being decided on generally within 48 hours, and all had been approved. The Senate has now voted to reverse that change, despite the opposition of the Federal Government. Greens leader Richard di Natale moved the disallowance motion in the Senate, and said it reopened a pathway that should be available to the terminally ill. ""If you have a terminal illness, then you should be able to get access to treatment that is going to improve you quality of life,"" he said. The decision was supported by Labor, One Nation and other crossbenchers. Health Minister Greg Hunt said there was already a safe and legal way to access medicinal cannabis, and this decision simply removed safeguards. ""They have acted in defiance of the advice of the TGA, in defiance of the advice of the leading medical practitioners in the AMA and the College of GPs, even in defiance of the views of Palliative Care Australia,"" he said. He said it was a dangerous decision, and that he was seeking advice about the Government's options. ""The TGA could not be clearer, that it is a potential risk not just to health, but to lives,"" he said. ""It is unfortunately a reckless and irresponsible decision, I would call upon [those who voted for it] to reflect upon that. ""We cannot accept this, and I have asked the TGA for advice.""
