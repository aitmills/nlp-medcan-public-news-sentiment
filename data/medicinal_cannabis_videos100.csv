TRLbUVAfuaY,"Medicinal Cannabis in Australia Update, June 2022",2022-06-16T06:04:54Z,[Music] my name is robert stringer i'm a senior director of regulatory affairs at pharmalex my name's theresa nicoletti i'm a partner at mills oakley lawyers i'm the head of health and life sciences for the national practice i'm ian mcgregor i'm professor and academic director at the lambert initiative at the university of sydney brain and mind center ian touched on the attitudinal elements of the prescriber base there that not all prescribers in the in the gp land are convinced of the evidence and so it seems a bit more of a centralization of of prescribing that's probably also driven by clinics as well so because of the complexities associated with the sas program and supply a lot of clinics would be getting much more than their proportion of of representation within the gp area so i think that probably contributes to why the gps are a little significantly less involved than pharmacy yeah so some of the challenges there is that a lot of the work has been done uh focusing almost at um at the scientific level and the uh and the proof of concept level in the published work in these areas but it's not been thinking too hard historically on the regulatory space so how you actually build a regulator file what a regulatory quality study is required to to meet the regulator's requirements and so you have a disconnect between a lot of the publications and this and the evidence that's out there versus what would be required to have an approved product in australia or the us or europe it's interesting the the evidence gap that prescribing is galloping ahead for i think more than 130 indications that patients are currently being treated with medicinal cannabis products and we barely have adequate evidence for one condition if you hold it to modern pharma standards so that produces an interesting tension for prescribers who have great enthusiasm amongst patients for these products but their professional colleges might be much more skeptical and indeed even advise them not to prescribe unless it's part of a clinical trial in terms of conditions chronic pain is the is the big one more than 60 of current prescriptions are for chronic pain and we have the faculty of pain meds and telling their members not to prescribe municipal cannabis unless part of a clinical trial pain is complicated because there's so many different types of pain and then you've got more than 240 medicinal cannabis products currently available you've maybe got 100 different pain conditions how do you patch that all together i mean it's uh it's it's really quite bamboozling and difficult for people that are running clinical trials to know where to focus their efforts with so many products but there are some interesting ones going on there's a lot of observational data that's been gathered we're targeting particular types of pain spinal cord injury neuropathic pain is one large trial we're running at the moment we're also interested in epidermolysis bullosa which is a horribly debilitating skin condition that we're working on and also osteoarthritis which is incredibly common millions of sufferers worldwide and we're working on a cbd topical that we think is going to be highly effective for that in 2016 when uh the the narcotic drag drugs act was first changed to legalize cultivation production and manufacture of medicinal cannabis carried with it a very restrictive scheme where there was an overlay of federal and and state regulation for medicinal cannabis products and the reason for that is that there wasn't a lot of knowledge about the quality and safety of medicinal cannabis products in particular so regulators were reluctant to introduce a facilitative scheme for that reason but as we've gained more and more experience around it and and as we've become more comfortable with the types of products that are being supplied to the market um the scheme has relaxed to some extent so there's now only a federal layer of regulation for access and we've seen the numbers of prescriptions rise quite significantly since that happened from the point of view of how we regulate medicinal cannabis products there are only two products that are currently registered in the artg epidialex and satellites and both of those drugs are for quite restricted indications when we've got as ian said more than 130 different age indications that cannabis can be used for and so in the main the products are all unapproved therapeutic goods that are used for indications that are not on the register and they're being supplied under the unapproved access schemes which are the special access scheme and authorized prescriber scheme the cost of those products is high because they can't be subsidized and that's because the only products that are eligible for subsidy are those that are registered in the australian register of therapeutic goods and so it's a bit of a double-edged sword we want access to the products and we want it quickly and so we've introduced these unapproved access schemes but that means that they can't get subsidisation because they're not on the register so the only way we can address affordability at the moment is either to get those products registered in the aitg or otherwise have more competition in the market which allows supply and demand to equilibrate and prices to start to come down there's some trends for example in chronic pain it seems to be starting to stabilize a little bit whereas with mental health conditions particularly things like adhd ptsd and depression we're seeing exponential growth at the moment part of that might be a little bit more of a relaxed attitude amongst prescribers and so chronic pain we don't have much of an argument if you've got severe chronic pain that a trial of medicinal cannabis is not necessarily a bad thing but particularly when you look at the alternatives like opioids and gabapentinoids and the substantial liabilities that these existing prescription medications have so chronic pain was there from the ground floor if you like in terms of prescribing it was always the number one indication i don't think the market's saturated but i think if you're a patient that wants to travel medicinal cannabis it's fairly straightforward to organize that there's a lot more retina reticence amongst prescribers for prescribing for things like depression they've all been told at medical school that cannabis is anathema when it comes to mental health you know the cannabis causes schizophrenia and so on as prescribers learn the difference between thc and cbd and become aware of cbd's potential and mental health conditions i think we'll see a lot more prescribing that's perhaps part of the reason that we're seeing this exponential growth for mental health conditions although having said that a lot of the products being prescribed do contain thc but the gps generally have a view of medicinal cannabis they think it's relatively safe and certainly our recent survey shows that they consider medicinal cannabis to be much safer than things like opioids benzodiazepines antidepressants and antipsychotics interesting in the early days of medicinal cannabis availability it was nearly all oils and the trend we've seen particularly over the last year has been a large increase in the prescribing of flower products where they now represent about 40 percent of all prescriptions and there might be a couple of reasons for that one is that you get a much more rapid effect with with flower so that might be if you have chronic pain if you vaporize medicinal cannabis flower then you might get a very quick alleviation of that pain whereas it could take an hour or two hours for an oil to have an effect the bioavailability is much slower and we're hearing of people with anxiety who are vaporizing cbd flower to get an instantaneous relief of panic and situational anxiety so that's a reason but another thing that may well be happening is this um gravitation from the green market you know traditional illicit users of cannabis who overwhelmingly use flour into the prescribed market and they don't want to change their use of flour to oil because they've always used flour for self-medication with cannabis they just want a prescription product rather than an illicit product so that might be another driver i think when you look at medicinal cannabis there's a belief structure associated with it for one of a better word so there's there is scientific evidence and there is um there's medical evidence that has efficacy in various areas but i think patients have a belief that it will work as well that's that's my personal experience and so they approach it with a positive mindset and if you've had particularly in areas like treatment resistant conditions you're looking for something that that's new and it's it it seems to be coming from a different direction and to me i think patients find that attractive and i included in the slides of the comment that um natural equals good and i don't think it goes quite as far as that but but there is a belief that there is some some level there that they will get some benefit from that and and that drives a patient acceptance there and i think from the regulatory sense that that is building on that and these these changes that seem small to start with in the legislative area opened the doors to a whole new industry that didn't exist um by 2015 and so you can see that without having those changes you'll always have a roadblock in how the patients can can actually receive the product so that's would be comments i'd put for that for me the start of my journey was personal my i watched my father die in quite excruciating pain from metastatic cancer and this was prior to legalization so i i started to see the therapeutic potential of medicinal cannabis in a number of pro bono cases that i dealt with of patients who couldn't get access and were being treated with polypharmacy and not getting the outcomes that that they needed to have any quality of life and through through legal representation we managed to get those patients access and the transformation in their quality of life and their ability to manage not just the symptoms of their disease but in some cases to reduce the size of tumors and overall therapeutic benefit was quite obvious and that really cemented my willingness to get involved in this industry and to really drive regulatory reform to ensure we had as accessible a scheme as possible and we talked about clinical evidence getting robust clinical evidence but i don't think we should discount these individual cases we always talk about these cases as anecdotal evidence evidence but these are real examples of patients that have been treated with many other drugs beforehand and have been able to dispense with most of those drugs by taking medicinal cannabis and you can treat that like an n of one clinical study and harness that sort of information and so i'm convinced that there is therapeutic value we just have to work out which products um are the most suitable for particular indication and there's a lot of work still to be done but i in it for the long haul i think it will become a very entrenched medicine more and more in years to come yeah so at the beginning of the lambert initiative we were dealing with a family who had a a young child with a severe pediatric epilepsy that and they were treating her condition by illegally sourcing a product containing cbd and indeed the the the father of caitlin lambert michael lambert ended up in court on charges for possession and supply of of cannabis and we helped defend him and i've done like teresa i've done a number of pro bono cases as well defending people who are doing what any parent would do or any family member would do for a loved one in need and it just seemed really bizarre that the state and the country would prosecute people for doing what anyone would do if they if they were saved and had compassion and so thankfully we've moved on from that situation the very product that you know michael lambert was in court for is now available on the pbs in australia for that same condition that caleb lambert has so what a long way we've come in terms of supply the remaining i mean the big problem at the moment i think for patients there's two there's driving and there's cost so if you're on thc product there's no exemption for roadside drug testing and conviction for driving with thc and we're using our signs to show that it's perfectly rational to allow patients to drive on thc products so long as they don't feel impaired and that would just bring medicinal cannabis in line with opioids and benzodiazepines and other prescription medicines that have the capacity to to impair driving so we need that urgent change for for our patients the cost one a lot of people who are wanting to access medicinal cannabis have chronic illnesses and disabilities and there are people that often are finding it hard to make ends meet so we do need to get other medications that are more widely used for conditions mental health conditions and chronic pain onto the pbs that that's the big frontier at the moment in terms of improving accessibility and making sure that cannabis-based medicines can be distributed to those that need them and please thank the presenters again [Music] you
hs2cc_UZww4,Australian medicinal cannabis industry on cusp of major expansion | ABC News,2021-12-19T06:35:33Z,this is what legal cannabis looks like on an industrial scale with 40 staff and plans to hire 60 more this is big business this is a cannabis plant and it's one of 3 000 in this greenhouse overall we have another 10 000 plants growing outdoors as well so 13 000 at the moment today is harvest day in a greenhouse designed to grow the best cannabis flowers possible so every one of these plants is a clone and that is how we're controlling the consistency of the output for ceo dan howard the pungent smell and the sight of so much cannabis is normal has recently moved from canada where cannabis is legal so from the medical market evolved the adult use market and that has now proliferated across the country with thousands and thousands of stores and hundreds of producers producing government controlled taxed and high-quality cannabis across the country do you see what happened in canada also occurring here in australia i believe australia's on a similar path confidence in the future of the market has companies spending big millions of dollars in development means this company is about to upgrade from this greenhouse to this one to date most medicinal cannabis consumed in australia has been imported from overseas but industry says this is changing as patient access to product is streamlined and new regulation levels the playing field for domestic producers josie hamlet who manages compliance says these changes are a good start but the rules are complex and inconsistent there's been a lot of permit and license reforms which has definitely made our life easier here instead of having like three licenses and six permits with the they've all been rolled into one ultimately this complexity impacts people like peter fielding who was diagnosed with esophagus cancer two years ago he's been using medicinal cannabis and says the drug works wonders it doesn't save your life but it certainly helps to extend it i was given four months i'm now up to 23 months and about five days not that i'm counting mr fielding says getting it remains difficult and expensive even though it's legal now try finding somebody who can prescribe it legally try finding one it's still a problem a growing industry for a growing need david barnett clement abc news you
wK1L4ESJeIM,Medicinal cannabis access for consumers,2020-09-25T01:26:19Z,"So you’ve heard about medicinal cannabis. Maybe you’re wondering if it's right for your condition. Speak to your doctor about your health concerns. Your doctor will consider treatment options… and they may decide that a medicinal cannabis product is suitable for your needs. Most medicinal cannabis products are not approved medicines in Australia. This means the Therapeutic Goods Administration (or TGA) has not assessed them for safety, quality or effectiveness. But sometimes there are no approved medicines that meet a patient’s needs. That’s why any doctor can apply to the TGA for special access to unapproved medicines such as medicinal cannabis. They’ll hear back within two business days. Some doctors have applied to become Authorised Prescribers, which means they don’t need approval from the TGA for each individual patient. If your doctor gives you a prescription for a medicinal cannabis product, you will need to take it to a pharmacy. Medicinal cannabis products aren’t stocked in most pharmacies, so your pharmacist may need to order it in. You should also know that medicinal cannabis products are not subsidised through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; the supplier sets the cost. Beware of buying online. You could break the law and get an unsafe product. Legal access to medicinal cannabis means getting a prescription from your doctor and filling the prescription at your pharmacy. If you have any questions, speak with your doctor. You can also find out more on the TGA website."
TLLyfNnCQ7s,"Medicinal cannabis use rises with 260,000 prescriptions filled in six years | Today Show Australia",2022-07-19T03:27:42Z,welcome back well the use of medicinal cannabis has skyrocketed across the country with more and more aussies being prescribed the drug the latest figures from the tga show over 260 000 prescriptions have been issued for the drug in the past six years it's interesting isn't it for more we're joined by dr brad mckay in studio dr brad good morning to you what is behind this spike in prescriptions it was not really a spike what we're seeing is just an exponential rise in the the number of prescriptions so half of that 260 000 prescriptions have happened the last 12 months so we're we're not seeing any sign of it slowing down and they've just been increasing exponential interest in medicinal cannabis so what is it helping to treat why is it so effective yeah so we we know that there's evidence there's good evidence for it i'm treating some children with epilepsy so i'm treatment resistant epilepsy we know there's evidence for multiple sclerosis with spasticity and then there's growing evidence when it comes to like pain relief um so chronic pain is probably the majority of the prescriptions being being used um and also um chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting so people having cancer and yeah like all and then there's yeah hundreds of different conditions that it is being prescribed for over over time wow and is it still quite difficult to access what what are the protocols or procedures yeah so there's very few doctors um that are prescribing it still it is growing and then why do why is there only a small number of doctors who will prescribe it um so a number of reasons one is that we really haven't had much education about it so there was nothing on it when i was going through medical school so we're only starting to get some of that information into students these days but also like it's really difficult uh to navigate the system so there's all sorts of protocols and hurdles and lots and lots of paperwork to get through to actually prescribe cannabis products for patients what about legalizing it i mean i just you know more and more countries are doing it now shouldn't that happen here and are you a writer on the whole marijuana do you think that would have a bad effect for the medicinal cannabis people out there i think we've sort of been driven into this fear and stigma about cannabis and as different companies are opening it up we're seeing that the sky isn't falling in um that uh yeah we're not not seeing major sort of addiction problems overseas um and yeah like allowing people to have more access to it um hasn't been seen to be a major problem in other countries is there a side effect though if you are taking medicinal cannabis and you're worried about it for whatever reason you're taking it for whether it's pain or whatever that there might be side effects uh like there can be some side effects but what what we sort of find with patients is that they've often come to the end of the road so they've tried all sorts of different products so say you've got chronic pain this is one of the next things that we can use for patients if it works for them they it can be life-changing and it can like get them back to work it can have major ramifications and if it doesn't work then they just stop it and they look at something else that they could use so it's a little little impact so what would be your advice to someone who thinks that medicinal cannabis may be able to help their ailment yeah so um certainly uh we would normally say to speak to your gp is a bit hesitant well and this is the problem so there are many gps who just don't want a bar of it um it's sort of like a don't ask hotel situation there's still a stigma in the medical profession there are some online clinics as well that you can go online and have a chat with somebody even from a phone call or a video call but yeah also finding a gp in your area who does prescribe medicinal cannabis is a good option as well and have those sort of like frank one-to-one discussions about it all right dr brad great to have you inside thanks mate thank you dr brad you
pBBECjNuRw0,Medical cannabis set to become financially accessible  | 7NEWS,2021-11-27T09:02:29Z,
d9v8dkkCJVQ,My experience accessing medical cannabis in Australia,2022-06-06T06:23:54Z,so i recently decided to access medical cannabis products through the legal medical pathway and i just wanted to share a little bit more about my journey and how it's been so i had my first appointment with the doctor and i just thought i'd go through what it was like what happened and what products i got prescribed so it was a telehealth appointment and it went for about 15 minutes all up i think it was scheduled to go for about 30 minutes but it didn't end up taking that full amount of time to go through everything with the doctor so he started the appointment by asking what symptoms i was hoping to treat with cannabis and he just wanted a background on the issues i'd been experiencing and just how they were impacting me day to day so i did explain to the doctor i was there mostly for pain issues some related to a long-term lower back injury but also some new symptoms i was experiencing in my upper back as well in addition to that my sleep had been really interrupted and disturbed and i was noticing that it was having a really big impact on my overall my mood energy my motivation and just my ability to deal with day-to-day tasks effectively so the doctor also wanted to know about what other treatments i'd tried in the past to manage these symptoms and he also wanted to know about the medications i'd tried as well and obviously he wanted to know about any current medications i was taking just to assess for potential drug interactions between medical cannabis and pharmaceuticals which is obviously super important he also wanted to know if i had tried cannabis or cbd before and i decided honesty was the best policy in this instance and i did tell him that i had tried a full spectrum cbd oil in the usa and that i really had amazing results from this product um so he was super supportive of this actually and he said it's great that i've tried some black market products because now he has that baseline knowledge that previously cannabis has had a positive effect on me um he just he went on to explain that the benefit of seeing a doctor is that they can essentially tailor products to try and achieve a better outcome probably better than what i could get by myself going through the green or the black market so the other benefit is that they can monitor your progress and results and they can change products if they need to so he did go on to explain that there are a lot of different medical cannabis products available in australia at the moment some are australian and some are also from overseas manufacturers he made a few recommendations on products he would prescribe for my specific conditions and i ended up getting a full spectrum cbd oil for the daytime and a thc and cbd blend for the night time so i was quite specific with the doctor that i wanted a high quality organically grown product from australia he wasn't able to tell me whether the products were organically grown just that they were manufactured in accordance with the good manufacturing practices um overall the appointment was a positive experience the doctor was super supportive of my journey with cannabis but i did find there was overall a lack of knowledge sharing between doctor and patient i think if i was a complete newbie to cannabis i would have been a bit confused after the consult particularly in terms of how the products might make me feel and this is specific to thc uh because it does have the potential to make me feel high or impair me so i think there is a little bit of a gap in terms of the knowledge that patients are leaving appointments with um he also wasn't to give me wasn't able to give me a huge amount of information about the products either and i did end up calling the manufacturer to try and get answers to my questions so the appointment did wrap up pretty quickly um as i mentioned it went for about 15 minutes the doctor then emailed through the e-scripts so i could have them filled in that email he also included a titration dosage guide to follow so that made it really easy for me to understand how much of the both products i should start out with and how much to increase by at what time intervals the doctor also made some recommendations for pharmacies as well um i did end up going to my local pharmacy and they did quote me 30 less than the other recommended pharmacies so it can actually be worthwhile shopping around for quotes when it comes to filling medical cannabis scripts there is potential to save a few dollars by doing that so in the next video i'm going to talk more about the products that i received what i think of them and how they're working for me so i'm just going to talk a little bit about the products i got prescribed and how they're affecting me the benefits i'm getting from them if they're working for me and just talk a little bit more about each product in detail okay so these are the three products that i have been prescribed by the doctor so i have two oil products and i also have a cbd flower product so the first one is the little green pharma cbd50 so this is a 50 milligram per mil full spectrum cbd oil and it does contain up to .2 milligrams of thc per mil as well the next product is the lgp classic 20 to 5. so the the 20 to 5 actually refers to the ratio of thc to cbd and because this is a thc dominant product it has 20 milligrams of thc per ml and 5 milligrams of cbd per ml and the third product is actually a cbd dried flower from antg so i'll just talk about each of these products in depth a little bit more now so the first product i'm going to talk about is the little green pharma full spectrum cbd oil that i was prescribed so it is the cbd 50 so it contains 50 milligrams of cbd per ml and it contains up to 0.2 milligrams of thc per ml so i have titrated my dosage from a starting point of 0.25 mils all the way up to one mil and i've found that has been the most beneficial dosage for me personally i have experimented and gone up to 1.5 into two mils and while i haven't felt impaired from the thc it definitely had more of a sedative effect the higher the dosage i had so with this particular product it was prescribed as a daytime product basically because it wasn't meant to have any impairment or sedate me in fact the doctor said potentially it could even have the opposite effect to that so it could be energizing for the daytime while also simultaneously helping control pain symptoms so just a little bit about how this smells and tastes i will show you every time you get a medical cannabis product prescribed you get a little syringe and it has very small dosages starting at point one mil all the way up to one mil so you can be really precise uh when you're titrating your dosages up or down so as you can see this oil is very very clear it um has very little flavor or smell to be honest it's um in terms of the terpenes it's super mild it actually has quite a creamy nutty flavor um because of that it is an easy oil to take there's no overwhelming flavor to it or scent it's very smooth i guess is a good word to describe taking it in terms of the effects i haven't noticed a massive impact on my pain levels but we do know that some people need more thc in order to bring down the inflammation and the pain more effectively so it also hasn't helped me with sleep but it was prescribed as a daytime product as well the thing that it has helped me the most with is bringing down stress levels and managing okay so the next product i'm going to talk about is the little green pharma lgb classic 20 to 5 so as i mentioned 20 to 5 refers to the ratio of thc to cbd this is a high thc product and was prescribed as a nighttime product because it obviously has the ability to impair me and also sedate me and it was prescribed to help manage my sleep issues and also just to help with those chronic pain symptoms that i have been experiencing so in terms of this oil it is um quite a bit darker than the full spectrum cbd oil and to me it has more of a piney minty kind of smell to it and also flavor as well it actually smells really beautiful the terpenes in it are really nice and the flavor is really nice as well so for me this particular oil was very strong i obviously have a very low tolerance to thc so i started with an initial dosage of 0.25 mils which i took just before bed this seemed to be okay in terms of impairment but as i titrated up to about half a mil which is 10 milligrams of thc i definitely struggled a bit i um i was i felt too impaired to actually go to sleep um and it wasn't a nice feeling for me and what i have noticed with this product as well is that the following days after taking it i have had a bit of a headache and with the higher dosages that headache was worse and i've just felt quite groggy afterwards as well now if i compared this to a green market thc oil that a friend gave me i take two drops of that and i wake up actually feeling quite amazing the following day so i'll feel super energized really positive and my pain levels have gone way down obviously the problem is i don't know the strength of that oil so it is difficult to try and ascertain as to how much you're taking and whether you should keep increasing and also obviously how it's made as well um comes into question so unfortunately that particular um 20-5 product did not work for me personally but we do know that cannabis strains affect every single person differently so what works for me might not work for you and vice versa and i have read quite a few reviews on this particular product as well and there was one person who mentioned that they had similar symptoms to me where they had a bit of a headache the next day and just felt a bit hungover or groggy the following day however there are also a lot of really positive reviews for people who have been using it for pain symptoms and anxiety as well and have had really good results so the final product that i'm going to talk about is the antg cbd flower so this is obviously quite a different product to the previous oils that i've spoken about this is a cbd bud high cbd bud it does contain um thc still but the benefit of this is there's such a high dosage of cbd that it does counteract the effects that thc can have so this is one of the buds uh that came in with this product it is uh it contains 10 grams of dried flour so when i first got this i was really amazed by the scent of this it actually reminds me a lot of lemon sherbet it's got a very strong lemonade terpene smell to it and that definitely follows through when you vape it in a dry herb vape as well so for me this product has been really great for um going to sleep at night time and reducing pain so it contains um 140 milligrams of cbd per gram of flour and 10 milligrams of thc per gram of flour so the doctor did advise me to start by vaping 0.25 grams of dried flour and then titrate up from there so the doctor also advised to avoid smoking this and to use a dry herb vape for health reasons it's much safer in terms of having vapor instead of the combustion that occurs when you smoke so this product has been really beneficial for me um i do take it overnight time because it does well it doesn't make me feel super groggy or like i just can't keep my eyes open it does definitely help with relaxation before bed and i have noticed that my sleep has been really solid if i had this just before bed as well so i am finding these two products this for day and this for night to be really beneficial overall for relaxation reducing pain and for sleep which is the main things that i wanted to treat with medical cannabis
i5vS30AFLE4,Inside the burgeoning black market for medicinal marijuana | 7.30,2020-02-19T00:30:03Z,after I graduated high school obviously with my condition I wasn't sure whether I was ever going to be able to work kind of a standard normal jobs for much of his life Brent our Curie has relied on medication to manage his painful bowel condition called Crohn's disease it affects the lower half of my small intestine and what it does is it causes a lot of information and causes it to deteriorate over time every day I wake up I have some sort of pain purely due from eating food it can cause me to be very fatigued but nothing seemed to give the twenty-year-old from the Gold Coast the relief he needed until he tried cannabis oil all it is is just you put two jobs underneath your tongue and you let it sit there for about ten to fifteen seconds and then you usually just once to twice a day depending on how I'm going yeah and there's no psychoactive effects the way I can feel the effects is when I feel like medicinal cannabis was first legalized across the country in 2016 with the approval of the Therapeutic Goods Administration GPS can prescribe cannabis oil to their patients but even though brent has been through that process he simply can't afford to fill the prescription I was very lucky I have a specialist he wrote in a really good letter of recommendation and I was able to get accepted for this medicine but it's only after you get accepted they tell you all the associated costs Brent was paying about $600 a month for cannabis oil prescribed by his GP a cost he says was beyond his means instead he's turned to a surging online black-market for the medicine where he's now paying a quarter of that price it does cause me a lot of anxiety honestly it does because I do think there is still a large stigma based around it at this point and it does make me fear a bit because I could get pulled over at any time and drug tested so that fear is always in the back of my head when I'm driving around yes [Music] but the licensed cannabis industry warns there's no guarantee of purity or safety with black-market products in comparison to growing in a backyard we have complete control over the environment we test every part of the way to make sure there's no contaminants bacteria or mold that's building up in the plant at a secret facility south of Perth a pharmaceutical company farms cannabis to make legal medicinal oil it's one of the first of its kind in Australia after being granted a licence by the federal Health Department we're currently expanding our facility so we'll be able to produce 10 times more bottles than what we're producing now to be able to look after not only the Australian mark demand but also the international markets fleeter solomon acknowledges her company's product is more expensive during part to higher production costs to meet strict regulations we know what price we give to the wholesaler but we don't have any say over what the retailers put so we don't know exactly what the patients are playing at the end but in law here in Australia if I said well let's let's treated as a medical product cuz then it can be made to high quality so yes it adds some cost but it also means that it's quality product given under medical supervision there is currently no subsidy for cannabis products under the pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme the TGA expects this may change but not for some time the situation that we're working towards is for the clinical trial to be done and for companies to put submissions to us but those trials take a couple of years and then they have to get the results and then submit them as they do for any other medicine meanwhile a Senate inquiry is now looking into problems with access and regulation of the industry as a whole I think there's a lot of ways the system could be improved for a lot of Australians it is just simply unaffordable to have costs like that associated with medicine excited for tomorrow yeah in the Melbourne suburb of croy day Emma brown lives with chronic pain after a car accident in 2015 three days later I woke up in hospital and I had a brace on and couldn't move and it's really bad and I just wanted to see my kids in accident the accident left the 35 year old with permanent damage to her spine and unable to work I changed my life in so many different ways and not just the physical obviously it hurts it hurts a lot every day I was less sociable I just sort of found myself not wanting to go in through things because it hurt to do it like Brent our Curie emma was prescribed other pain medications but nothing worked until she tried cannabis she was granted legal access to cannabis oil by a doctor but was simply unable to afford the prescription to look at the price of being on the cannabis oil with your prescription it was approximately five hundred and twenty dollars a month that we have cost me for the product would've ended up costing me over a third of my income approximately my pension to go on this dedication and then black market you're looking at approximately $120 for a 30ml bottle over thousand milligrams or so I yeah to me it's a no-brainer right now I'm not on I currently smoke of an evening just to sort of band-aid the detention in my back I'm not you know I'm not advocating everyone getting stoned being left with no other option but to go black market it does make me feel bad I definitely feel judged both Mr Brown and Brent are Kure hope the Senate inquiry will prompt desperately needed change it's set up so we fail like here it is but you can omit there is no way I can afford that product so where am I left in pain I just don't understand what I would hope is is that it shifts a bit more of the conversation around to this time issue because there's an issue that affects a lot of Australians and it is something that could potentially help millions of more Australians they're just not even aware of it at this point hi I'm Leigh sales thanks for watching this story if you'd like to watch more of 730 stories they are on the left of your screen and tap on the button below to subscribe and

Neu2DxPL7Ec,How to get your medical marijuana card in Australia - #36,2022-11-21T13:00:07Z,hello and welcome to the binge vinca my name is Jamil Raymond it's an absolute pleasure to have you here as always uh today's episode starts with a bit of a revelation uh I have recently acquired my medical marijuana card can you tell [Laughter] um that's more for the the YouTube peeps I have decked out uh a new uh studio for the binge finger in a corner of my lounge room it is looking fantastic guys if you're listening to this podcast and not getting a video do yourself a [ __ ] favor and get onto YouTube also subscribe while you're there and have a look at what I've put together aesthetically it's you got it'll change the way that you receive this podcast from now on that's what I genuinely believe um so I'm very excited to keep evolving this and getting this more aligned with who I am and it's a lot of fun um it's hard to believe I did this with a [ __ ] injured um and injured bicep tendon in the last week but let me tell you so like the new layout for the binge thinker it basically just came out of again pure synchronicity I believe I was about to upgrade the the look of the studio a little bit because I want to put these books somewhere um and I was like all right I'll go get another shitty Kmart shelf that's what's been propping up the rest of my shelves at the moment um around the house for all the podcasts and gear that I carry around I've got so much storage like two days after I think about that I'm walking down my street here in footscray and 120 meters from my house a chiropractor is giving away old office furniture and if you look to the left here or you're my right they had three of these storage cubes these big-ass storage cubes just ready to [ __ ] give away they literally said free to take on Facebook and I jumped and I was like holy [ __ ] I can't believe it that's perfect for what I did in the studio so I [ __ ] ran in there and I was like I actually once I grabbed I grabbed one I'll be real I grabbed one and tried to hoist myself 120 meters the big four panel one over here the other two um pieces have two drawers in them so you can't quite hoist them but now yeah I'm like hey I'll shotgun these three do you ever try by any chance I'm in the sling I'm trying to get some brownie points here so they can help me out maybe all I need is the trolley really um I got the rest of it myself because it's like it's like that Echo it's like Hollow plywood it's not like it's hard or anything like that it's literally like maybe 10 kilos to pick up that thing maybe less it's not that heavy at all so I'm like I could hoist it but if you had Wheels this would be much better and lo and behold uh the guy had um the guy that was moving all the [ __ ] out had the trolley for me so I [ __ ] wheeled them back to my place I'm just like [ __ ] great all I was trying to do I swear to God was go get a croissant I'm just going to get croissant get a nice something for breakfast I've been chilling out lately on my macros um because of recovering from the bicep tendon stuff and then yeah minding my own business enjoying life Bang these three shelves storage cubes I guess you would call them that have radically transformed the way that my house looks and how I store things in the house and then has been the Catalyst for this full transformation of my space um to create a permanent aesthetic studio for the binge thinker and other visual projects from now on because I've got a few in the works I'm not going to lie so guys what I was really excited to talk to you about was the acquisition of my medical marijuana card now this is something I've been thinking about for quite some time um given that you guys would know on the Pod that I'm a you know regular but very light smoker of marijuana and I am very poet um it has given me a lot of value in my life as far as a healing tool when using the right circumstances absolutely I have definitely abused it but with you know as far as abuses go and the toxicity of it like compared to other drugs um yeah it's [ __ ] not that big a deal but I guess what I'm sort of wrestling with is the shame around my marijuana consumption because I did have a lot of it because it was considered illegal um just where I was until now and then also my parents come from conservative backgrounds so knowing that consumption of marijuana they would not be happy with and that's I sort of kept that you know aside from them for quite some time I've never really addressed it with them as an adult but you know in stepping forth in you know trying to honor my authenticity about talking about my own mental health and being open about it and the benefits of what I've done marijuana is certainly there it has certainly improved my life for the better um as a huge net positive by allowing me to get me out of myself and out of my anxiety it's an anti-anxiety medication for me um it's also an antidepressant relaxant it gets me out of my monkey mind my highly anxious mind and allows me to feel into my body a bit more as you can tell by this again absolute [ __ ] Kaleidoscope of any outfit that I put together foreign so there are a lot of positives that has brought into my life I'm grateful to have it as a medicine in my life and to treat it as such but I'll be honest I didn't think of it like that for quite some time um you know it was a getaway and I knew it was a getaway but so is any other sort of drug that is consumed um for the purposes of null and pain it's a Panadol you know and that's just the legal version beer alcohol is illegal alcohol is legal sorry and a beer after work that's what it is for me is socially acceptable so the Paradigm is shifted a significant amount for me and with that you know I'm stepping into this for a bit of fun but there is certainly a fair bit of Shame that's been wrapped around which I'm trying to punch through in doing this and again I just want to be really open and honest about it because yeah this is also a factor of re-parenting around my parents expectations of me which has been very heavy since I've carried a lot of Shame around my parents expectations of me but they no I'm trying to say is like I live a [ __ ] great life and this is only one small element of a very Broad very positive very healthy lifestyle that I've got so and I need to create the space for it to be respected and to be able to talk openly about it despite whatever their religion tells them or their upbringing tells them about drugs or just marijuana other drugs I couldn't give a [ __ ] it's about marijuana in particular it's a plant it's natural I'm not saying it's the answer to everything at all I am a responsible advocate for its use or an advocate for the responsible use 100 percent so it's like all right I gotta leave them I gotta live in my belief system in public you know so that's what I'm doing here that's why I've talked to you about this uh on today's app and I'll address it with you know the corporation or my parents in due course don't snitch if this is my family let me deal with that situation will you so how I got into it was that you know what I was thinking I was running out of good weed dealers in this town place has gone drier Melbourne's falling apart ladies and gentlemen when it comes to good quality gunge but um so I was like okay it's medical how far how much effort is there is in there to get into the system like what's it about as I thought it was only for cancer patients and you know the usual stuff like glaucoma and stuff like that a friend a friend referred me onto it because we got um you know we just got into drug talk as you do from time to time in life and they let me know that yeah you can basically get access to marijuana for medically for anything not anything but a lot more than you think is a better way to put that and I was like oh okay well I've got you know I've had um you know anxiety I've had depression in the past um I've taken antidepressants like is that is that enough to say that's a chronic disease I can try and then um the guy's like yeah it should be um you know go through this process as a website so it's a website for yeah these doctors that specialize and that have the approval to provide um a TGA what's it called yeah a TGA permit for medical marijuana which is actually recognized all over the country so basically what I did was the process is that it was a web form the web form just asked me about my history about my medical history anything that was chronic um you know about my history about physical mental health what is this chronic condition that is trying to treat so one of the um key components of eligibility for medical marijuana is that you cannot it's [ __ ] says 420 on my [ __ ] stove right now give me one sec are you [ __ ] kidding me bro that's sick God bless the [ __ ] Spirits man for that sort of [ __ ] really to put a 420 in my periphery it's not even 420 it's 8 o'clock on a Sunday night when I'm doing this and because I didn't [ __ ] fix my um oven uh after I've had multiple power outages here because they're doing Network upgrades bang 420 on the 420 Falcon topic the spirit I dress like this for a [ __ ] reason guys I dress like this for a [ __ ] reason God is good so where the [ __ ] was I [Laughter] um oh the process so the process was did the web form I have had anxiety I've had depression um I had I was clinically depressed 18 years old that's the start of this transformation do you know the story I was on antidepressants from like 17 18ish did not like them ssris they dulled me so they you know they took away a bit of Joy but it took away a lot of the sadness too right but I definitely felt this null Purgatory was on ssris which is a feeling I don't really want to enjoy again or feel again and only consciously recently have understood how anxious I am as an individual and where I feel it in my body um which makes perfect sense as to why marijuana is good for me because I have a hyperactive mind mind I'm not quite ADHD but I'm close and I'm definitely High Strung internally so yeah it's been a great medicine to provide anti-anxiety for me so let's so I say that to them I go hey this is what I've got I've got the scripts if you need them web form submitted history done a few days later it's a Telehealth appointment this doctor is based in Sydney now this doctor very nice guy do an appointment on a Sunday morning 8 30 the Sunday morning this guy loves life he loves his job because he's [ __ ] letting you know that you can smoke weed on a Sunday morning what a life good on you brother I'm going to protect your name but what a life you live yeah I do the I do the call within minutes I get the approval it's not even it's just like a check box it's not even a it's not a serious questioning or anything like that he's like yep I've seen enough evidence happy to recommend you for medical marijuana give you approval whatever the I don't even know how to say it properly still um you know this is very very kind you know he said something about like you know you should have your choice in how you treat your mental health you know you best and he's [ __ ] right you know what I mean he's absolutely right but because it's again the shame aspect and so much shame put around marijuana this is a negative drug that um yeah just impacts your perception of it and how you consume it but now I'm trying to push away from that as I've said many times you can tell it's a repetitive Loop in my head you can tell I'm pushing an edge here but hey welcome to be part of it so um so for the I get the approval ask about what's next the next stages are um uh they make a recommendation for my prescription I asked the question if I can get sativas as the weed strain because I know that they're creative and uplifting and this Frame that I like and he's like yep that's fine you can absolutely recommend that I was like [ __ ] sweet this is so Good by the way I'm ecstatic that this is happening by the way I can't believe this is happening and I'll explain you just get you'll understand they're like okay here's your script so I am now scripted 20 grams of medical grade bud 60 mils of psychoactive THC pure THC and 30 ml of pure CBD and I have multiple repeats of that um and yeah I feel like I've unlocked an unlimited weed cheat code I swear to God and I don't know if this is bad because I want to put out on a [ __ ] podcast that I'm like showing this off and maybe it is maybe I'll cut this part out but it's like [ __ ] what a bounty that has happened in my life because I just now it's just like for me again someone has wrestled with this for so long it's now legal like it's just like yeah boom like here's a clear passageway to consume it and I'm like whoa it's such a big I'm like the elephant that's caged you know he's got the chain around his foot and they just break the chain off on this big elephant I'm still smoking it it's just this weird ability to be free to smoke it and not feel constrained by it that's the big deal very interesting so they give me the weeds so yeah so I get the weeds amazing I am ecstatic uh it gets dispensed from a they have their suggested dispensaries I'm not going to argue obviously they might take a clip or something from the back end who gives a [ __ ] let them enjoy it yep so I order it remote uh I get the approval on the Sunday I'll order it like Monday Tuesday night get it by the Friday and it's like Christmas I'll be real it's like [ __ ] Christmas it's greener than Christmas that's for sure um I look at the dosage and it's very liberal it's anywhere from 0.01 of a gram to one gram on the flower as required like they're telling me it's medically okay to smoke up to a gram of weed per day that's crazy like I know people that do that but that's definitely not me I smoke like a thumbnail's worth almost daily but that's how little I consume it's like having half a shot honestly and like I've got all these scripts to I don't even know what the expiry is on these repeats so it's like how much are they expecting me to smoke in some ways very weird very weird but I'm you know I'm a responsible uh smoker so for me I never drive on it um because if I you know I get caught with you know and lose my license so much of my life is ruined so I'm responsible with it I never smoke I never and drive I've never intoxicated when I drive um uh yeah and I do not believe that people should be driving intoxicated at all what else do I believe like we need to get better with the testing methods now because it's still considered illegal and there's no way to test if you're under the influence or not um if you've got it in your system but not are affected as a medicinal user so if you get busted and you might not you may be higher than you should in my opinion you shouldn't drive but if you're like for example I could get into a car not be under the influence at all maybe I smoked it last night you know it's later in the day I'm feeling good had a coffee just we're not going about my day as I usually have been for the last few years and I could still have it in my bloodstream or myself it's my saliva they're not taking blood at the [ __ ] roadside then they can go oh you're under the influence there's no way to go well I got the pass and that gives me a way out but for the average Joe um there's no it's just yes or no it's not .05 you know so that's a big gray area but again I just avoid the issue altogether by driving as minimally as possible and I still get around perfectly fine or I never smoke whilst under because that's just again responsible usership um I mean and you compare that to things like Pharmaceuticals and things they don't test for but but definitely put you under the influence for like that's probably worse than weed driving maybe not by volume but I think by potential effects for sure like if you're on benzos or something like that um you could be [ __ ] like driving like a crazy person I was trying to look up the numbers of that before about how many um you know people are drug affected that un pharmaceutically but they don't test that so you wouldn't aren't see these men the systems the systems are against us ladies and gentlemen I mean if they don't test for it you can't have any numbers around it brutal okay so let's talk about the cans and cannots it's not just some free ticket to smoke and I do not treat it like as that either I have a little bit that's a lie but in future I will be much more uh prescient of the rules around it so let me explain to you what I can and cannot do Under This TGA approval interesting fact number one smoking marijuana is still illegal according to the TGA the TGA actually recommends that you vape your marijuana and do not smoke it because you are in still inhaling smoke and Ash and negative um you know negative molecules uh through smoking it and burning it as opposed to uh vaporizing it and getting the pure THC extract which is the medicinal part the rest of it's not burning your lungs out coughing it up been there many times so Vape don't smoke it uh I can Vape it in a smoking area if I want to because it's much more pure and the vapor is a lot less sensitive or capable of getting you intoxicated because it dissipates so quickly compared to smoke so the chance of second High secondhand highs or secondhand smoke is quite low with a vape I can carry it in public like regular medication that's probably the next so um so the best way to contextualize what this means for me medically is that to treat it like regular medication so I can carry it around on the street if I need to I can consume it in its prescribed way in public if I need to I can travel with it anywhere in Australia because it's a nationally recognized um permit from the TGA therapeutic therapeutic Goods Australia um and yeah it's just a very convenient ways of managed self-managing my own mental health um in a very convenient manner which is what I hope my [ __ ] tax dollars do for me right I mean I think about how much we know certain parts of the health system are being rooted right now it's nice to have it feel like it's coming back in my direction for a change because I'm [ __ ] in the top tax bracket right gotta get those [ __ ] medical dollars working for me so in closing guys medical marijuana is more accessible to you than you think go try it out um if you need help with resources please reach out let me give you some more of my direct experience so if this has been helpful for you or somebody else please um you know send them this episode I'm happy to be the Martyr and the messenger about the process and you know be that bleeding edge for you when it comes to medical marijuana um yeah give us a like follow subscribe on the interwebs particularly Tick Tock and YouTube if you're going to share it out try to use those platforms for me please appreciate it um next week again as you can tell here maybe I'll do a deep dive and make it nice and easy um I'll do a deep dive of the new space talk about it some of the books that I've got there some of the ideas and Concepts um I'll be a bit of fun again let's get to know each other in the process huh a little cute little date delicious all right folks I've been Jamil Raymond thank you for your time and attention binges and take care see you next week bye
k6T4LpsWI6Y,Travelling With Medical Cannabis in Australia (Locally) Explained by Lawyer Andrew Dowling,2021-05-10T04:05:34Z,hey everyone andrew dowling here i'm a practicing lawyer and the co-founder of ultmed and cbd pharmaceuticals today i'm with honolee and i'm talking about traveling within australia with medical cannabis i hope you find this video useful enjoy yeah they can so all states in australia um have now to varying degrees um got access to medicinal cannabis so because medicinal cannabis is a prescription only medicine at this point in time it's really advised that you know the patients do carry some level of paperwork with them to support that as long as they've got a prescription for it that extends also to um to flower as well um you know you might find yourself at an airport if you if you are carrying flower attracting the attention of you know of snipper dogs and the like but you know the whole way that our legal framework is is structured is that you in having a permit and having a doctor that's given that medical opinion that you need that product um and has provided you with a prescription you are permitted to have that product look it shouldn't uh i i'm you know i'm not i had to look around to try to do some research on this point um there's no guidelines that i was able to discern that are available on this but um i don't know if one method is is necessarily better or worse than than the other but the point is that you know whether you're based in in perth or wherever you are in australia and you're traveling somewhere else you are permitted to carry that because all state jurisdictions in australia have now been harmonized with the federal or the commonwealth narcotics act um so we we have a fully legal medicinal cannabis scheme in australia is the point and if you are obtaining it legally and have obtained it from a doctor through buyer a prescription then you are permitted to travel with it yeah so um when you know when patients obtain a product legally you know it has to come via the various pathways which are administered by the tga so that's the special access scheme or the authorized prescriber scheme but the end result of that from the patient side is that a prescription is sent to a pharmacy and you know that patient is effectively approved to have that medicine dispensed to them on advice from their doctor and i mentioned that the prescription label i think is really important i don't know why anyone would necessarily do this but if you were to say get the product and tear off that prescription label that's that actually lists your name and the dosage and all of that really key information i guess it's probably a bit difficult for um you know authorities to really see whether or not that's a black market product so i would i would highly recommend keeping that prescription i imagine that in some cases um authorities may wish to actually you know check that the person named on that prescription product is actually the person carrying it and seeking to travel with it so they might you know conduct further id checks um in terms of having a letter from a doctor i certainly couldn't find anything that was authoritative to suggest that that's a legal requirement in any sense but i think it's a good idea if um you know you know people often go to their doctor to get a sick certificate and they don't realize that you know doctors are there to help with a broad range of of patient inquiries so if you say to your doctor hey i'm actually due to travel to um you know to darwin for you know a couple of weeks on these dates and i'd like to travel with um with the medicinal cannabis that you provided me um so that i you know have documentation to show any authorities that that you know are interested in in seeing that um could you please provide me with a letter and i think you'd be hard-pressed to have your trading gp who's prescribed that product knock you back for that request well i suppose the yeah the scope of what they're allowed to carry is really the scope of what's in the prescriptions so whatever the doctor has prescribed is really what they're permitted to carry so i guess to the extent that if the device that's used to consume the product is authorized by the doctor yes and maybe that forms something of a gray area that might actually just be included in the doctor's letter you know the doctor might say i've prescribed him this flower product um i understand that they are using uh you know a vape to consume that flower i'm really not not entirely sure but i just know that from from a purely legal perspective the framework has been set up but you know they're all prescription medicines at this point in time we do facilitate um access to them and they are permitted for you know being taken between state and territory jurisdictions in australia um but the yeah the vaping question i think is probably best dealt with if it's if it doesn't form part of that what's within the scope of what's permitted by the doctor and prescribed by the doctor it's probably best dealt with in the accompanying or supporting letter that a doctor might write to it to assist a patient that is a really yeah that's a really interesting question um i look i mean if you have documents and and you this is a legal product i i mean you're that's the same as somebody taking a couple of neurofins outside the airport right like i mean obviously different in the sense that it's prescription but you know we don't necessarily um police that kind of activity however um you know i suppose to the extent that your smoking is harming other people if it's in the vicinity of other people i think it's really um you know that that could perhaps draw a bit of ire from from security staff at an airport or something like that i think i think your safest bet is to you know to travel with it but to consume it as privately and and you know discreetly um as you can purely so that you're not actually um having any other person ingest the the vapor or anything like that i mean you know when people do take other schedule 8 products or you know prescription products it's not as though you're you know having any of what they're having so i think it's um that's probably the best advice i can give but in terms of whether or not there are any hard and fast laws or rules on that um no nothing that i've come across today um i mean the packaging and the storage that the the medicines come in um you know the they're generally compliant um with you know australian packaging standards although they're not legally necessarily required to be if they're an unapproved therapeutic good but i won't take you down that rabbit hole but um needless to say they're usually um protected in a you know a sort of a you know an opaque um plastic bottle or it could be a glass bottle for a tincture um look it's not like uh we have laws with respect to firearms for example and it must be stowed you must you know stow your firearm if you have a gun license in in a specific cabinet and you know as far as i am aware i've never heard of travelers needing to take any specific storage facility that they they carry it in and the packaging um should suffice but um of course you know um this is really a you know very much a non-legal observation but i don't know if anyone's ever you know traveled with say a bottle of wine and didn't seal it properly and you know they they got to their destination with uh shiraz all over their shirts or something like that you know you don't want to be in a situation like that so i guess the best advice i can give to people traveling with a tincture bottle is just make sure it's you know bubble wrapped or something like that but no no no legal requirements for storage yeah um so i guess you know if you're first of all the product needs to be legal and in order for it to be a legal product it you know it will have to be supported with a prescription um and ideally you know i guess there's no such thing really as too much preparation um in this context especially given that you know we're still dealing in the um i guess the the night we're in the nascent stages of you know cannabis in australia so there will actually be people in law enforcement who are unfamiliar with the legal status of you know some some people might not even be aware that we have a framework that permits access to legal medicinal cannabis and so i think it's really important that you not only have a label a prescription medicine that's properly labeled that has your name you know what you've been prescribed as a dosage but also that you know where possible have have a letter from a doctor because that um also you know just provides further support and and you know that might that letter might and it's not it's certainly not a requirement but you know it might simply just be the doctor saying yeah i um prescribed um tom this product to treat insert name of condition um you know the dosage is x and and they just give that sort of that background information and um you know i monitor i'm you know seeing him that that sort of information like i don't know um it's not necessarily a case of less is more the more information i just feel like that that would help someone who is um you know going to be uh subject to stigma and

SvbXMkYRhL8,Medical cannabis driving laws are a ‘big problem’: Bladerstone,2022-05-25T12:22:42Z,the good news from the election is that you can't buy our democracy billionaire clive palmer spent nearly a hundred million dollars trying to get his party elected amazing amount result total flop not one seat in fact even in queensland palms home state has been beaten in the race for the final senate seat by the legalized cannabis party now it's true one nation's pauline hanson she's going to win in the end that seat that last seat but this still is the best queensland result for this legalized cannabis party and joining me is its party president plus the president of nimbin's hemp embassy michael balderson michael i guess neither of us ever thought that you would be in the bolt report but i'm so glad to see you clive palmer spent nearly a hundred million dollars what did you spend maybe well the the the fees to get everyone um registered were probably 30 grand and we maybe had another 20. so on the campaign we wouldn't have spent 20 grand so what does that tell you you're i'm trying to do your 70 000 tops against this 100 million what does that tell you i think you know i think it was very straightforward to people they see the name legalized cannabis sure there was quite a movement away from the major parties but the word is out there on cannabis now and a lot of people are using it they'd like to be able to grow their own at home because it's very expensive the legal one and you can't drive andrew so there's a lot of you know a lot of anger it's about the driving laws where even if people have got legal medical cannabis through a doctor you're still not allowed to drive that's a big problem now michael i don't want to hear so much about you know getting high on cannabis you know i'm not a fan of that i'm i worry it's a gateway drug don't let's not have an argument about that but that bit worries me but michael you know what's turned me towards your sort of thinking in one respect is that my uncle bert now i'm a science and evidence guy this is an anecdote it's to me it's not yet evidence had cancer it looked really really bad it looked really grim he took this and is cured i have no idea if it's true he took you know cannabis oil and swears by it and is about to turn 80. um do you hear many stories like that yeah there are lots of stories and look it's not going to be a cure-all but it's definitely got anti-cancer properties i reckon and there is quite a few stories and everyone seems to react differently to it a bit but seriously it's it's about i mean it has great curative powers but it's basically about pain relief and that's possibly the most profitable business on earth you know so the whole drug war is a bit of a fight about who's going to get the profits so there's a big pharmaceutical lobby making sure it's not legal and uh anyway i applaud you all was it an uncle good on him for being gamed yeah uncle yeah a lot of people oh bert's always been a little alternative yeah good on him now michael look at well look i couldn't have done i couldn't have done this segment without bringing you on uh he would have been on my back as well so um this is one for uncle burt and thank you so much michael balderson for coming on and let's see who knows you could have a senator with a stroke of luck we'll see thank you very much

MvbN_vJ3EwA,Review of medicinal cannabis in Australia,2022-05-31T15:50:18Z,today we're gonna be taking a much closer look at medicinal cannabis in australia and with more than a hundred thousand patients in the region it's definitely a market of interest however please be aware that you do need to have a prescription for cbd products in the region so the thc numbers are definitely not that high now all of this goes back to 2016 where tga approved the cultivation of medicinal cannabis in the region we do know to date that there's well over 45 medicinal cultivators as well as there are research permits in the region provided tj does not require all licence holders to be listed publicly so you can anticipate much more hidden from public scrutiny what we do know in the public space is that a lot of these cannabis cultivators are listed on the australian securities exchange which provides us with some good understanding of what is happening in the market along with data sources like fresh leaf analytics by rhys cohen that provides valuable insights into the region we saw as well that the tga approved through what's called special access provision at least 30 000 patients in the first three months of 2022 we also know that you can get access by an authorized subscriber scheme in the region so it's definitely a very fast enablement of access through prescriptions in addition i'd like to highlight the fact that if you're looking to participate within the australian market the one thing you need to pay close attention to is regulations are related to tgo 93 and 100. 93 is particularly important because it really outlines the details associated to what's required to get product into australia in addition we saw some updates throughout the year where they spoke about gmp approvals by vendors to be listed for the importation of cannabis into the region i ultimately have subsiste on today that's going to provide us some additional insights into the australian market as he's just recently returned and we had a chance to chat to him about visiting cultivators as well as dispensaries all pharmacies enjoy the episode hi sibs it's great to have you on today i know you recently just came back from australia where you were attending the conference and you had an opportunity to engage with you know cultivators in the region uh pharmacies in the region and maybe you can give us a bit of insight in terms of why you went out to australia and what were you looking to achieve in the other southern hemisphere country sure um always great to be on uh jeff so um australia is um i think one of the most important legal canvas markets uh in in the world today um you know australia is probably where or south africa probably is four or five years uh behind where australia is currently today so australia's got over a hundred thousand medical cannabis patients growing very very quickly on a month-to-month basis um and is actually one of the most um accommodative jurisdictions in terms of importation of cannabis and also one of the most well funded and most well established uh cannabis industries in the world so australia's importing cannabis exporting cannabis processing uh investing in research and in many ways uh is um a much more mature um cannabis uh uh economy versus south africa south africa and the studio so from our perspective uh we need a lot of people that we've been talking to and working with for some time but also expand um our um sort of network within that market and also get a much more granular understanding of the mechanics of how that that industry works uh to sort of have a good foundation for us to further expand our work within south africa and support uh south african um uh cannabis operators enter the australian market and also help uh sort of position some australian players who are interested in investing and participating in the african market um you know really kind of have an understanding of what the lay of the land is here awesome excellent and i just want to give some context there so in australia when we talk about a hundred thousand patients uh it is important to remember that uh cbd products do fall under the prescription or the special access provision so a lot of that can be cpd products not just don't think of it as an audience it's a hundred thousand thc scripts that are being filled um there's really two routes to market there there's the special access provision b and there's obviously the authorized prescriber scheme which is also being implemented and moving forward and and when you are you're right there services over 300 products that are kind of approved in the market there there's different levels of approval so i won't talk about like not necessarily like a traditional marketing authorization but there's a range of options and there's a lot of interplay between south africa and australia and it always has been and i want to ask you the next question in terms of like did you have an opportunity because i know you were there for conference did you also get a chance to see some of the local cultivators see their facilities what did you pick up in terms of are they doing things differently to how we do uh what was your view on that yeah so we're quite fortunate in that we actually interacted with quite a lot of local um cultivators and operators and and managed to actually visit a facility pretty close to to brisbane i think um there was a couple of things that really stood out and uh you know that really um um gave me a sense that we still have quite a long way to go look we have a long and um rich history in terms of the cultivation of cannabis in south africa and africa but to understand cannabis as a um medicine how to produce that how to um you know sort of ensure quality how to be innovative and how to stay ahead of the curve it's a completely different skill set that i had the sense that um let's say this one cultivator we visited in australia had there was a very strong focus on innovation um agile learning um in terms of the operation and the process uh as well as um scaling in order to meet domestic um demand um you know the the other key lesson i think from sort of the facility visit and sort of engaging with a lot of the local licensed producers was just how much collaboration was happening in that market versus uh you know south africa and lesotho um on on the visit we actually met another uh cultivator that we had been speaking to for for some time uh who who just happened to also be visiting the facility and engaging with what would quote unquote be one of his competitors and for for me that's uh something that was extremely you know in some ways inspiring to see because i think in the african cannabis industry we do tend to be very siloed and everyone tends to hold their cards very very close to their chest and so um in this sort of early stage of the industry where collaboration can help in the collective problem solving process of the industry i think we are a little bit handicapped in that um operators are not that trusting of each other and you know and understandably so in terms of human age etc but i think that's one of the um barriers that we're going to have to break in the african cannabis industry in order for the industry to advance at a much more sort of compelling pace and to solve collective challenges and issues uh that will actually allow the industry to get on its uh on its both on both of its feet awesome awesome yeah i agree with that i mean we want to see uh more collaborative effort i mean to problem solve by yourself is one thing to work with everyone's problem solve i mean if the market is really out there we've got to fulfill it um then you've got it you've got to work together to understand what are the problems like learn from someone else's permitting issue you know what was the delay where were the hiccups what testing labs the best to recheck your results you know is there other options and i want to ask as well because i mean there is this aspect of in terms of commercialization for access um you know with over a hundred thousand patients in the region the sas b uh sas b approvals is always like on record highs um what was your i know you also said to me i know we spoke about it briefly you mentioned you went to one of these uh this pharmacies that dispenses uh so it's not a traditional dispensary like in the us but it seemed like they were really busy in terms of like patients getting access yeah i think um that was you know definitely an eye-opening experience because um we were sort of quite you know fortunate to be able to actually spend extensive time with the team um managing the pharmacy uh kind of towards the close of business and but i think what was absolutely insane was just how many scripts they were processing and working through and you know having to wait for this very long line to finally you know get uh you know get serviced and you know before being able to to to meet the team but what was quite phenomenal was looking at the broad range of products um in in the market where those products were coming from um how you know sort of patients were discerning between um various brands and and reasons for making certain decisions um you know and also the um you know the important role that a a framework that all the stakeholders understand um plays in in sort of the growth of the industry so you know for example that particular pharmacy um had a backlog of hundreds if not thousands of of of scripts that they actually needed to uh to to fulfill um but then you know you had a situation where individuals uh that were patients um had confidence in in sort of the um framework under which these products were being approved um and um and individuals where you know sort of cannabis was never an option or even a thought uh were now you know leaning on cannabis to deal with you know a whole broad range of medical issues uh chronic pain um uh and uh you know inflammation induced medical conditions and so forth so in many ways um i kind of saw you know sort of what south africa can do if we sort of also had a very um you know sort of well-communicated framework um sort of a monograph to help with uh sort of ensuring a standard is met by local cultivators um and then also the um multiplier effect that comes with a really well set up and uh trusted uh framework by which patients can access medical uh cannabis it was really eye-opening and um and a lot of of of inspiration that i think we should take as a south african and in africa in terms of domestic frameworks and domestic access that will truly allow the industry to um you know to begin to to piece together from some of these engagements with different players in the supply chain and so forth is that um australia is one of the most active um uh you know sort of jurisdictions when it comes to the global cannabis industry so australian companies are exporting to europe they're making acquisitions and uh you know in denmark let's say um importing from different parts of the world but that um the fact that domestic industry and and the need to service that domestic industry really creates a um a lot of um you know sort of strong foundational uh touch points that allow that industry to actually grow and evolve and learn um quicker than than an industry that's only set up for exports as an example um and so the conversations that you know um cannabis the cannabis uh you know sort of uh stakeholders or operators are having are sort of three five ten years ahead of where we are right now you know talking about collective r d initiatives where the government can fund the r d because a lot of these uh startups and cannabis don't have the resources to invest in very expensive trials etc but in a partnership with government and the sector this ip can then be sort of developed by these private companies that can export the iep to other countries and other parts of the world so it kind of really puts a spotlight on the importance of um sort of let's say um taking really important uh really key steps in the developing a domestic industry which then adds fuel to the ability of that industry to um to really learn and develop and integrate globally and you know ultimately over a 5 10 15 year period that is the some of the core ingredients that will allow that that country to be a global leader when it comes to to the cannabis industry so i think it's some very very important lessons for us as a sort of south african associate in africa uh in terms of um shifting a gear up in the way that we're looking to develop our our industry now awesome i think you've covered the i was going to ask you about learn like points of improvement and i think you've kind of really comprehensively covered it i mean tga who's the regulator it's our version of sapra in australia always been very for i would say compared like very transparent i'm sure these people in australia still feel tga can always be more transparent as it is of all regulators and every jurisdiction but it's one way i think there's been clear guidelines tgo 193 you know the expectations from in terms of gmp certificates that was communicated earlier this year so i think that's been good i know also australia's got a very easy well let's just call it a they do they do clinical trials really well so in terms of like the implementation we do it as well in south africa pretty well but australia is also known for doing good clinical work uh for countries like europe and the usa so they've got that aspect right i mean it is a bit overburdening that the cbd products have to move through special access or or for us prescribers but in that sense they've made it all pretty clean medical in a traditional sense and that's forced them to really deal with approvals which is why it's impressive to see that they can get 100 000 patients on board it which makes them quite a big sector in terms of international access and we'll see just because they're not really distinguishing too much between a cbd and a thc product it's the same it's a medicinal product in their view i think we will see probably adult use uh policies coming down the line we saw the new zealand referendum some years back just fell by a small margin so i think australia we've got there's good learning lessons there and i think it's one way i also see good partnerships uh between south africa and australia for the southern hemisphere so i'm really excited to see how this develops and sips i know that we've got a lot we want to still talk about so i'm looking forward to discussing you know there's little there's a little green pharma there's epsilon there's a lot of interesting companies out there in australia that are breaking or making big news uh like you mentioned denmark having acquired a sites arts in the nordic region so it's really exciting to talk some more about this but sips i'm glad we had you on to quickly capture you know the highlights of your trip to australia and excited to see future collaborations that you'll be facilitating between south african australian cultivators and exporters definitely no very very excited about um future collaboration between uh the two jurisdictions um and yeah i think there's these you know these these these collaborations will come at quite a lot of different levels um and um i think some of our local players are well positioned to to to execute on on some of these and and also a lot of the australian players as well very excited about um the opportunity to collaborate more with south african and lesotho based cannabis companies awesome excellent

specialist he has worked in aboriginal health hiv prevention and in the drug and alcohol sector richard is a strong advocate for drug law reform many thanks richard thanks so much and g'day everybody let me first acknowledge uh the traditional owners of the lands on which we all meet right across the country uh and thanks so much for uh inviting me to really give what uh i wanna give a very personal perspective of an issue that i've been involved with for for a number of years so i'm um somebody who trained as a gp uh somebody who worked um in the um area of public health and then moved into politics and and i did that because i i really wanted to address a number of issues that sort of set outside the um you know the sphere of influence you have you have as a doctor i'm not going to give you a technical presentation about the pharmacology of medicinal cannabis or going to great detail about the evidence base and so on you'll probably get a more technical overview from from me you know so i'll leave that to him but what you'll get from me is a sort of broad overview and and um some of the issues around access and and and the regulatory framework and how how that's been managed at the moment so um why does medicinal cannabis actually work it's interesting because when i trained as a medical student um the only real the message i got about cannabis was that it's harmful product um it's illegal uh stay away from it um we didn't even know there was something called the endocannabinoid system that's emerged only recently sort of through the 90s we came to understand that the body has a system which makes its own cannabis like molecules and they help to modulate a range of functions in the body so they become a way of sending messages to different cells in the body and they perform lots of different functions um so it really was as we started to understand more about this endocannabinoid system that we came to understand how cannabis interacted with that and how it actually produced a range of effects some of them are desirable and therapeutic there's an analogy with other drugs like opiates opiates are drugs that our body also makes we make our endogenous version of those drugs when you hear something with the word endogenous it just means our own body makes them and we have receptors which are basically the the part of the body that that those endogenous opiates bind to and that produces a series of responses and that's why drugs like codeine and pathadine and morphine work uh to reduce pain is because they're working on our own natural system uh that helps to modulate uh things like pain so we had an analogy the endocannabinoid system uh was a system that our body has which produces these molecules that are called cannabinoids and they're basically uh similar in structure to the drugs that we now know as medicinal cannabis now we've known for a long time next we've known for a long time that medicinal cannabis is effective and indeed it's cannabis has been used for thousands of years um and there's a long history of use and some of it uh in the case of it's used as treatments um through some traditional cultures and has been for for a long period of time um what we've learned uh over recent years is that the evidence base is now building for a range of conditions but it's important to say the evidence is still contested in some areas is some debate and it's also important to recognize when we talk about evidence sometimes we're having different conversations because within the medical sphere the gold standard for medical evidence is the randomized double-blind trial and we haven't uh had as many of those when it comes to medicinal cannabis uh as we've had for other well-known drugs but what we do know is that there have been other types of studies done as well as double-blind trials which are certainly increasing in frequency now but case studies can actually help us learn about the effect of particular substances of particular uh therapeutic agents so and and we can't dismiss the fact that a drug that has a long history of use many of the sort of unforeseen side effects that we might see with a new drug really aren't an issue there's also the question about what you're measuring when you're talking about the evidence of where the medicinal cannabis works are you talking about the whole plant or are you talking about the uh different compounds within the plant so the plant medicinal cannabis contains a number of different compounds it contains thc which is the substance that can make can alter your consciousness make you high as as it's described this cbd cannabidiol and there are other cannabinoids and indeed other substances within the medicinal cannabis plant and some people argue that it's the interaction of these different compounds that produces its effect and to complicate things further there are different concentrations in different strains of medicinal cannabis plants when it comes to thc cbd and the other compounds so some are high in thc some are low in thc and it depends on the therapeutic effect that you want so what we do know now is that of course sorry to complicate the matter even further is sometimes um we're talking about a medicinal cannabis that's consumed as an edible product because you can eat it but it can also be vaporized and smoked and so when we talk about the evidence we need to be really clear what are we measuring are we measuring the whole plant or are we talking about individual compounds and what's the method of ingestion what's the dosage all of those things are absolutely critical and because there's so much variation in terms of what has been tested if you like what's been assessed the evidence remains in some areas unclear in other areas contested however we do know that for some therapeutic conditions it's of a tremendous benefits the most commonly used or most common reasons for its use are for things like um to prevent nausea and as an appetite stimulant so for example people living with aids found that it worked as an appetite stimulant um as well as preventing the nausea that comes from many of the drugs that people have been provided we know this evidence around muscle spasms and for conditions like ms there's also now evidence but this is a much more complicated picture about its using pain conditions neuropathic pain cancer pain and other forms of pain now many people i'm sure this will be for many people listening of particular interest and i'm sure many of you also know that pain's very complicated because there are so many factors that contribute to the experience of pain but there is little doubt that many patients who do experience severe joint pain for example do find it a very useful addition to their treatment indeed we're now seeing that in some cases it's being worked as a substitute that's been used as a substitute for opiate treatment which carries its own set of problems look it's also fair to say that many of the advocates for medicinal cannabis talk about its properties across a range of areas including as a drug that fights cancer we do know that in vitro in the laboratory setting there might be some evidence that it has an effect but so far in practice uh we haven't seen that and uh and there's much more work to be done before we can say that it has a beneficial effect in that area we know that um it's also a drug that produces side effects now um someone uh once wisely said that there's no such thing as a side effect all drugs have effects uh there are the effects that um are of interest uh to people and if that's the major effect of a drug and it has few of the things we don't want then we call that um a medicine but ultimately all drugs have effects they have a range of effects and medicinal cannabis is no different um apart from some of the things that i described earth earlier in terms of the beneficial properties that we look for preventing nausea and appetite stimulant muscle spasms neuropathic pain of course epilepsy particularly particular forms of epilepsy in very young children we again we know that there is evidence emerging in that sphere as well but we also know that it can cause psychological a psychological response so the thc for some people is a pleasant side effect and indeed it's why it uh it is why we um are so being used as a recreational substance um but of course for others uh that altered state of consciousness can be problematic particularly for high thc preparations it can produce anxiety paranoia and lethargy in some people so um the you know like all drugs there are desirable effects and for some people undesirable effects the question around psychosis which is when i was training as a as a gp um was one that was again contested and it is complicated it doesn't appear that there's any strong correlation we do know that the issue around psychosis uh is as much around the proportion of thc and cbd and in fact the interesting thing here is that cbd which is within the medicinal cannabis plant is now being used or trialled um and there's uh there are some studies underway as a treatment for psychosis so the picture there again is complicated i think one thing to say is of course if you're a young person or got a very strong family history of psychosis it's something that should be avoided unless you have a a thorough consultation with somebody who's very experienced in in the field um in terms of safety uh again um it's it's important to look at this drug relative to other drugs there's no perfect drug some all drugs as i said have a range of effects one of the things about cannabis is there's no overdose potential so people don't die um they don't overdose from uh medicinal cannabis that's a huge positive when you consider that opiates are a major cause of of overdose and indeed in the u.s uh the numbers are upwards of 60 000 people per year who who um succumb so uh that's by no means trivial and and medicinal cannabis simply does not have any overdose potential i mean you can drugs like paracetamol which we think of as very very safe do um are they very safe drugs and take it when taking the right quantities but when taken in the wrong quantities can actually cause very severe damage to the liver so when we compare the harms of medicinal cannabis to other commonly used drugs and particularly its potential for overdose i think it's reasonable to say it's a relatively safe drug so there i was i suppose learning a bit uh learning more about this drug um as as this evidence sort of developed and ian will go into much more detail around the current state of play there but what was very clear to me was here we had medication that was providing benefit to people it was a drug that in terms of relative harms was uh less harmful than alcohol uh alcohol has a range of harms that simply don't exist for cannabis this was a drug that we knew had therapeutic properties and yeah and we also knew that many thousands and i've only learned i suppose through my time involved in this subject how just how many people are accessing it illicitly and being treated like criminals and while that was happening here in australia what we saw around the world was a number of jurisdictions starting to make medicinal cannabis available and so i became increasingly interested in what we needed to do here in australia to provide people with access to this drug knowing that it was of benefit to them and that's where i learned about dan haslam now lucy haslam may be known to some of you if you've been involved in this area for a while but lucy became involved with medicinal cannabis because her son dan was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer as a 20 year old young man one of the problems with his um treatment was he was getting just awful nausea and he was on having chemotherapy as a 20 year old kid he's getting not just nausea after treatment but he his nausea became so bad that he started to get anticipatory noise he would get nauseous even before treatment started just knowing what was coming up he was on some very heavy-duty anti-nausea drugs his mum who was a nurse um and had no experience with medicinal cannabis his father ironically was a a policeman involved in the drug squad they were both recommended medicinal cannabis from someone they gave it to him he got immediate relief and indeed it improved his quality of life immeasurably he started his nausea was under control his appetite came back and tragically he died in his mid-20s but his quality of life was significantly improved yet he was being treated like a criminal and so were many other families who were using it to treat any number of conditions so there i was i suppose in the senate faced with somebody who was uh it was a doctor and had uh an interest in in this area and had been watching the the field from a distance coming to learn about the stories of people who were getting benefit from the drug drug that had been used for many many years knowing that we've now got an endocannabinoid system that that is designed specifically it would seem for this drug to work on us we had gps who are becoming more interested in the field here in australia and yet people were being treated like criminals so the decision that needed to be made is what do we what do we do next what's what what is the way of trying to drive change in this area we weren't seeing it from within the pharmaceutical industry because there were a number of things working against the development of medicinal cannabis as a conventional pharmaceutical drug firstly there's a lot of stigma and controversy associated with its use but most importantly but this uh pharmaceutical companies rely on getting a patent and protecting their intellectual property to justify investment in new drugs so you have to be able to develop a new drug protect that development and you make money off that intellectual property but how do you get a patent for something that's effectively a natural plant that can be grown in a backyard where people can can grow it easily where there's a thriving black market and indeed in some cases we're going to compete against some of the other drugs that you make drugs like opiates for example which have proven to be very very profitable so there are a number of incentives working against the pharmaceutical pharmaceutical industry developing new products there are a couple of products available in australia but they're very expensive and for very limited indications so what we did was have a look at what other countries were doing and they recognized that with medicinal cannabis it had some unique properties in that a it was a plant easily grown illegal but with major therapeutic benefits and so they decided to set up an independent regulator statutory body responsible for regulating the use of medicinal cannabis products in a medical setting and um in many jurisdictions what they've done is said we're going to set up this special expert independent group and regulate it so we developed a bill a piece of legislation that would effectively do the same thing here in australia by way i mean um myself and then recruited uh labour party co-sponsor a liberal party co-sponsor national party co-sponsor and got independence also to agree common sense i think everybody recognized we needed to ensure that people could get access to this product and we took that bill around the country we had a number of senate hearings we worked as i said with politicians from right across the political spectrum and eventually we managed to get enough support that the government decided it would act however what the government decided to do and in retrospect i think it's been a very significant mistake they decided to use the existing regulator for medicines rather than do what our bill had proposed which was set up a standalone independent regulator specifically for medicinal cannabis and what that's meant is that access to medicinal cannabis is still wanting for many people so what the government has done is they've got the existing regulator called the therapeutic goods administration of the tga and what they do is they treat all drugs to be used in australia have to be registered and for them to get registered what usually happens is a pharmaceutical company puts in an application puts in a an evident a dossier of evidence if you like on the efficacy of the drug whether it works the safety manufacturing quality all of those things are done by a pharmaceutical company and a drug that's registered however we know as i've just said with medicinal cannabis pharmaceutical companies weren't lining up to do that and as a result what happened was we've got the current state of play where the tga has said well we're happy to register a product but we need it to be put through by a pharmaceutical company well that wasn't working so what the tga this body that regulates all medicines in australia has decided has has done is they've approved the use of medicinal cannabis only when a doctor requests special permission so there's something that the tga can use that's called the special access scheme it's for any drug that doesn't have registration in australia and that special access scheme if you're somebody with a terminal illness and somebody who's likely to die within six months a doctor can make an application and will get it however if your patient's not in that category a doctor needs to justify to the tga why this drug should be used and why other medicines in australia are not clinically suitable they have to go through a few hoops now once that's done unfortunately in some states there's another layer of bureaucracy that sits over the top of that and there has been some streamlining of that but um only very recently uh what needed to happen was then you needed to get approval from most state jurisdictions so from the perspective of the doctor if somebody comes in and wants to wants to try medicinal cannabis they may have neuropathic pain muscular spasms they may have joint pain the doctor first has to be a doctor that's interested in exploring this area and it's fair to say that there are many older conservative doctors who just simply are not interested and and don't uh accept that it's a legitimate treatment i think most doctors now accept that it has a role but doctors are still firstly finding it hard to access independent sources of education and advice many doctors are rightly skeptical and want until they are able to access that information we haven't got any gold standard for training in australia yet and then even if you do decide that you want to go down the path of prescribing it what you need to do is you need to then put an application into the tga so from the perspective of a doctor you can write a script which could be filled in a couple of minutes or for another drug or you can decide to go down this route which is going to be much more time consuming and it might not be something that you're convinced about anyway or have much experience in just too hard we won't do it so we've got a major problem at the moment with people being able to access it so the um uh the the next issue of course is that we still don't have products in australia that are available um in a way that's affordable for many people products are not subsidized at the moment and because uh they're not registered for use in australia they haven't been through that tga process there's no way of getting a subsidy like the pbs does for many other drugs and so the the many of the preparations are simply out of reach for many people so in light of all of that we had a senate inquiry the senate inquired which i chaired and we looked at what are the things that needed to change and really it's many of the things that i've already touched on already and i'm just looking at the time so i won't go into into great detail but a lot more needs to be done around educating medical professionals and providing them with independent accessible information should they need it and that's a unfortunately something that hasn't been done well the medical colleges many of them don't have the resources or indeed the commitment to want to take this on and um and it's really up to the initiative of individual doctors um the uh senate inquiry also interesting if you're interested in this by the way just google medicinal cannabis a senate inquiry and what you'll get is a an inquiry that there's really only one inquiry it talks about patient access so the piece around educating doctors was recommended they made it very clear that there needs to be an education campaign with the community they also made it very clear that what we should do is provide a pathway for doctors to get the appropriate training and then not have to use the tga approval process it's basically a script that should be written like any other script is written within the clinical setting and interestingly recommendation 5 says if all of this fails what we should do is have a independent regulator because it's clear that the current mechanism for deciding how and when it's used just isn't working and uh and i think we're so that the the the final slide which is where to from here is one that we need um to be i think working in two very distinct areas i think what we have to do is uh make sure that through the medical colleges um with the support of the federal government that we get a an accredited um a training program for gps who are interested in providing it and we do this already there are examples of this already we do this with methadone for example which was a drug that's used for people who are opiate dependent uh if you to become a methadone prescriber uh you do a short course and that allows you to be able to write a prescription uh in a way that uh in in some ways you write them for other drugs well there's no reason why we can't have that with medicinal cannabis and cut the application to the tga out of the equation it will give gps it will give gps some confidence that they need to know that they're up to date with the most recent literature and it would mean that um patients know uh who would who can provide it uh and who has the the knowledge and expertise in this field and i'm hopeful that ultimately we get the vast majority of gp's comfortable uh in ensuring that it is uh prescribed um if that's if i think we're back here uh in the next year and there is still no um advance uh in terms of gps being able to access information and prescribe it easily then i think it's there's no choice for the government but to recognize that this needs an independent regulatory framework and we return to the principle of a independent regulator but let me just finish with this we have a substance that we know alleviates pain and suffering for many many people we have a substance that has no potential for overdose we have a substance that when it's compared to other products that are uh particularly uh prescription medications is far safer and yet uh we have made it much more difficult to prescribe than much more dangerous drugs we have made it very difficult for patients to afford and we've for some of them treated them like criminals and given them criminal records for accessing what is a medicine and that's wrong and it needs to change and it's why i've been involved in the area for a number of years and why i hope to continue to stay involved until anybody who wants to try medicinal cannabis from the perspective of a health condition for which they might get benefit is able to do it easily and affordably that's really what my goal is is here thanks very much for sharing your incredible experience um and knowledge from particularly your time in parliament and and and you know your involvement with the senate inquiry and so on so um and and the fact that you're willing to stay involved in relation to this issue i think is is a wonderful thing i'd now like to introduce professor ian mcgregor ian is professor of psychopharmacology nhmrc principal research fellow and academic director of the lambert initiative for cannabinoid therapeutics in the brain and mind center at the university of sydney australia ian's historical research has focused on the effects of drugs on the brain and behavior and more recently on the discovery and development of new medications for the treatment of disease ian has a strong interest in the area of medicinal cannabis with more than 20 years of experience in cannabinoid research the lambert initiative for cannabinoid therapeutics was formed in 2015 with a gift of unprecedented generosity from the lambert family to the university of sydney the lambert initially aims to fast-track research into the therapeutic benefits of cannabinoids in various disease states and the lambda initiative is also engaged at a social and political level to improve community and professional education around medicinal cannabis and to bring about evidence-based regulatory change and improve patient access so ian i'll hand the microphone and the camera over to you thanks very much ian well thank you very much jane and it's wonderful to be here tonight and thanks for the opportunity to deliver the quad love lecture for 2020 alongside richard and a wonderful job richard i thoroughly enjoyed your talk and congratulations on all the wonderful work you've done in the medicinal cannabis space over recent years it's very much appreciated by patients and scientists alike and just a few disclosures there are mostly around companies whose products we've used for various clinical trials in the medicinal cannabis space i'd really like to start by thanking barry joy lambert who in 2015 gave this amazing gift to the university of sydney to establish the lambert initiative for cannabinoid therapeutics a kind of purpose-built research center for medicinal cannabis at the university of sydney and their story is a very interesting one and it relates to their granddaughter caitlin who suffers from a very severe form of epilepsy called rabbi syndrome and caitlyn was a very sick little girl aged about three her father michael lambert discovered that giving her what was then an illicit cannabinoid product that was sourced from denmark he was bringing it in illegally had a transformational effect on caitlyn's health and she went from having hundreds of seizures a week to having no seizures and essentially turned an incredible corner in terms of her health and well-being and she continues to have quite an incredible trajectory for a child with travis syndrome often they have severe disability moving forward many of them die before adulthood and caitlyn is doing extremely well and continues to do very well on cannabinoid medications and this story was what inspired the lamberts to set up the lambert initiative at the university of sydney by the way michael lambert did appear in court for his sins of um apparent sins of illegally procuring cannabis substances for his very old daughter and that reflects on richard's story that a lot of people are still criminalized for trying to help their loved ones in this space unfortunately barry has gone on to actually take a business interest in medicinal cannabis uh he didn't know much about cannabis in 2015 but has since formed a company called eco-fiber which sells and markets very successfully a range of mostly cbd rich products into the american market and uh i have no opinionary interest with eco fiber but it's interesting how he turned the story into something of an amazing commercial opportunity we are set up in the brain and mind center at the university of sydney we have terrific labs there where we do a whole range of different research projects and have terrific fun actually with a team of mostly very young scientists doing incredible work and our overall theme is to try and develop novel cannabinoid-based therapeutics to help alleviate human suffering it's a very exciting time to be in cannabis research of course cannabis itself is nothing new as a therapeutic as a 6 000 year history and and the current year of prohibition the past 90 years are basically a historical anomaly compared to the rich history that cannabis has as a therapeutic what recent times have taught us is a kind of advanced complexity around this ancient plant we're kind of in the era of cannabis 2.0 we now understand that there's more than 140 different molecules in the plant that we might call cannabinoids most don't actually get you stoned most they're not intoxicating but a lot of them appear to have therapeutic potential and different types of cannabis plants are enriched in different types of cannabinoids there are other bioactive components in the plant which include terpenoids and flavonoids and this plant seems to have a privileged interface with what we call the endocannabinoid system of the brain and body which richard referred to in his talk the endocannabinoid system is an incredible new frontier in pharmacology and physiology we knew nothing about this system 20 years ago and now we're learning a great deal about it there's basically no process in your brain and body that doesn't involve the endocannabinoid system there's a lot to learn about the system but it modulates very basic processes metabolism inflammation psychological processes like anxiety and fear metabolic processes and also heavily involved in disease states as well and we're trying to understand how the endocannabinoid system might change as a result of people being afflicted with various diseases and conditions uh two of the major endocannabinoid molecules and this this is quite technical but it's worth knowing their names amandamide and 2ag these are incredibly important molecules in your body it doesn't matter where we look in the body you'll find endocannabinoids you'll find the endocannabinoid system you'll find the nandamide in 2ag so if you look in skin it's full of endocannabinoids and various proteins that we interact with if you look in the gut then you have endocannabinoids galore there if you look at joints you know for example your knee joint the synovium there's a very complex endocannabinoid system there and this brings forward the idea that if we can modulate the endocannabinoid system and it appears the cannabis plant has privileged access to that system then you can gain a great therapeutic advantage in terms of trying to alleviate disease and suffering we're also using our knowledge of the endocannabinoid system to better understand what are very widely used traditional medicines so we learned recently for example that one of the actions that panadol has not the toxic action on the liver but its effects on on pain and inflammation seems to involve fairly direct modulation of the endocannabinoid system so when you're taking panadol you're actually really taking a cannabinoid not a lot of people realize that um another really interesting thing is that people vary in terms of their endocannabinoid systems this is a fascinating story from scotland my home country of a woman who had a funny genetic mutation which meant that her endocannabinoid system was overactive she had huge concentrations of endocannabinoids in her blood in her brain and her body and they discovered this because she went in to have fairly serious surgery for osteoarthritis and the doctors soon realized that this woman had really severe joint degeneration normally that they associated with a great deal of pain but she seemed to feel no pain from her condition whatsoever and when they probed her surgical history they found that she'd have various dental and other medical procedures it would normally be very painful but she never required any pain relieving medication when she was cooking in the kitchen she'd often burn herself and she'd only realize she was burning herself because she smelled her own flesh burning that's fairly grotesque by the testament to how she felt very little pain and she could eat the hottest of chili peppers without any discomfort when they asked her about anxiety and depression she never feared anything and on scale psychometric skills she scored very low for anxiety and depression what cases like this tell us is that if you have up regulation of the endocannabinoid system you seem to be able to make pain disappear and also alleviate anxiety and depression and that gives us great hope that some of the cannabinoids present in the plant may actually have this direct line to the endocannabinoid system to cause pain relieving and also major effects on anxiety and depression so at the lambert initiative we're trying to deconvolute the plant we're trying to interrogate the actions of these endocannabinoids and without getting too technical i'll tell you that these days a lot of uncovering of interactions between drugs and their targets is done in computers so we do a lot of high-end computational work modeling how cannabinoids interact with cells in the body and their receptors and we also physically do work where we look at these cannabinoid effects on receptors particularly receptors that we know are related to pain and inflammation and epilepsy and other medical conditions we also run a lot of cellular models of disease so we can take cells from the knee for example from patients that have arthritis that show inflammation and we can apply cannabinoids to these cells in a test tube and find out which cannabinoids are best in terms of reducing inflammation we do the same with cancer we kill cancer cells routinely with various cannabinoids and also we have many brains actually from epilepsy patients which show abnormal electrical activity don't worry the brains are conscious but we can use these brains to look at how cannabinoids interact with epilepsy type electrical activity in these brains and we also run animal models we have mice that have the same sort of epilepsy that caitlin does caused by a genetic mutation and also animal models of arthritis and cancer addiction and that allows us to very quickly uh try and find the best cannabinoids for various disease conditions but we also do a lot of work with humans we do a lot of clinical trials and we partner with various minister cannabis companies and universities around the world to run these clinical trials and as richard mentioned in his talk there's still a lot of uncertainty about the evidence base for medicinal cannabis and the best way to convince doctors to prescribe medicinal cannabis is to provide them good quality evidence from clinical trials and we've recently continued trials for example in youth anxiety and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and effects on driving as well in the netherlands we've got currently running trials and things like tourette's syndrome insomnia exercise and endurance we also have a number of trials launching soon richard mentioned the antipsychotic effects of certain cannabinoids we're involved in a big study down in melbourne that's launching soon around that also there seems to be effects on addiction say alcohol dependence and methamphetamine dependence we're running trials on on these conditions and also pain with spinal cord injury and sleep so there's an awful lot of exciting clinical research to be done and we're very happy and privileged to be involved in that research and if you're interested in getting involved in clinical trials at the landmarks initiative then please go to our website and you can actually put your name down or on the list or yeah as someone that would like to be recruited for these trials another thing that we do is politics and policy that's a picture of me and my colleague jonathan arnold about to appear in front of richard's senate inquiry and that was a very important landmark in patient access so we do a lot of work on that and a lot of our research is around the kind of subterranean world of people in australia who can't access official medicinal cannabis and are using illicit cannabis and i'll talk a little bit more about that later on this evening another thing we do is we hear a lot of patient stories my email inbox is often uh full of stories from patients who've kind of reached the end of the road in terms of what conventional prescription medications can offer them this is an example here my husband's 55 years old he's in constant pain he's crushed vertebrae extensive arthritis bulging discs sleep apnea he cries through the night because he's in so much pain he's on the highest doses of pain relief legally allowed and the only pain specialist has just left our country town the current pain release not working i'm seeking alternatives uh would he be a good candidate for your studies if there are any trials for pain relief coming up could you please consider him so these are the sort of heart-rending stories that we often hear and we're very very keen to try and alleviate this extreme suffering that so many people experience in australia and we're keen to see whether medicinal cannabis offers a root away from that suffering and this is typical of the medications that our chronic pain patient is on you can see a pre-gabbling you can see heavy-duty opioids you can see ibuprofen and aspirin as well so there's not much more that conventional medications can offer to this per patient so what do we do in this case how do you access medicinal cannabis in australia well as richard outlined there's a range of products that can be obtained but it's something of a convoluted process because these are mostly unregistered medicines and you have to use a special access scheme from the tga to get hold of them nonetheless there's still 60 000 approvals that have been granted since this scheme started in late 2016 involving around 25 000 patients and 1500 doctors we were very frustrated through 2016 17 and 18 because the numbers were so low but there's been quite a remarkable increase in numbers particularly over the last year and a half and i think the latest figures in september there was more than six 000 approvals and this what this tells patients is basically it is possible for you to get hold of medicinal cannabis and many other people are the sort of conditions that people are getting approvals for are quite varied but as you'll see from this graph the vast majority are actually for chronic pain and there's also cancer pain neuropathic pain migraine fibromyalgia in the top 10 and anxiety is the second most common condition for which people get an approval for medicinal cannabis products a revolution in some ways has occurred with cannabis clinics opening in a lot of capital cities and this kind of guarantees a patient that as long as you're prepared to outlay 300 or 400 dollars you can see a doctor who's specialized and knowledgeable about the medicinal cannabis area and the problem is of course if you go to your regular gp he or she may or may not be educated around medicinal cannabis and a lot of them are still very uncertain and reluctant to prescribe so going it bypasses that process i have no financial interest in any of the clinics but i think it's important for you to know that that is an option if you're interested in trying medicinal cannabis and you can certainly find out information about these clinics on the web there's a wide range of products available and from your doctor through the special access scheme and most of them contain thc or cbd or a mixture of these two cannabinoids and there's actually quite a bamboozling array of products there's more than 150 medicinal cannabis products that are currently available in the australian market and medicinal cannabis is not necessarily what you think if you're thinking of old style cannabis that you roll into a joint or whatever more than 50 50 of the products are oils so you take these orally uh rather than smoking them there's also a fair number of capsules 16 of the products are capsules there's also oral sprays as well that you spray into your mouth there is cannabis flower material available about 17 of the current products are what we call cannabis flower or cannabis floss but rather than rolling them into a joint in the old traditional style these are vaporized usually so you get a vaporizer that heats up the cannabis you inhale the vapor and that avoids pyrolysis that involves smoke which is really bad for your lungs so the important thing to know is if you go to a cbd only product there'll be no intoxication but if you go to higher doses of thc containing products then you get intoxication with higher doses and that's an issue that can be managed but if you've never been intoxicated with thc before then you may find it quite unusual and it's better to titrate upwards if you're starting a thc product start from a very low goals and build up gradually over time there's a lot of good resources for you to learn more about medicinal cannabis recently the national prescribing service uh opened an excellent website uh nps for orgone eu which explains medicinal cannabis and how to access it very well both for consumers and also for doctors as well so that's an excellent resource there the tga itself also has very good consumer information so there's no real reason for you to be left in the dark about this area if you know where to look i'll also give a paper that came out last week that comes from our group which is a kind of simple how-to guide for prescribing medicinal cannabis and has a lot of the key information in the four or five page simple to understand document and that's a free download from australian prescriber so does medicinal cannabis work and and what are the side effects what what can you expect well let's have a look at thc first as i've mentioned it's the main intoxicating compound in cannabis so if you take a high dose of thc you get quite stoned and we know that's through an action of what's called cd1 cannabinoid receptors part of the endocannabinoid system when thc hits that receptor then that causes intoxication but lower doses of thc are thought to have therapeutic properties at levels that may not actually intoxicate you so it's important to divorce the loados and high dose effects thc has actually been available for decades as a drug called granabinol and it's been prescribed in countries other than australia for for quite a long time and the sort of things it's useful for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting as richard mentioned a lot of cancer patients get very sick when they're given chemotherapy and throw up and feel nauseous and thc has a good effect on that anorexia during palliative care and also with hiv aids there's evidence for that chronic pain and also spasticity and multiple sclerosis and there's a whole lot of interesting emerging indications as well we're starting to get an indication that thc may have some value in dementia and also tourette's syndrome and also in insomnia as well and here's a study that we were involved in with some oncologists at the lifehouse center in sydney and it verified the value of thc cbd containing capsules for people that had chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting that wasn't being helped by standard treatment so refractory cinv and this proves the point i think that cannabinoids can move in when conventional medications fail and produce a useful therapeutic effect there's also some good evidence from other uh trials of ms spasticity in fact this spray called sativex which contains thc and cbd has been used for many years for spasticity in multiple sclerosis the painful muscular spasms that people with ms experience and this is the only cannabinoid product that's currently registered in australia uh sanivex we've got a trial underway in queensland for tourette's syndrome for people that have uncontrollable ticks and we're starting to get an interesting signal from this trial that one of the conditions is placebo control so we don't know which one but one of them seems to be causing quite a remarkable reduction in tanks so we'll know the final answer to that question at the end of the year that that involves thc as well there's also some remarkable data from israel this is a very large um study of almost three thousand i think cancer patients with advanced cancer looking at what happens when they take a cannabis product for six months uh this is cannabis plant material and you if you look at the pain intensity rating at the beginning of the study before treatment there's 253 patients that rate their pain intensity as 10 129 at 9 23 at 8. so these are people really severe pain and after six months on cannabis you can see that very few patients had pain ratings that high and there was also remarkable improvements in quality of life in the study the tga has summarized the evidence themselves around medicinal cannabis and its then treated chronic non-cancer pain and they were quite cautious in a way but they did conclude and i'm sorry for this very busy table but if you focus just on the punchline down the bottom of the slide they concluded that the overall evidence is not very good and there's not that many robust clinical trials we're always looking for very good quality clinical trial evidence and unfortunately with cannabis the quality has not been that good historically it's been quite difficult to do clinical trials with cannabinoids but despite that they still concluded that there was moderate evidence that cannabinoids were effective in providing as much as a 50 percent reduction in pain so that's that's the tga the side effects to look out for well always good as i said earlier to titrate your cb your thc doses upwards gradually to avoid these side effects the higher doses can cause dizziness confusion cognitive impairment and some anxiety and paranoia in vulnerable individuals and if you have a family history of mental health problems particularly schizophrenia you'd probably best avoid at least higher doses of thc whether there are side effects or beneficial effects you may know appetite stimulation of thc and unusually good humor i'm not sure if that's a side effect or not and some people that have used thc for a long long time get a mild withdrawal syndrome when they come off it but it's nothing like the withdrawal that you see with opioids or with benzodiazepines there is an issue with driving a thc can cause a modest short lasting driving impairment and a slightly increased risk of a crash at very high doses t of thc this is sort of equivalent to low doses of alcohol but not higher doses of alcohol and in regular cannabis users we actually see substantially less driving impairment and in some measures of driving thc actually appears to reduce risk drivers appear to compensate for the presence of thc drive more slowly and leave a larger distance between them and the car in front and overall the risk with cannabis appears less than prescription medications where driving is actually legal so benzodiazepines opioids said drugs anti-histamines all impaired driving but there's no roadside broad testing for these substances with cbd there doesn't appear to be any driving impairment and i think we need to tweak the legislation in australia to better reflect actual risk that cannabis poses of course if you're on a thc product then you have no exemption from roadside drug testing so it's good to be aware that if you're taking a thc medication recently and you're probably vulnerable to giving a positive roadside drug test for at least six hours afterwards and we've done quite a lot of work on that and shown that the current roadside drug testing technologies are actually quite unreliable so some unlucky people may still give a positive test 24 hours later even when there's very little thc in their saliva while other people even 10 minutes after they've taken thc will give a negative test so the roadside testing technology is really not very good at all but you do run a risk under current legislation of being criminalized for driving under the influence of thc and we know this is a substantial disincentive for people joining our clinical trials where there's thc medications involved okay let me just tell you a little bit now about cbd it's the non-intoxicating cannabinoid it has a whole bunch of neurochemical actions that are very interesting but it doesn't hit the cb1 cannabinoid receptor like thcs so it doesn't get you intoxicated the way that thc does it seems to increase concentrations of endocannabinoids in the brain and the body and it has strong anti-inflammatory effects in a lot of the cellular models and animal models that we look at and recently the tga approved a cbd product called epidialex for pediatric epilepsy and this is very similar to what caitlin lambert was given illegally back in 2015 by her father she was obviously way ahead of her time and that that medication is now an approved medication five years later has taken all this time for the regulators to catch up and there's a whole load of very interesting and merging indications for cbd and uh as a new york times uh magazine said recently can cbd really do all that there's a huge amount of height that cbd is like a universal panacea and can relieve everything from depression to arthritis to diabetes to cancer to brain injury and we certainly need more signs to work through these um these claims and as with thc and cannabis in general there's generally a lack of high quality research and say with musculoskeletal diseases a recent review said that basically there's not anything other than anecdotal accounts and retrospective reviews so we desperately need to do high quality clinical trials of cbd in the pain arena this is it's already the case that many australian patients are using cbd for pain so if we go back to this slide the s4 category of medications in australia the medicinal cannabis products are cbd products so you can see from this graph but a lot of chronic pain patients and cancer pain and neuropathic pain patients are using cbd dominant products we just don't have any clinical trial evidence that they weren't but i assume that if people are using these products then they must do something useful one thing that we recently gathered evidence for with cbd was anxiety and we showed in a clinical trial in melbourne with the origin group the 12 weeks of treatment with cbd at quite high doses had quite a remarkable effect on young people with anxiety disorders and again these were sort of the the really hard cases these were young people who hadn't benefited from seeing a psychologist or from anti-depressant medication and we treated them in this clinical trial with um escalating doses of cbd and capsules over 12 weeks from 200 milligrams up to 800 milligrams i've really got quite a remarkable effect a highly significant reduction in their anxiety and impairment at week 12 or on two different measures of anxiety and also reduction in depressive symptomatology depression and anxiety often go hand in hand and their overall occupational functioning and social functioning their ability to get out the house and to make their way in in the outside world was greatly improved so there's a lot of a lot of promise there with higher doses of cbd in intractable anxiety and we need more and larger clinical trials to cement this effect in many countries around the world you can just walk into a health food store or a pharmacy and get cbd over the counter this is a shot i think in chicago the two of us cbd topical uh which is claiming to have some anti-pain effects you can even get cbd in your ice cream it's all become a little bit crazy in some ways in the usa the range of cbd products that are available and there's a lot of hype about lodo's cbd and sports we've got bubba watson there the top golfers swearing by the use of cbd it helps with his body and helps with his anxiety and i think most of the rugby players in the uk at the moment are on cbd to help them with recovery from matches and and cbd is widely available over the counter in the uk in fact this is me in my hometown of edinburgh walking into uh honda barrett in princess street to get hold of some five percent cbd i use it for tennis actually it seems to improve my very lousy game the thing about the over the cancer products is that they're very low doses so typically 10 to 100 milligrams of cbd whereas when we get to treating epilepsy or severe anxiety we're dealing with losses of 300 to 1500 milligrams so there's a real question mark around the evidence base for these logos cbd products interestingly in australia the tga has come out with an interim decision which may allow these logos cbd products to become over-the-counter medications in australia during 2021 but they're only allowing a recommended daily dose of up to 60 milligrams so while this is a really welcome development in terms of improving patient access to cbd there's a lot of uncertainty over whether these very low doses do anything in particular and uh some evidence has come recently from new zealand and in a study of uh patients who are prescribed cbd uh there was an encouraging signal with things like pain and discomfort and people who had lung cancer pain but also anxiety and depression so we certainly need better evidence that the evidence is starting to accumulate that needs to be consolidated and one of the key trials that we'll run at the lambert initiative next year is to look at low-dose cbd in adults older adults who have multi-moderate insomnia and we'll give half of them placebo and half of them are a low dose of cbd over 12 weeks escalating from 20 up to 60 milligrams and we'll hope to have a positive effect on their insomnia but also on anxiety pain moods cognitive function and quality of life so this is really a flagship study for us and moving forward another really important study i mentioned earlier people who suffer spinal injuries have to deal with the devastation of what that causes but to add further cruelty and about half of them experience chronic neuropathic pain as a result of their injury and we have a theory about what's going on in the brain with these patients and we have a theory that cbd may be able to turn down the pain signal and we're going to run a clinical trial and combine that with brain imaging and this is luke henderson sasha and sherry and elizabeth cairns from the lambert initiative they're going to run this trial and this could be a real major breakthrough in terms of cbd's use and intractable chronic pain some final thoughts just to close out my lecture and we have maybe 30 000 patients getting official cannabis by the end of this year that's great but the australian government's own figures from the australian institute of health and welfare suggest that 600 000 australians are currently using medicinal cannabis so 570 000 are probably using illegal products and richard referred to this gap between the legal scheme and what's actually happening on the ground and we published a paper recently where we surveyed 40 nearly 1400 australians that were using medicinal cannabis and found that only one in 30 of them were actually accessing their cannabis legally so that's a huge number of people that are continuing with illicit cannabis to treat their medical conditions and who suffer the risk of being criminalized if they fall into the criminal justice system and when we look to the conditions that these people were self-medicating with what's it cannabis for pain was 37.5 of the total of uh main conditions cited for use of cannabis and back pain was particularly prevalent prevalence as well as arthritis nerve pain and fibromyalgia and also a lot of mental health conditions that were being self-medicated as well so we still have a long way to go in terms of bridging that gap between the official scheme and illicit use one reason for encouragement is australia has a lot of clinical trials around medicinal cannabis when we last counted there was more than 60 and we're probably one of the best countries in the world for doing clinical trials for medicinal cannabis we have a great health system and we have access to um i guess reasonably reasonably good quality products for these trials another final point which i think is a very important one is that we've seen worldwide the huge problems with prescription opioids and richard referred to this in his talk and particularly the mortality with you know 60 or 70 000 deaths in the u.s last year mostly from fentanyl and oxycodone and heroin overdoses and an interesting thing that seems to happen when medicinal cannabis becomes legal in various u.s states there's 25 percent reduction in opioids overdose mortality according to the studies so when cannabis becomes available people use less prescription opioids and other studies suggest people use less lyrica and gabapentinoid type drugs and also benzodiazepines so that in itself is probably a good reason to improve access because medicinal cannabis i think is a lot less harmful certainly than the opioids and the benzodiazepines we at the lambert initiative will continue to try and build a better cannabis and in our research where we've got some of these plant components that aren't thc or cbd that look very exciting we have one called cbc that has very strong anti-anxiety effects cbg seems to be showing quite remarkable effects against inflammation cbga is an anti-convulsant and we're also working on a range of new molecules that seem to just give the endocannabinoid system a big boost and by doing that they've reduced pain anxiety and depression so it's a very very exciting time to be involved in this field and thank you so much for the opportunity to give this lecture well well thank thank you ian for uh such a comprehensive presentation that really sort of walked us through so many aspects to do with medicinal cannabis so um so that was really fantastic it certainly increased my understanding quite a lot and i i'm sure it did with many members of the audience um richard maybe a question for you to start with someone has asked whether it's possible to confirm if medicinal cannabis is an item that could be purchased with home care package funds or is that something uh that is probably quite particular right it's it's quite a specific question i guess yeah i i i doubt it i think unfortunately the access pathways as we've described and it's very hard to see how um the government would permit the use of those funds to access um medication like this so i think that's unlikely doesn't mean it's the right decision i think ultimately what we really are aiming for is to have a product that you know all products the many many different products but to have a range of products that are affordable and one of the other recommendations in the uh senate inquiry was that if we can't if we don't achieve that through just um having uh more products come online and cost come down then ultimately uh we need to set up some sort of subsidy scheme and um and that would be you know that's that's something that the committee recommended but i suspect particularly at the moment the government's not particularly keen to to come out thanks richard um and ian a question for you the use of medicinal cannabis as a sort of a complementary medicine to other forms someone mentions about taking medicinal cannabis alongside chemotherapy what are your comments in relation to that in a sort of a complementary sense well i think the evidence is fairly good now that um you can get relief from some of the adverse symptoms of chemotherapy with um particularly thc but cbd may also have a wall as well and we've certainly shown up with nausea and vomiting but a lot of people actually develop neuropathic pain neuropathy as a result of chemotherapy particularly drugs like that and um depending on animal models it seems the prevention of that kind of neuropathy with cannabinoids as well so it's certainly worth considering and and i think that recent study from people grimacing was just published last month may reverberate around the world actually in terms of clinical practice and that is the hope that you know we're doing these clinical trials to try and change the way that doctors behave and to give patients a better chance of a therapeutic response particularly in you know areas like cancer where there can be quite extreme suffering the in sorry richard a question for you um just someone's commenting it's strange that medicinal cannabis is controlled by the poison standard in australia well um the i think ian touched on it the there's a very long history around the use of cannabis uh in any setting and um that has been responsible for really holding back a lot of the um developments that we've we're now starting to see is the drugs officially illegal and uh that made that made it very difficult and that's by not by um dint of uh just australian law that's an international convention on the use of drugs uh effectively prohibited the use of cannabis now um that's changed recently but it's it is one of the reasons why we you know we're only starting now to see you know the the field flourish and the i think potential of the very many different preparations starting to be explored now ian could probably talk about the many obstacles i suspect they've had to confront over their uh years in this field sorry i used to joke that uh be easier to you know land a chimp on the moon than to run a clinical trial with with this whole cannabis and that's that's what it was like uh certainly in the early days that there was no familiarity around clinical trial ethics and governance for these products that's one of the reasons that our flagship driving study we did in the netherlands because we could actually give people cannabis products and allow them to drive on on real roads and so i think it'd be fair to say that as of 2019 2020 there's a lot better understanding around clinical trial governance and in fact talking to overseas companies they sort of hold australia up as a great destination to do their clinical trials so so that that's been a bit of a change and i think one of the key things is actually to differentiate cbd and thc is as soon as governance and ethics and doctors understand that difference and you're running a cbd trial everything becomes much much easier um there's still issues with thc and particularly recruiting patients when we tell them that they're on a thc product and they can't drive for 12 weeks for the duration of the trial that's terribly difficult and we probably lose about 50 of our potential recruits for trials as a result of that single item and and then um a question regarding the efficacy of edible versus vaporized medicinal cannabis it's a very good question i have some colleagues who work in pain meds and who say that vaporized is good for breakthrough pain because it's fairly instantaneous so you know you'll feel the effects within two or three minutes so um whereas oral you have a very different what we call pharmacokinetics so how quickly the drug comes on and how quickly it disappears so with oral products you probably are waiting a couple of hours before you get the peak you may feel them within half an hour or so so you get a kind of longer more sustained therapeutic effect with your products but if you have something that he's dealt with very rapidly for example breakthrough pain then vaporized might be best and richard um a question regarding does does each doctor have to apply to the tga to access medical cannabis for prescription or does the tga issue one permit for all prescribers no so um i should have said this in my talk you can become an authorized prescriber that is also another pathway however that is notoriously difficult and there are very few authorized prescribers in australia and they're for a very narrow set of conditions i think largely for pediatric epilepsy maybe almost exclusively neurologists so you can't become an authorized prescriber easily it's as i said almost impossible and uh to my knowledge there aren't there may be one or two gps but certainly not more than that in the country um the other pathway requires you to apply individually for each patient and what's worse is at least at the time of the senate inquiry is that your approval was valid only for a specific preparation and so if you wanted to try something else or now the cheese you have said they were looking at it at the time but look it was very difficult you had to basically justify you you would get approval for that patient for that preparation uh and um unfortunately anybody else you you had you have to go through the same the same process it's it's fair to say that the process has become more streamlined it was very difficult in the early days but even so if you're a gp and you're sitting there and you might have you know if you're lucky your gp spends a bit of time with you but the difference between seeing a few extra patients each day is either write the script for the drug that you can get very quickly or spend a few minutes um and it can be five minutes ten minutes uh going through this process and and in some ways having your i suppose clinical judgment questioned by the tga um gps just don't like doing that that's a that's a barrier and so i think that i touched on this earlier i think that one pathway through this is similar to what we've done with other drugs is that trying to build uh an authorized prescriber pathway for gps who can demonstrate they've done some basic training they're up to date with the literature they basically are now um have have some knowledge and expertise in the field and they're now authorized prescribers and they can basically prescribe this in the same way prescribe other medicines that's the way to fix it i think thanks for that richard um ian a question um is there any concern in prescribing uh medicinal cannabis for people with cognitive decline could could it um confuse uh increase confusion in any way it's a very interesting question and very valid question as well with um cbd we know that it has quite strong neuroprotective effects so certainly in animal models it seems to reverse some of the neural degeneration that you get there's some very good australian research actually with um animal models of alzheimer's disease where cbd's had quite remarkable effect in restoring cognitive function we're yet to see that in human clinical trials yet but it's an interesting signal um another thing that is interesting with thc is again in animal models i mean we know that thc tends to impair cognition particularly in young people but uh in animal models of dementia it seems to restore cognition which is quite incredible uh there's also a signal coming from western australia a small study that was done for when you give thc to patients with agitation and dementia and we've all seen with the royal commission into nursing homes the the the the chemical restraint and and the the royal commission into disability as well the issue of restraint with antipsychotic drugs and benzodiazepines a major one and what we're starting to see in very small studies is if you give thc and cbd together in agitated patients then there may actually be a a beneficial effect in terms of reducing agitation that's one of the trials that we hope to run a large trial on in the next couple of years because it's such a major issue for for nursing homes and people in the in in elderly care richard um someone's asked about uh how would you find out find a rheumatologist that might consider the prescription of medicinal cannabis should it be appropriate is it is it a matter of uh just raising it with your rheumatologist and um and uh you know finding a rheumatologist i guess there's no particular list around a specialist would there be no it's a good question and unfortunately we you know a lot of this is word of mouth i think ian mentioned this these new cannabis clinics but it's you know it's a few hundred bucks three or four hundred bucks just for a console um and so most people just don't you know why should they have to pay that i mean to access what could be a you know very effective therapy so um beyond that it really is word of mouth and i as far as i'm aware i don't know that there's any publicly accessible information on uh doctors who have expertise in this field uh as is always the case whenever you've got something like this there are always people also um who seek to make a quick buck out of it as well and so you've got to be careful uh that who you're talking to is reputable um i think most you know most gps would absolutely who are keen to prescribe it will will have done their homework but unfortunately unless ian's got any other suggestions uh it's largely word of mouth um and asking your gp if they if they don't can they recommend somebody who does ask this as your rheumatologist if they don't uh ask somebody who does uh and if they're not health um find someone who is i think i think that is probably would that be your opinion ian that it is pretty much word of mouth it is i mean there's you can go to the access clinics and they probably know which specialists are savvy in this area but as richard said you're probably up for 300 or 400 dollars to get that information um i i know a very good rheumatologist but i will mention his name in this forum but we're doing some research with him at the moment and getting some extraordinary effects in models of arthritis that we want to take into uh so they do exist and you may have to shop around and maybe if you have a conversation with your rheumatologist they might be able to refer you onto someone i mean i i think it's changed a lot in the last three or four years with doctors i think they're much more savvy about this area and we still particularly in some specializations have a lot of skepticism you know we did a survey recently of gastroenterologists and only 20 of them wanted to prescribe as as of 2020 so that was a little bit disappointing but in psychiatry and neurology and maybe maybe in pain medicine to a certain extent as well we're getting more positive responses from from pain medicine specialists and addiction medicine as well we're starting to see this tide of change and i think maybe doctors and specialists fear they may be left behind if they don't at least learn about this they don't necessarily have to embrace it wholeheartedly but the more patients ask them about it the more they'll be forced to upskill in this area which is tremendously important for them to do that that's that's very true um in just a very important point and richard just sort of raised this in his last comments uh the difference between medicinal cannabis and the cannabis that the the local dealer might grow in their backyard i think that importance of actually getting good quality product um you know what what should the sort of the average community member who's interested in medicinal cannabis or finding out about it what what they should what should they be wary of in relation to this particular issue i'll go to you first in well one of the most fun studies i've ever been involved in we had the new south wales police bring us i think more than 250 bags of weed that they confiscated from i think mostly the byron bay music festival but a variety of other locations um and we analyzed the street cannabis it actually came from all around new south wales and what we found was that there was only five or six samples that actually had any cbd in them so the problem i think is that street cannabis and i'd love to repeat that study just to prove that nothing's changed but overwhelmingly i think street cannabis tends to be thc dominant so you're unlikely to get cbd and unless you can find a source and these sources do exist with people who have more of a medical um flavor to to their illegal supply and there are people that do that and but yeah the the problem with getting an illicit supply is probably that you're going to get very high thc cannabis with no cbd so you'll miss the benefits that cbd can offer but there's also issues with you know was a pesticide or a fungicide used in the growth of that cannabis um if it's an oil where solvent you know sometimes butane is used lighter fuel is used to extract cannabinoids now i don't want to scare monitor but but you know if you don't know the provenance of your cannabis product then you do run that risk and that's why we need a much better official scheme uh in australia so that people can benefit from quality assurance or around official products um richard did you have a last comment in relation to that issue what would you advise you know patients that you may have seen yes um i think alien's right just on the seat on the thc cbd issue just it's important to sort of spell out that the cbd and the reason that's in like quantities in street cannabis is that modulates against the effects of the thc so the thc makes you high the cbd in some ways prevents some of the action that action and therefore most of the stuff you get on the street is very low in cbd so that people can experience the euphoria and there's nc lose some of those benefits the other thing that's interesting is as ian said there are people who specifically supply medicinal cannabis products illicitly but even where that market's been tested there's huge variation in terms of what people are getting in terms of the quantities of cbd and indeed in some there were some operations that had almost none undetectable levels so if you're getting your medicinal cannabis product illicitly you may be getting a decent product but you may be getting something that as ian said is potentially dangerous but huge variation in terms of what's available so really the only way to be sure is to get something uh through a regulated market and that's where my interest here is to try and put some quality control have a regulated market gives doctors confidence no you know in terms of knowing obviously what they're prescribing and people confidence in knowing uh what they're getting so it comes back to that question of trying to find a gp who can prescribe you a product uh which has gone through a rigorous quality control process otherwise you just don't know what you're getting that's right that's right look that's uh we've reached the sort of the end of our um we've hit our finishing time now and i'm very aware of not keeping our presenters uh much longer and there have been some unanswered questions but we certainly uh i think ian and richard were very generous in trying to get through as many questions as they could listen i would like to thank you both because i think tonight's been fantastic to just give a improve people's understanding around medicinal cannabis some of the issues uh in the research area also at the sort of political and legislative area so it's been really fantastic to just have this discussion and put it out there for the community and hopefully increases increase under people people's understanding and knowledge around the current situation in australia so ian richard i'd like to on behalf of musculoskeletal australia thank you both very much for your generous uh time and skills and expertise that you've shared with us tonight i'd like to thank everyone for joining us as well uh there were some fantastic sites within uh ian's presentation with regards to where you can see further information we have information on our musculoskeletal australia website as well about medicinal cannabis and also you could always ring our helpline on 1-800-263-265 if there are some other questions that you have or your question wasn't answered tonight so look on that note i wish everyone a very good evening thanks so much for joining us and thanks again to ian and richard and good night everyone
4-DMw6tpa7g,SME Assist - Meeting Your Obligations – Supplying medicinal cannabis in Australia,2022-02-02T01:06:33Z,so my name is stephen smith fleury i work at the sme assist uh in the sme assist team here at the therapeutic goods administration uh just before we do start today i'd like to acknowledge the traditional owners and custodians of the lands on which we meet today and pay my respects to their elders past present and emerging i'd also like to extend that respect and acknowledgement to any aboriginal and torres strait islander peoples joining us today so just a disclaimer before we do start so uh please just note that these slides are a summary only and that they shouldn't be taken as laurel policy so today's training session uh will consist of a few different parts so part one will cover the basics of therapeutic goods regulation uh so this will provide an overview on how therapeutic goods are regulated uh what we do at the tga and we'll cover some terms that you'll need to know and also where to find help if you need it part two we'll cover supplying medicinal cannabis so this is where we'll look at that sort of specialized part of today's workshop we'll cover suppliers of prescription and over the counter medicine and we'll also hear about both the tga and office of drug controls requirements on manufacturing and importing from there we'll have a short break and then we'll be back for part three which is a q a session with tga experts and we'll spend an hour in that q a so as i said we will start with the basics of therapeutic goods regulation uh where i'll give you general information about uh the therapeutic goods regulation in australia uh the role of the tga tga's sme assist service and how to supply medicinal cannabis in australia also point you in the direction of where you can find some help if you do need it so we do understand that therapeutic goods regulation can be challenging to navigate we provide the sme assist service at the tga to help small and medium enterprises startups researchers and anybody basically who's unfamiliar with therapeutic goods regulation to understand their responsibilities when it comes to supplying therapeutic goods so our team runs workshops which cover the basics of regulation market authorization manufacturing advertising and post market monitoring so we do have recorded uh we have recorded sorry and published some of our live streams workshops and also have pre-recorded material available for you so you can find all of this on the tga website under educational videos or on the sme assist hub of the tga website too we do have a range of interactive decision tools to help with decision making when it comes to supplying therapeutic goods uh so these includes is my product a therapeutic good so um just as a as it sounds that decision tool will help you determine whether or not your product is a therapeutic good or not uh and another uh tool that we do have available amongst others is what classification is my medical device in case you're looking at supplying a device so we do encourage you to subscribe to our sme assist email list to stay up to date with the latest sma information including any upcoming workshops new guidance and webinars i will mention here also that we have recently released a series of five podcasts just around a therapeutic goods regulation we cover things like what happens in the laboratories advertising of therapeutic goods and manufacturing amongst other things so you can find that podcast wherever you listen to your podcast it's available on all platforms now also on the tga website so we'll start now with the basics of therapeutic goods regulation so first we'll have a look at the tga of course who we are and what we do so we are a part of the australian government department of health we regulate and monitor all therapeutic goods to ensure that they're safe of good quality and do what they're supposed to do we do this in line with the therapeutic goods act which provides a uniform national system of controls over therapeutic goods and and this system of course is a benefit to both consumers and industry uh now when we're looking at what are therapeutic goods uh what a therapeutic good is sorry uh what do we mean by therapeutic good uh so a therapeutic good is broadly defined as something that's used for preventing diagnosing curing or alleviating a disease ailment defect or injury so for example a medicine like paracetamol a therapeutic good may influence inhibit or modify physio physiology so for example a pacemaker it could be used to test for a disease or ailment so something like an mri machine potentially it can influence control or prevent conception for example a condom it can test for pregnancy so pregnancy test it could also replace or modify a part of the anatomy so for example a prosthesis again we do have those decision tools available on our sme assist webpage to help you determine if your product is a therapeutic good and again in the case of a device the classification that it might be so therapeutic goods generally fall under three categories uh we're looking at medicines biologicals uh and of course medical devices uh first we'll have a look at uh medicines so within that space we've got prescription medicines like antibiotics and these require a doctor's prescription we've got complementary medicines which contain herbs vitamins minerals nutritional supplements homeopathic and certain aromatherapy preparations so for example here we might be looking at multivitamins some herbal teas and also potentially some essential oils and then we've also got over-the-counter medicines so these can be purchased without a prescription and they're also not considered complementary medicine so they include things like some lozenges and also some cold and flu tablets so medicines uh also include things like vaccines blood and plasma the second category category we'll have a look here are biologicals which are things that are made from or contain human cell human cells or tissues or live animal cells tissues or organs an example might be a skin graft between patients and finally we have medical devices so they have a physical or mechanical effect on the body and are used to measure or monitor bodily functions so they can include things like surgical tools appliances like pacemakers and materials like sterile bandages so it's also important to know what the tga doesn't regulate so we don't regulate veterinary medicines we don't regulate health professionals or health insurance we don't regulate food standards and we don't regulate cosmetic and chemical standards so these are regulated by other federal or state state and territory bodies uh you can see some of those here on this slide um do note that some cosmetics used in surgery so for example things like breast implants and cosmetic injectables are actually regulated by the tga and it's also worth noting as we do sometimes interact with other regulators so if you do work with us you may also need to work with other other regulators so at the tga we also we don't research or develop new therapeutic goods we don't provide clinical advice to individuals or consider cost-effectiveness or recommend one product over another and we don't make decisions about subsidies of therapeutic goods here we have an overview of the therapeutic development life development life cycle sorry to show you how the different stages do fit together so first if you're looking at conducting a clinical trial you'd design and get approval to run that trial then you'd use you'd get approval to use your unapproved product in the trial and then you'd also seek approval to supply your product after that so that's known as market authorization um and then after that during that you'd also potentially look at possible subsidization of your product so here you can see that the tga is responsible for the use of your unapproved product in a clinical trial and approving the supply of your product so you can see that in the blue boxes here tga isn't responsible for designing clinical trials or subsidising therapeutic goods so you can see those things in the green boxes here and i'll just note that subsidization is carried out by our colleagues over at the broader department of health for some products you may be able to make applications to the department for subsidy in parallel with your application to the tga for market authorisation however no pharmaceutical prosthesis or medicare listing will occur until the product is actually included on the australian register of therapeutic goods or artg so for more information around this you can contact the pharmaceutical benefits scheme or have a look at their website you can also check the prosthesis list advisory committee website or the medical services advisory committee website and and do remember that tga approval doesn't necessarily mean that your product will be subsidized now we might just move on now and have a bit more of a look a closer look at clinical trials uh and our involvement there so in australia the clinical trial environment is quite broad clinical trials conducted here are subject to various regulatory controls to ensure the safety of participants all clinical trials require ethics approval before they can commence and trials that do involve the use of unapproved therapeutic goods are also subject to tga requirements while the tga is not heavily involved in clinical trials are two pathways for accessing unapproved therapeutic goods for experimental purposes uh first of all the notification process called the ctn scheme and this is for lower risk products and then for some high risk or novel treatment such as gene therapy we've got the approval process which is called the cta scheme uh the use of unapproved therapeutic goods in a clinical trial must be in accordance with national and international guidelines and of course the protocol approved by the relevant human research ethics committee so our australian clinical trial handbook provides guidance on requirements when conducting clinical trials using unapproved therapeutic goods so it does help those involved to understand their roles and responsibilities under our legislation and you can see more information on the responsibilities outside of tga requirements if you visit the national health and medical research council australian clinical trials website so for any further information or clarification on our australian clinical trial handbook you can always get in touch with us via telephone or email of course so we'll move on now to market authorisation so market authorization is required of course before you can supply a therapeutic good in australia uh when we look at supply we're not just looking at selling a product so supply is the sale exchange gift lease loan higher or higher purchase of the product so we're looking at things here like potentially a free sample the leasing of a dentist drill hiring out crutches all of those things and all of those activities would need market authorization now if you want to manufacture import export or arrange for the import export or manufacture of therapeutic goods you will need to apply for market authorization when authorisation is granted the products would be added to the australian register of therapeutic goods or artg so i've mentioned this a couple of times already the aitg is an online database on the tga website where you can search using keywords so you could potentially search for a product name and active ingredients a sponsor name as well there's a number of search terms that you can use it is a good idea if you are applying for market authorization that you do search the artg to see similar products that are being supplied now each artg entry is unique in some way or as we call it separate and distinct so this uniqueness depends on the type of therapeutic good you have you can see here and you will have received the slides for today you can go to the relevant links here and have a look at the definition in the legislation that's relevant to your product for now we'll just have a look at a high risk prescription medicine as an example so if we have another medicine that is exactly the same but has a different name a different indication or different dosage that product would be considered separate and distinct and it'll have its own artg entry in that case but if it has just a different pack size first pack size sorry for instance so for example 12 a 12 pack of tablets versus a 36 pack of tablets it's not considered a separate and distinct uh and a separate artg entry uh would not be required in that case okay so when we are assessing your product for market authorization approval we do use a benefit versus risk approach so goods that do pose a higher risk of adverse events or are used for more serious diseases like prescription medicines are more tightly regulated than those that pose a lower risk like herbal supplements each therapeutic good will have different degrees of benefit and risk but in all cases benefits must outrage outweigh the risks so we'll have a look at benefit versus risk in the context of medicines here so as you can see medicines are considered low or high risk depending on the claims made about the medicine what it contains the benefits and risks associated with it in australia lower risk and high risk medicines are given particular names so lower risk medicines are called listed medicines higher risk medicines are called registered medicines and anything in between those are called assessed listed medicines so the take home message here i guess is that higher risk registered medicines do require more rigorous pre-market evaluation now our work at the tga is ongoing it does continue over the lifetime of every therapeutic good from manufacturing through to adverse events our regulatory compliance functions do support consumer protection and enable a fair market for industry we monitor and enforce where necessary compliance with legislation regulations and rules for therapeutic goods we do promote high levels of voluntary compliance through engagement and education as well now all types of therapeutic goods do have their own australian regulatory guidelines to assist applicants and sponsors with the process of applying for market authorisation so these are listed on the slide here as you can see do note that they are guidance documents only but you can access them through the links shown on the slides if you do access them and need any help with them if you i'm not sure what something means in there you're more than welcome to give us a call here or of course pop us an email so the australian regulatory guidelines are located in the industry tab on the tga website the different types of therapeutic goods are listed underneath as you can see here you select the standards and guidelines and then you'll find the relevant guidelines for the type of products that you're looking at supplying so you can see there we've got prescription medicines over-the-counter medicines complementary medicines as well as sunscreens medical devices and so on now the tga business services is where you'll submit and manage your applications so every sponsor does need an account for the tga business services portal and you would create an account by completing an organization details form which you can find on the tga website you complete that form and send it back to the email address on the form itself if you do need any help with it at all again please don't hesitate to get in touch with us here so fees and charges we do cover costs through fees and charges for activities that fall within the scope of the therapeutic goods act so as a sponsor of a therapeutic good you will be required to pay fees and charges that apply to your good fees are for a service while charges of course are an annual tax all therapeutic goods on the artg are subject to annual charges except for export-only products and products that fall under the annual charge exemption scheme so we do encourage you to have a look at the link to fees and charges so that you do know what to expect now i did mention the annual charge exemption or a scheme so this allows for the exemption of annual charges until a product first generates turnover so all new entries on the artg are eligible and sponsors would need to make a declaration each year confirming zero dollars turnover so we do know that fees are not included in the annual charge exemption scheme only charges and i will just note here also um if you do have a product that doesn't make turnover in the first couple of years and then it does you'd no longer be eligible for the ace scheme even if in the future it doesn't generate so the sme assist hub so you can find a range of information on the sme assist hub under the industry section of the tga website so as you can see here you can click on that section on the front page there you can also go to the industry tab uh of the tga website and you'll see sme assist at the top of the page then okay so we'll now take you through some of the aspects of supplying medicinal cannabis in australia so please do note that we will briefly cover uh access to unapproved medicinal cannabis products but our focus will be on domestic supply of products included in the artg and the pathways through which this can be done as we've already learned all therapeutic goods unless exempt or excluded must be included in the australian register of therapeutic goods before import into export from or supply in australia so this includes medicinal cannabis products when for general supply in the marketplace there are also particular circumstances in which approval is granted for the use of unapproved products and we'll touch on that now so medicines that are not included on the artg are known as unapproved medicines now with these products it is really important to note that the tga has not evaluated them for safety or efficacy now as far as accessing these goods any australian medical practitioner can apply to supply these products via the special access scheme or sas or the authorized prescriber scheme so the authorized prescriber uh scheme under that scheme medical practitioners can apply uh to supply a specific unapproved medicinal cannabis product uh to specific patients with patients with a particular medicinal conditional symptom as far as the special access scheme medical professionals can apply to prescribe these products for any um particular indication so as far as actually making application health professionals would lodge their special access scheme application or authorized prescriber scheme application through the online sas or authorized prescriber online system now they may need to also make application to relevant state or territory health departments but we do have an arrangement in place with the online portal now where we can submit those in tandem so anyone supplying medicinal cannabis through these schemes so what would be known as a sponsor is responsible for meeting their regulatory requirements now this would include the submission of the tgo 93 declaration form so the therapeutic goods order 93 or tgo93 is a standard that specifies minimum quality requirements for medicinal cannabis products so that would need to be submitted to the tga so more information about these process processes is available on the tga website or you can contact contact us by telephone or email again the government's ultimate goal is to have a wider range of medicinal cannabis products included in the artg as registered medicines so we're now going to move on to general supply of medicinal cannabis for those products requiring inclusion on the artg so first of all our first stop of course is to look at the scheduling products uh so scheduling of medicines plays an important role when supplying medicinal cannabis the poison standard has been developed to ensure the safe handling of substances in australia it does provide a uniform approach to control the availability and accessibility of substances that can be used as ingredients in medicines as well as cosmetics agricultural products or household cleaners so it also includes provisions about containers and labels with a view to promoting uniform labeling and packaging requirements through australia so the poison standard is given legal effect through state and territory legislation it's also known as the standard for uniform scheduling of medicines and poisons or s-u-s-m-p so um yeah as i said the different states and territories may give that different legal effect and it's always good to check with them also so medicines and poisons are classified into schedules as shown here on the slide so for our purposes we're looking at schedule three which is uh for pharmacists only medicine schedule four is prescription-only medicine and schedule 8 is for controlled drugs so you can find more information about scheduling on the tga website and we do have a link in the slides today again you can contact us if you need assistance so if we look at cannabis and cannabis scheduling it does a cannabis and its derivatives do appear in schedules 3 4 8 and 9 of the poison standard so for our purposes today though we'll be looking at uh schedules three four and eight uh as schedule nine substances uh cannot be used in therapeutic goods uh so the first things that we'll look at here are cannabis and tetrahydrocannabinol or thc so as you can see from the slide here under certain circumstances cannabis and thc are controlled drugs uh and appear under schedule eight of the poison standard uh when prepared or packed for human therapeutic use so access will need to be confirmed uh with relevant state and territories as this can vary between jurisdictions so the next uh substance that we'll have a look at here is cannabidiol or cbd so cannabidiol or cbd can appear in schedules four or three so for the schedule 4 entry it is in preparations for therapeutic use or analytical and scientific research when it comprises of 98 or more of the total cannabinoid content of the preparation and of course if any cannabinoid other than cannabidiol um it must only sorry cannabidiol any other cannabinoids i'm losing my words here uh must only be those found uh naturally in cannabis and comprise of two percent or less of the total cannabinoid content of that preparation so uh it would not be included schedule 4 when it's included in schedule schedule 3 and we'll have a look at that now so a schedule 3 entry for cbd or cannabidiol is a low-dose cbd entry so it is for oral oral mucosal and sublingual preparations included in the artg when the cannabidiol is either plant-derived or when synthetic only contains a certain anatomy and of course the cannabidiol comprises 98 or more of the total cannabinoid content and there's a couple of other requirements there including specific restrictions on dose packaging pack size and intended users so and i'd suggest having a look at the poison standard or susmp just to have a look at the different entries there if you are looking at supplying a product to see where your product might sit we do have other substances as well so as you can see on the slide here we do have nabiximoles uh nabalone and dronabinol which are listed as controlled drugs as well so that's uh schedule eight of the poison standard so any schedule eight controlled drug does require a prescription from an australian registered medical uh practitioner and there may be a certain state or territory requirements as well so we'll move on to manufacturing requirements so first of all we'll take a look at the tga manufacturing requirements under the therapeutic goods act which are different to the requirements of the office of drug control which we will cover up a bit later so therapeutic goods must be manufactured by a tta approved manufacturer when we look at manufacture we're looking at anything from packaging labeling processing testing uh release supply and some other steps that are listed on the slide here um all manufacturers must comply with the principles of good manufa good manufacturing practice or gnp so that's a term that you'll hear quite often now gmp or good manufacturing practice describes a set of principles and procedures which when followed by a manufacturer of therapeutic goods helps to ensure that each batch of a therapeutic good is safe reliable and of consistent high quality so manufacturers must obtain a gmp license or clearance for the manufacturing steps that they perform and also the type of medicine the tga website which includes a step-by-step guide around manufacturing medicines [Music] and you can also refer to the decision tool on the sme assist hub so this can help you and determine whether you're looking at um requiring gmp licensing or certification and and we'll go into the different types of requirements now so there are different processes that apply for obtaining approval from manufacturers in australia compared to overseas so if your manufacturer is located in australia they'll need to obtain a gmp license from the tga they'll have to submit a gmp application to us with the details about their manufacturing sites and their manufacturing steps so this would involve an on-site inspection and after the inspection and after the applications are assessed if a license is granted the manufacturer would then forward this slice these license details through to the sponsor for them to include their um include in their market authorization application so at the end of the day the sponsor is considered responsible for ensuring that their manufacturer does have a gmp license it is important to notice well that manufacturing inspections can happen happen at any time during the market authorisation process to ensure compliance now if your manufacturer is located overseas uh it would be the response the sponsor's responsibility to ensure that they have gmp clearance as opposed to a gmp license so we do have various international agreements and arrangements with other countries and jurisdictions these are called mutual recognition agreements or mras now for medicines and biologicals they're around 25 countries that we do have an mra with or an equivalent arrangement uh with australia you can find a list of these um countries on the tga website so do have a look there again if you need any assistance or guidance there you can always get in touch with us now again if your manufacturer is located overseas you do have a few options as far as obtaining gmp clearance so the first of course would be the mutual recognition agreement or mra pathway which you could use if your manufacturing site is within the borders of an mra country and your site has been inspected by that country's regulatory authority the second would be the compliance verification pathway which you could use if the manufacturer doesn't meet criteria for mra and the site has been inspected by an mra regulatory authority uh and the third and final would be the gmp certification pathway so you could use this pathway if the mra or cv pathways are not applicable or if there's no acceptable evidence from a recognised regulatory authority available so this pathway may also involve an on-site inspection by one of our gmp inspectors now the gmp clearance application assistance tool on the sme assist hub will help you determine the general evidence requirements for your gmp application so if you go to the tta website again under industry and select sme assist go to the interactive decision tools and you'll find that tool there again if you do need assistance with the tool or anything to do with gmp requirements or tga's manufacturing requirements uh you can always give us a call send us an email or send your inquiry direct to the gmp team there's contact details at the end of these slides so now we'll have a look at requirements uh around from the office of drug control so the office of drug control is part of the department of health odc regulates and provides advice on the import export and manufacture of controlled drugs as well as the cultivation of cannabis for medical purposes and medicinal purposes sorry to support australia's obligations under international drug conventions so a medicinal cannabis license authorizes either cultivation which is the growing of the cannabis plant or the production which is the separation of cannabis and cannabis resin or both there are no restrictions on the number of licenses that can be granted however under international conventions the overall quantities produced must not accept exceed domestic requirements so a cannabis we've also got uh cannabis research licenses so a cannabis research license uh authorizes the cultivation and or production of cannabis for research related to the medicinal use of cannabis so in order to obtain a cannabis research license an applicant will need to explain the purpose of the research and of course how it relates to medicinal cannabis and or medicinal cannabis products in all cases uh the licensee will need to hold a permit issued under the narcotic drugs act before any cultivation or production commences so for further information on the role of the office of drug control uh in the supply of medicinal cannabis in australia you can find some really helpful information on their website uh so that would be www dot dot a u we will provide the links here as well or by contacting them on the details that we'll provide now import and exported medicinal cannabis products between countries uh including those made from sorry low thc cannabis uh is tightly con controlled and subject to international drug conventions uh so approval must be granted by the national governments of both the importing and exporting countries before shipment can occur uh so as far as import into australia if a medical practitioner um considers a medicinal cannabis product suitable for a particular patient uh they can either apply through uh the special access scheme as we discussed earlier uh or the authorized prescriber scheme so these schemes do relate to unapproved therapeutic goods now if we have a look at the export of therapeutic goods provided the domestic supply of medicinal cannabis isn't affected some products are eligible for export if a license and a permit to export are granted so here we're looking at things like australian manufactured medicinal cannabis products that are manufactured under a gmp license also medicinal cannabis products that are listed as export only or registered on the australian register of therapeutic goods or artg so extracts of cannabis or extracts of cannabis resin manufactured under narcotic drugs active 1967 license and permit that are not in the form of a finished product may also be eligible so so really if the product doesn't appear on the artg either as an export only or registered medicine um or a license and permit to export the drug hasn't been issued by the office of drug control it wouldn't be permitted for export now uh if we look at wholesale a person who supplies unregistered medicinal cannabis products by wholesale is likely to contravene the therapeutic goods act of 1989 so those contraventions may result in a regulatory action under the therapeutic goods act and can also have implications for licenses issued under the narcotic drugs act so um customs that prohibited imports regulations and also state territory legislation so um it's important to have a look at the information that we do have available on our website around supply and wholesaling of medicinable medicinal cannabis products now um if we move on to supply so sponsors can submit an application to include schedule 4 cbd preparations in the aitg which are regulated as prescription medicines applications are individually evaluated for safety quality and efficacy and must meet all legislative requirements for therapeutic goods as set out in the applicable legislation so information on the application process and data requirements is available in the australian regulatory guidelines for prescription medicines uh and currently there are only two products approved so i'm now going to hand you over to clara kohlmeyer from our prescription medicines team to briefly take you through the application process over to you clara hi thanks steve you can hear me okay yes we can hear you thank you so i will be talking about the prescription medicines registration process which outlines um a number of different processes for prescription medicines uh we have different application types different categories uh and they are all all fairly detailed so as steve had mentioned you can refer to the uh australian regulatory guidelines for prescription medicines or you can always contact the application entry team and myself and my team will always uh help out with any questions if need be so for um sorry i think i've just got to sort out my slides um so for um prescription medicines there are different pre-application activities that you may consider before applying for a prescription medicine uh application to go through the process there's um also things to consider like the approved terminology for medicines and ingredient names then um this is a requirement before applying for a prescription medicine so this will also determine the type of medicine it is will determine the scheduling as well and whether or not it will have to come through the prescription medicines process there's a number of options available as well such as pre-submission meetings so at a pre-submission meeting you can discuss with the relevant clinical evaluation areas and all the other experts within our branch about your proposed pathway forward and if you've got any questions before you actually uh put in an application um all of our prescription medicine applications will require a product information document to be submitted or a draft pi at the time until it is approved uh consumer medicine information document as well and then towards you would also need to consider patent certification uh information and data exclusivity so data exclusivity uh for a new chemical entity is uh outlined in section 25a of the therapeutic goods act and it does talk about a five-year data explicit uh data exclusivity period uh from the registration of the new chemical entity the patent certification is required at the end of the process before the product is actually put on the aitg and that's outlined in section 26b of the therapeutic goods act um but again um i know there's a little um you know a lot of detail to take uh on board so yes please do contact us for more information uh especially about pre-submission meetings and any free application requirements so the different categories that we have within prescription medicines is uh category one applications they're our highest application category and category one applications do contain a number of different application types within that category so the highest one being a new chemical entity or a new biological medicine application and then we can go into an application type for an extension of indications so if you already have a medicine on the rtg and you wish to extend the indications for that medicine then that's our next highest category we also then have major variations where you may want to register a new strength uh or you know consider a new dose form uh all of these um our category one submission applications and even things such as uh changes to the clinical aspects of the product information document may require a category one submission to be submitted so category one submission does require clinical evaluation uh and at times toxicology and quality information and that's why they have the uh longer uh statutory time frame of 255 working days which is legislated um but then we can also consider a comparable overseas regulator uh category which may reduce the time frame um if um and i'll move on to the next slides to actually detail that process a bit more but it may reduce the legislative time frames down to 120 working days uh category three applications and minor variations are usually a standard 45 working day legislator time frame and um just as the name uh implies the minor variations it's minor changes to your registered good uh category three applications may be things like you know changes to shelf life and manufacturer information for example and do not have clinical or toxicology data um so the statutory processing times are outlined in the regulations and that's why why they are um legislated time frames um i've already uh mentioned the different application types that we have for our category one submissions so these are some of them just outlined on the slide um and and even things like new generic medicines are incorporated within our capital applications um as long as uh you're able to provide bipolar bioavailability data um and all of the required information for a new generic medicine um the key phases of milestones for a category one application is we have a pre-submission stage and this is different to a pre-submission meeting so a pre-submission meeting occurs outside any of the application processes whereas the pre-submission stage is what generates and initiates your application so this is what is required so once you've actually registered as a sponsor and you have your client id you can then go on to the tbs portal and submit a pre-submission application um and follow the processes at that stage uh with a pre-submission application it is mainly just to generate the submission number on our workflow system and then the next step the submission step is where the bossier is provided and the dossier is what includes all of the required information that we need to determine whether or not your application is actually acceptable for evaluation so this is just that determination stage to determine whether or not we'll accept the application for evaluation the rest of the steps then are what happens throughout the evaluation process we may reach out and ask section 31 questions and then follow the process through to the tga decision and then the administrative aspects of the post-decision process and writing the product onto the rtg if uh the evaluation or the product is approved so this is the comparative overseas regulator applications um what which we used to call category two submissions they have may have a reduced time frame of 120 working days or 175 working days depending on what part of the criteria you can meet there is certain criteria that you do have to mean such as that the application must be exactly the same in the comparable overseas regulators as well so we've got the countries listed on the slide um that we do accept evaluation reports from and but the criteria doesn't stop there the criteria means that the same application should have been submitted and the same evaluation must have been completed by those regulators um so they're not very common but they are becoming a lot more common as we start working closer with our overseas counterparts um criteria for uh full submissions uh is that it should be a category one submission um this criteria does not apply for any of our minor variations um so over the last few years we have been trying to streamline our processes and try to you know minimize the 255 working day time frame and as a result we've introduced a number of um various pathways to accompany our cap1 application and core application pathways so the priority review pathway does allow for a faster assessment of uh eligible prescription medicines but there is a determination stamp that is required prior to submitting an application and that this step also requires an application through our tvs portal and there is a very strict criteria that the sponsor would have to need to be able to receive a priority determination application if priority determination is granted then you may proceed with your category one submission with that priority pathway and the time frames evaluation time frames will be significantly reduced um as a result we've also introduced the provisional approval pathways which allows the sponsors to apply for time limited provisional registration on the rtg so the time frame is specific and eventually after a number of years and extensions if possible you will be able to submit all of the data required to have the product fully registered on the rtd so there is always a transition from the provisional to full but the provisional um pathway does provide earlier access to certain promising new medicines and again it does require the determination step prior to submitting the category one submission and it does uh have an even stricter criteria uh where uh our team of clinical experts within our prescription medicines authorisation branch will assess all of the determinations for provisional applications submitted to us and make sure that all of the eligibility criteria are met before the provisional approval is provided there's also uh requirements and the way we deal with our dossiers um because they are very complex and uh they do need to be our evaluation areas need to know where to find specific information we do specify and require that all of our applications dossiers are submitted in the common technical document format and that they do meet all of the general dossier requirements up until um recently or we are still accepting nice non-ectd uh submissions to the tga but please know that this is very quickly becoming um transitioning to full ectd requirements and all of those requirements they are very detailed again uh there's links on our website provided but if you do have any questions do reach out and we will um you know explain uh anything at all but basically the ectd uh common technical requirements do specify that there's certain modules that you have to provide and each one of those modules determines what type of application is within those modules so for example module one we'll have all your administrative aspects whereas module three will have all equality information and then module five will be your clinical information but as i said this is all specified in the common technical uh data requirements so for more information on our uh rather there's more information on our uh website and there's quite a bit of information um and especially with the introduction of our new provisional and priority uh determination pathways and our orphan criteria um you know it's probably best just to refer to all of these uh links and then if you don't understand any of those aspects do reach out to the application entry team and we'll be more than happy to answer any questions so i guess yes the final hints and tips is just to ensure and check that your product is a pre therapeutic order like a schedule for for a prescription medicine for example um decide whether you want to have it approved in your name to supply in australia because if this is the case then uh you must be a registered client within our client database uh and also note that you would have all regulatory activity responsibilities for that product once it is on the rtg and obviously throughout the evaluation process um so yes understanding the legal requirements um for the product and your legal responsibilities um and basically yeah determining if it meets a particular submission pathway and application type that can often be a little bit complicated and we do receive a lot of inquiries through the application entry inbox um about whether or not a particular submission um pathway is appropriate and what the application type should be and we do encourage sponsors before they submit the actual application through the portal to discuss um whether or not this is the right application with us as we would like to ensure the smooth transition of any application processing for both sides um i think that's at the end of it we will publish the what we call the auspah which provides a summary of the submission and the tga's evaluation of the company data submitted so the considerations and what what led to the decision making process for the tga to approve or not approve an application so we may have um ice powers on the system as well for rejected goods um but there is a lot of um negotiation that goes on with our sponsors in relation to this but yes one thing to consider is just that the os part is what we call a summary of the evaluation process it obviously doesn't detail the whole um evaluation pathway um and i think that's um me done steve yes yeah thank you for that clara it was really great um okay so uh now we're going to have a look at supply of medicinal cannabis as an over-the-counter medicine so just a bit of background on the 15th of december 2020 a final decision was made to down schedule certain low-dose cannabidiol or cbd preparations from schedule four which is a prescription medicine uh to schedule three which is a pharmacist only medicine so the final decision uh was that low-dose cbd products uh containing up to a maximum of 150 milligrams per day and a use for use in adults 18 years and over and used in oral oral mucosal and sublingual preparations that are packed in blister or strict packaging or in a container with child resistant closures and containing no more than 30 days supply in a pack and that meets specified formulation requirements uh in that this the cannabidiol that is either plant derived uh or when uh synthetic again as we discussed a little bit earlier only contains that certain cbd enantiomer and it also contains cannabidiol that comprises of 20 uh sorry 98 or more of the total cannabinoid content of the preparation so any um cannabinoids other than cannabidiol in these preparations must be those that are only naturally found in cannabis and can only comprise of two percent or less of the total cannabinoids content of the preparation and of which tetrahydrocannabinol or thc can only comprise of one percent um of the total cannabinoid content and those products would need to be approved by the tga and included on the artg so those products as per that determination can be supplied as over-the-counter medicines by pharmacists without a prescription so it is important to note that there are there may be other requirements set out in legislation uh including complying with advertising requirements uh and displaying any required warning statements uh on packaging as well so i'm now going to hand you over to kevin eager from our over-the-counter medicines space uh to take you through the application process for over-the-counter medicines so over to you kevin okay thanks steve okay in order to get an ogc medicine registered on the artg a sponsor must submit an application to the tga there are various application levels to register a new ogc medicine ranging in complexity from the n1 application pathway at the most simple level to end five at the highest or the most complex level an application to register an otc cbd medicine needs to come in at the m5 application level now these are non-generic medicines and fully evaluated for safety efficacy and quality there are guidance documents on the tga website specific itc medicines which detail the application process application formatting requirements and data requirements so the data are provided in ctd format as clara said that's the common technical document format guidance on the format of an application is included on the tga website in summary the data are provided in five modules modules one and two comprise the administrative and the summary admin and the summary data module three includes the quality data now an important point to note here in addition to the usual atc module 3 data requirements which are outlined on the website cbd applications along with many other n5 level applications will also require be required to include a module three point two point s component or if managed or if the product is manufactured the drug substance is manufactured by a third party then a dmf which is a drug master file this provides important information on the drug substance itself such as information on the manufacture of the substance classification and stability the module 4 data the module 4 includes the non-clinical data that includes toxicology data environmental genetic data the module 5 includes the clinical data now the clinical data on the formulation proposed for marketing in australia is expected this should also include a will include include dose-ranging studies to identify the minimum minimum effective dose which is specified for your product and specific for the therapeutic indication due to the lack of high quality published trials any literature submitted as part of an application is likely to be supportive at best further the relevance of the studies in the literature to the proposed product would need to be demonstrated all literature searches must be systematic searches there's guidance on the tta website on conducting a literature search the data supporting the safety and efficacy of the product must be relevant to the proposed therapeutic indications the patient population and the proposed dosage the therapeutic indication including any claims made on the labeling of the of the product must be suitable for a pharmacist's consultation therapeutic indications for a serious medical condition such as epilepsy depression anxiety disorders etc that require ongoing monitoring or advice from a doctor and not appropriate for an atc medicine sponsors are expected to follow the eu the relevant eu guidelines and the ich guideline documents and of course the australian regulatory guidelines for otc medicines um links to all of these guidance document documents can be found on the dji website and that's it for me i think it's over to melanie or maybe steve thank you for that kevin just bear with me a moment i just need to get my slides here okay so we'll just take a brief look now at advertising when it comes to supplying medicinal cannabis products um or therapeutic goods in general so advertising requirements um apply to all therapeutic goods uh although some medicines such as prescription medicines and biologicals do have requirements that mean they can't be advertised to consumers so it's important to be aware that advertising is considered any promotional material at all so that can include but not it is not limited to things like medicine labels including packaging tv advertisements websites including social media sites and potentially endorsement and social media sites and comments as well um now advertising is regulated by the therapeutic goods act of 1989 and the therapeutic goods regulations of 1990 as well as the therapeutic goods advertising code now there are certain circumstances when a good can't be advertised to the public so you can see some of the restrictions here on this slide so these do include but aren't again limited to pharmacists only medicines uh except for those that are included in appendix h of the poison standard uh it includes uh prescription medicines uh so if we're looking at prescription medicines of course we're looking at things that appear in schedules uh four or eight of the poison standard as we discussed earlier um also prohibited or restricted representations and less pre prior approval from the tga has been granted uh also advertising to health professionals and advertising for health services so we do on the sme assist hub of the tga website uh have a another handy decision tool uh it's called can i advertise this therapeutic good to the public so it's a decision tool and also um sorry a decision tool that will help you make that determination if you are supplying a therapeutic good and you're not too sure about whether or not you can advertise it jump onto the tga website uh do have a look at that tool uh go through it'll ask you a series of questions uh and at the end of that it will provide you some guidance uh if you're still unsure at that point uh please again feel free to give us a call here or drop us an email so we do have uh contact details uh at the end of the slides here today you should all have received a copy of the slides by now but if you haven't please don't hesitate to let us know just provide your email address and i can get those out to you now just back to uh advertising here while there are um advertising restrictions that do apply to therapeutic goods uh there might be circumstances in which the advertising of these goods might be permitted so for example in the interest of public health as an example of this in 2019 the tga did authorise advertisements for vaccines that are or form part of the commonwealth or state and territory health campaigns so we regulate advertising because not only can a false claim be misleading to the public it can also be really unsafe so it's important that we do regulate and monitor advertising of therapeutic goods so the advertising code applies to all therapeutic goods to varying degrees it does outline key requirements that must be met when advertising to the public so do make sure that you jump on and familiarize yourself with this piece of legislation and understand what you can and cannot do when it comes to advertising therapeutic goods so that advertising code is available on the advertising hub on the tga website again if you're having any trouble with it or need any assistance you can give us a call drop us an email or you can submit an inquiry through the advertising compliance hub as well so if you do have specific questions uh relating to advertising you can also contact the advertising team uh using the details that we'll provide on a later slide uh you can contact them directly there is the advertising enquiries um option on the advertising compliance hub as well so i highly recommend you have a look at that but again you can always pick up the financing so that brings us to the end of this section i'm now just going to hand you back to rachel for some housekeeping before we take a break thanks it's a steven to get through isn't it a lot to take in so i'm just going to go through some um basic information that may be of assistance to you um so my name is rachel i'm from the 2g conferencing events i'm also part of the sme assist team so this is the sme assist website that stephen had mentioned earlier on and which i believe are provided to you in the link there is the phone number there we are actual people on behind behind that 1-800 numbers so don't be afraid to give that one a call social media slides are you aware that we're on the facebook twitter youtube topic blogs linkedin and instagram there's all the information there for those and i will send those out into the slide out into the chat function a little later as well some of our important contact information you might find that you'd like to have close by in handy we have our tga info line over the counter medicine email address our prescription branch medicines email for application entries and the office of drug control advertising team for any of your advertising inquiries and the unapproved products

XJc_-vwH5EE,All you need to know about Australia’s burgeoning medicinal cannabis industry,2021-06-07T12:20:43Z,
ERl9V7Y7Jxg,Changes to sponsor requirements for supplying unapproved medicinal cannabis products in Australia,2021-12-02T06:06:32Z,so i'd like to start by acknowledging the um traditional owners of the lands on which we're meeting today so here in canberra um that's the new normal people but i'd like to acknowledge that we're meeting across a large number of lands today and i'd like to acknowledge um elders um sorry pay my respects to elders past present and emerging across all of those lands and i'd like to extend that acknowledgement and respect to any aboriginal or terrorist straight island peoples that we have here today i'll start by introducing myself my name is petra bismayer i'm the director of the experimental products section here at the tga so we look after access to unapproved therapeutic goods so that includes medicines biologicals and medical devices and that's namely via the special access scheme and the authorized prescriber scheme so in today's session i'll be um talking um through your obligations as a sponsor um and help to help you understand the change the changes in sponsor requirements when supplying an unapproved medicinal cannabis product under the unapproved patient access schemes in australia so we'll be covering the removal of the tj93 declaration form uh the introduction of a new sponsor six monthly reporting form which is uh which streamlines the existing reporting obligations and how the move to sas and ap applications by active ingredient will affect you as a sponsor so i'll move through the presentation and then i'll allow some time at the end of today's presentation for questions there's some pre-submitted questions and uh that we'll we'll address and then we'll move on to the live questions so i'll start with the removal of the tj93 declaration form so as of today we've removed the requirement for sponsors to submit a declaration of conformity um with the tgo 93 for every product it's important to note that you're still required by law to ensure that your products comply with the tgo 93 however the declaration form is no longer required but as you're aware unapproved medicinal cannabis products imported into or supplied or manufactured in australia must conform with therapeutic goods um standard for medicinal cannabis that brought a number 93 which we refer to as the tj93 so this order specifies the minimum quality requirements for medicinal cannabis products and we've removed the form the requirement for the declaration form following an internal review designed to reduce regulatory burden for industry and administrative burden for prescribers and to allow tj approvals by active ingredient so it's important to note that your responsibilities to comply with tj93 haven't changed sorry i'll move the slides along might help you um so it's important to note that your responsibilities haven't changed and you remain legally responsible for your products conforming with the tj9 number 93 as well as other applicable orders including tgo 100 which is the microbiological standard for medicines and as you're aware it's an offence under the act to import export or supply therapeutic goods that do not conform with an applicable standard and breaches are subject to a range of compliance actions including civil and criminal penalties under the act under the therapeutic goods act up here i've got some guidance documents that are included on the tga website they'll provide you with additional guidance for complying with therapeutic good orders such as tj 93 and tj 100 oh i've heard notification that i can't be heard is it that i can't be heard clearly or or it can't be heard at all okay this is rachel here i've just sent out the link for those of you who may be experiencing audio issues you can um dial through if that's an alternative um you may be experiencing bandwidth issues maybe so give that a go as an alternative so you can actually see and hear through the telephone as an option thank you thanks for the feedback sounds like most most people are able to hear clearly so that's good to know um so i'll move on to ongoing targeted testing so as you're aware um um as you're aware rather than collecting tg093 forms we'll instead be diverting resources to expand our teacher 93 compliance programs so we'll be continuing our audits which include laboratory testing and this includes but it isn't limited to consistency with claims of the stated content of active ingredients as well as analysis of toxins and impurities in these medicines and we'll be doing these testing this testing on a random basis as well as targeted testing you're also reminded that your goods must comply with a therapeutic goods advertising code so that all material with information about the goods so that includes the label must be truthful balanced and not misleading and otherwise promote safe and proper use so i'll move on now to [Music] sponsor reporting obligations under regulation 47b of the therapeutic goods regulations and so we've developed a new six monthly reporting form to streamline this uh this requirement but it's important to know that this is an existing requirement so we've we've introduced a new form that will help make this reporting easier for you um so under this form um sponsors must detail the product supplied including the trade name and the quantity supplied in australia by the sponsor under each access pathway during the period to which the report relates so i've included the form itself and you can see here um that you must record the active ingredients the tray name of the product in the case of medicinal cannabis products unapproved sponsors of medicinal cannabis products must record the category of cannabinoid content and we'll cover that that next but there is a footnote here a key with um with with details of those categories the quantity that you supplied in the six month period and under which pathway you supplied that good now the reporting periods are from from january to june and from july to december inclusive and reports must be submitted within one month of the end of the reporting period and it's important to know that this isn't a new requirement um so this is an existing requirement so for um the current six-month period that we're in will end in december and you'll be required to submit reports of your usage um by the end of january these six monthly reporting forms um will be used to inform um the product um the names of products on the teacher website that i'll be taking you through later so it's important these reports are submitted in a timely fashion in order that product names can be included on the tga website so we'll as i mentioned we'll be submitting will be publishing on the tga website medicinal cannabis product details by active ingredient products uh but sorry about active ingredient categories um and the pub the idea of the publishing of this information is to support healthcare professionals in prescribing and supplying medicinal cannabis products i'll go through that in a moment but firstly i just wanted to touch on the reporting of side effects so the tga has an important role in monitoring the safety of unapproved medicines we investigate significant safety concerns as a part of ensuring product safety in the australian community and there's multiple ways in which you can in which you can report adverse events and defects and further information is available on the tta website but our preferred reporting route is via the online portal and the the link is just included here so adverse events or defects associated with the use of a medicine must be reported to the tga within 15 calendar days so i'll move on to our decision to move sas and authorized prescribed applications um away from trade name and to applications by active ingredient so these changes have been made to reduce the administrative burden for prescribers as we were finding prescribers had to reapply for new product specific tj approvals very frequently due to stock shortages and discontinuations as well as name changes as you're aware a change to the name of a product renders that product separate and distinct under the act and a new approval would be needed so the move to active prescribing by active ingredient provides prescribers with greater flexibility in what they choose to to write on their prescriptions so this will reduce administrative burden for prescribers as they'll no longer require a separate approval for their for their patient for a specific branded product if that becomes um if that's suddenly discontinued or is in shortage um so application approvals will no longer be granted for a specific product or brand however we recognize the complexity of the cannabinoid content of medicinal cannabis products and so we've decided to allow submissions on the basis of broad category of cannabinoid content and we've developed five broad categories that i'll be going through so this change essentially means that prescribers would obtain approval for a category and then issue prescriptions for any product that they like that falls within that category and that just means that they don't need to reapply to the tta for approval every time importantly the approvals will remain specific to dosage form and indication and ultimately these changes are expected to improve patient access for appropriate patients so next i'll take you through [Music] the five active ingredient categories that have been developed um and hopefully you can see that um clearly on your screen uh here but we have um we have five um medicinal cannabis categories sorry and we've framed these categories around the content of cannabidiol in the product and you can see that in the in the column there on your right so category one products um these products meet the different the the schedule for prescription only um definition as laid out in the poison standard or the susmp and for these products cannabidiol comprises 98 or more of the total cannabinoid content of the medicine and the remaining two percent um can be made up of other cannabinoids and that may include thc and importantly the uh the medicine must contain no other active ingredients um for category two medicinal cannabis products we're calling cbd dominant medicinal cannabis products and you can see here that um category 2 products are made up of between 60 and 98 cannabidiol with the remainder being made up of um of other other cannabinoids so it's important to note that we've framed the categories around the content of cannabidiol because that's the lower risk cannabinoid um so this means that um there's flexibility for um for products which are higher in which for products um which which are dominant in cannabinoid other than thc or cbd so with these next products although we've sort of named them according to thc content because we acknowledge that these that thc is likely to be the more the most dominant um second the most dominant um cannabinoid other than a kind of a dial um it does allow flexibility for products which are dominant in other cannabinoids to be captured under these categories um so category three is what we're calling balanced medicinal cannabis products and essentially they contain around 50 50 cbd and and thc in general but it could be um other cannabinoids as well um so as you can see from the definition here these products um are comprised of between 40 and 60 cannabidiol with the remaining cannabinoid content being made up of other other products which may include thc category 4 products we're calling the thc dominant medicinal cannabis products but again they could be made up of they could be dominant in other cannabinoids the key thing here is that cannabidiol makes up between 2 and 40 of the cannabinoid content and the remainder can be made up of other cannabinoids and category 5 products which we're naming thc medicinal cannabis products are made up of between two percent and zero percent um cbd um and we acknowledge that some of those may be maybe up maybe pure thc um so i hope that that clarifies the the categories i thought i'd provide an example of what a tga approval letter would look like under these changes that are effective from today so an authorized prescriber letter for example um we'll just have the category um here category 1 cbd medicinal cannabis product and for the indication refractory anxiety in adult patients assess assass product um again we'll just include the category and so doctors so doctors will become we'll gain tj approval for these um for this category but doctors can include more detail in the prescription so for example they may wish so they will need to include um details of the active ingredient um dosage form we're clinically appropriate they may wish to include the brand name but these changes simply mean that a new tj approval letter is not needed every time and this is in line with all other approved medicines for which we don't have a brand name [Music] so as i mentioned we'll also be publishing a list of medicinal cannabis products by category on the tj website and that's in recognition of the complexity of the cannabinoid content and the difficulty that prescribers and pharmacists may run into so um we'll be publishing a list of active of medicinal cannabis products by trade name according to the active ingredient categories um on the tj website um the list will is likely to go up this afternoon or tomorrow um it's currently under review to ensure um the product names are compliant with um a compliant with legislation um so there's been a delay on the uploading of those of those particular product names and we'll also be making sponsor details available to facilitate patient access okay so in terms of further support um we've updated all of our web pages um on the medicinal cannabis hub so if you're familiar with the tj webpage you'll be able to go to the medicinal cannabis hub or otherwise you can just search medicinal cannabis in in the tji website in our webpage find the medicinal cannabis hub and there's a special page for sponsors and manufacturers we've also created a number of support tools so that's the description of active ingredients the links are included here a list of medicinal cannabis products by category of active ingredient and also the authorized prescriber scheme list of medicines with an established history of use so um it may not be particularly relevant to sponsors but in the healthcare professional webinars that i've been delivering i've been going into i've been explaining the addition of category one two and three medicinal cannabis products um for specific indications um in the authorized prescriber list of medicines with an established history of use and these these particular products can be applied prescribers medical practitioners only can apply to become authorized prescribers of these particular products by category dosage form and by indication where it's included on that list without the need to obtain ethics committee approval prior to applying to the tga we've also updated our guidance documents um so that's the authorized prescriber guidance document the sas online system guidance document and the authorized prescriber online system document and we'll be making the slides from this webinar available after after the presentation finishes um so i'll move on now um there's been some some some questions um pre-submitted um prior to the webinar that i can um that we can answer um and then and and then once we're finished with those we'll be moving into um into the live questions okay so as i mentioned there was a few um there was an opportunity to submit questions um prior to the webinar um so we'll start with answering a few of those and then we'll move into the live questions okay thanks petra so we've got a question here about wholesaling has there been any changes to wholesaling of medicinal cannabis products thanks okay so no wholesaling of unapproved finished medicinal cannabis products is remains prohibited however there is scope within the regulatory framework for sponsors to enter into distribution arrangements with third parties to assist them with supplying finish finished medicinal cannabis products this means that if you're a sponsor and you import or manufacture finished products that are not entered in aitg you can only supply those products if they are held under your direct control until they're supplied under an approved pathway to an authorized prescriber or under the special access scheme approval holder sorry to the approval holder you also have to comply with certain conditions that are specified in the regulations so it's important to note that we've published updated guidance about what the direct control requirement means in practice and the reason that requirement is imposed on legislation is to make sure that the sponsor remains responsible for product control and supply decisions throughout the supply chain and this is necessary because we're dealing with unapproved therapeutic goods and the role of the tgas to manage the risks of unlawful supply uh to ensure to ensure necessary public health alerts and recalls are managed appropriately great thanks petra we've got a question about clinical trials so as a clinical trial sponsor using tj93 compliant products in our ctn what change is going what are the changes going forward when an imp so that's um [Music] investigational medicinal uh medicinal product is declared as tgo93 compliant and how do we know this great thanks akane so we're amending the ctn portal so that it no longer requests clinical trial sponsors to submit a tj93 declaration form and instead an alert will be shown requesting acknowledgement of a sponsor's legal responsibilities in ensuring that the product complies with the tj93 and all other relevant orders when an imp or an investigational medicinal product changes updating submission of the tj93 declaration associated with the ctn won't be required however sponsors are required to update the online ctn form with the new imp and to ensure that the new inp complies with tgn93 as well as all other relevant orders thanks patreon we've got a question about testing so will the tj look towards testing all australian cannabis products great thanks okay so a larger number of medicinal cannabis products will be selected for tests for laboratory for targeted laboratory testing as well as random testing and other compliance assessment activities will be undertaken as part of our teacher 93 audits so as i mentioned in the presentation this includes testing for consistency with claims of the stated content of active cannabinoid content as well as for the presence of toxins and impurities great thanks petra there's a few questions in regards to approvals prior to the current changes so will approvals granted under the current scheme prior to november 22 allow medicine substitution or will a new script or approval be required great thank you so much cannabis sas and ap approvals that were granted prior to today um will still remain valid for the duration of the um of the approval period that's specified on the approval letter but they'll be relevant only to that particular brand as has been the case until until today if the prescriber wants to to get an approval letter under the sas or ap for generic prescribing under the categories then they'll need to apply um to the tga for that approval thanks petra next question how are quality standards going to be enforced under the new requirements the sponsors of medicinal cannabis products as we've outlined in the presentation continue to be legally responsible for ensuring that their products comply with the teacher 93 and other relevant orders you're just no longer required to submit the declaration of compliance so we'll continue as i mentioned many times we'll be continuing our program of targeted laboratory testing and other compliance assessment and we'll be diverting resources from the receipt receipt and entering of the tj93 declaration forms um to the laboratories to expand our testing programs great i can see a few questions coming through about gmp so we've got a question here about what about ensuring products are manufactured under gmp and that stability studies are done to confirm shelf life great thank you so gnp requirements at present for medicinal cannabis products uh remain the same but as you be aware we held a public consultation in january of this year regarding this issue um and changes will be brought into place and they're expected to be effective from from approximately march um next year that will level the playing field um to require gmp for imported products there's also going to be another public consultation later this year to um to to outline further detail thanks petra so i've just gone to the live chat we've got a question here about tgo93 if tg093 isn't required how do we get new products not on the new cat system so doctors can apply for ap or suspi so i'm guessing this is in regards to the published list okay so in regards to the authorized prescriber established history of use list this is a list that of particular products that have been um deemed to be have established history of use in australia and haven't had any major safety concerns in the last three years and this is an internal review and sponsors can't apply to have their to have particular products um included on the on the on this list um this is purely an internal review and it's done on the basis um largely of quantity in order to reduce the burden um of sas b applications so we do routine reviews every sort of uh approximately 12 months um and we update um many products we include many products on this established history of use list and in this round of updates we've included categories one two one and two for oral oral liquids and capsules for the indications chronic pain and anxiety and category 3 products have been included for oral liquids and capsules for the indication of chronic pain and there's further information on this pathway available for prescribers on our website it's petrol i'm gonna i should hear about release of products from the sponsor how does a sponsor release product to a pharmacy without a product specific sas sorry so the question is is how does it yeah it's i guess it's in terms of how does the sponsor verify which product they're releasing and this depends i guess on the prescription that's right so the doctor will outline further detail um about what product they wish to prescribe on a prescription the changes that we're we're introducing from today simply cut regular cut administrative burden for prescribers it means that they don't have to come back to the tga every time i'm gonna tell us what brand they wish to use instead they can put that information on the prescription um including for example they may wish to prescribe um you know a cannabidiol 10 milligram per ml and thc 10 milligram per meal product and that that particular doctor may or may not wish to if they believe it's clinically suitable include details such as the the what particular brand they wish to prescribe and and a pharmacist can choose to um to you know substitute different brands provided that that's done in accordance with normal practice and where necessary with consultation with the prescriber so for example a pharmacist may wish to consult with a prescriber if a prescription is not clear um and then they they may request a new prescription but the key thing is that they won't then need to go back to the tga to issue a new approval so we've got a question here about if a doctor is an authorized prescriber under tj do they need to get new south wales authority to prescribe for a compounded product thanks um so um medicinal cannabis products may in some states and territories require additional authorization or approval as you're aware um but it's the we believe it's that you know the um the requirement to understand the the legislation in the state that they're operating up in is up to that prescriber and the tga can't comment on the particular jurisdictional requirements across the different states and territories so the prescriber is encouraged to if they have any questions um about their their legal requirements um within this their state of territory or practice to contact their relevant state or territory health department and we've got we've included contact details for those states and territories on our website when it comes to extemporaneous compounding again there's no changes at this stage but this was a question that was raised during the public consultation earlier this year and we are looking um to introduce a requirement for products which are extemporaneously compounded to require approval and a sas or ap and again these changes are likely to come in next next year great thanks petra i've got a question here about the published list on the website of medicinal cannabis products is it mandatory to complete the form for publication of product details on the tj website for unapproved medicinal cannabis products um so the form that was sent around to all sponsors is not mandatory however future updates will be done on the basis of sponsor six monthly reporting forms um and those are the report forms that are required under regulation 47b of um of our regulations and that is a mandatory requirement so sponsors must submit to us every six months the names and quantities of um products supplied and under and under which pathway um so we'll be receiving those forms and we'll be using data from um from those forms um to keep the list of products up to date we were hoping to have that list available on the on the website already but that's going to be going up later today or tomorrow we just need to review the product names to ensure that they're compliant with legislation great thanks um petra we've got a great question here about the changes and how they refl how they'll be reflected on the tga portal so will the tga portal be updated to reflect changes in relation to these new to these products uh yes so we have updated um the available options that um that prescribers can choose from in the in the sas and authorized prescriber online system so the um product specific or brand specific um trade name trade names have been removed and instead approvals um will be granted by by category um and so sub prescribers will choose um from from one of the five categories when of medicinal cannabis when they're processing their um their applications so we've got a question regarding documentation um do you does a sponsor have to have a copy of the sas b or ap approval um prior to supply yes so under uh under schedule five of our act of our regulations um sponsors must not release unapproved goods um from their direct control until those goods are subject to assass authorization or sas or ap um approval or authorization so um unapproved there's no changes to um to to these arrangements so sponsors must hold unapproved goods under their direct control until um you're satisfied that you've seen evidence of approval of the sas or authorized prescriber to release those goods thanks petra so we've got a question here about sas b and ap approval durations how long does a tga sas b approval last for for a patient under the new changes so there's no changes to the approval duration for sas fee applications and those are typically approved for 24 months however as always the the delegate has discretion to to to amend that but um typically uh 24 months um approval uh four authorized prescriber applications um under the streamlined pathway so that's um categories one two and three um for chronic pain um and for anxiety for categories one and two um no ethics committee approval is required and typically approvals will be granted for five years again there's uh that's open to delegate discretion um but typically every five years however um authorized prescribers are instead required to submit to us um their patient usage um every six months and the periods the reporting periods are the same it's for the regulation 47b um sponsor reporting um so those periods are january uh till june and july to december and uh forms must be submitted within one month of the reporting period finishing thanks patrick we've got a question here about code so do the categories have specific codes and if so what are these yes they do so the categories um and codes are included um both on the authorized prescriber application form and on the list the authorized prescriber established history of useless and this information has been made available on the tj website in all our guidance documents um and i've been outlining it for prescribers um in in our webinars um but as a as a sponsor when it comes to recording which pathway you've supplied your goods under for your six monthly reporting forms it doesn't matter whether the product has come in under the standard ap pathway authorized prescriber pathway which requires ethics committee approval or whether that um application so that that um prescription has come in under the the new the streamlined pathway um so but you will be required to differentiate whether you've supplied uh products under the authorized prescriber pathway or the sas pathway and um sponsors can can know which pathway those came under obviously on the basis of the approval letters also still getting um quite a few questions coming through regarding pharmacist substitution um generic prescribing so um so essentially um a pharmacist would um and would be empowered to do generic substitution in a as per normal um dispensing practice so the tga um and prescribing or prescriptions are come under the remit of states and territories so the tga will provide approval under category under a category of cannabinoid content and then the doctor is required to provide as much detail as they think the pharmacist needs in order to issue a prescription so for example they might they may prescribe a product which is um you know 10 milligrams per ml of thc and 12 milligrams per meal of cbd as long as that prescriber also holds an approve an approval for a category three balanced product um the tga doesn't get involved then in what particular product would be dispensed that's a matter for the pharmacist and the doctor to describe and that's no different from any other from from normal practice so if the pharmacist felt that there wasn't enough information on the script um then they would contact the doctor to ask for further information um if they if they if a particular brand was out of stock they may call they may call the prescriber and they may wish to ask for a new prescription if that was uh necessary or they may be able to they may they may um interchange that product um if it's appropriate so um when it comes to prescript uh prescribing and prescriptions um these fall into the agreement of state and territory um legislation and um pharmacists and medical practitioners requirements under their relevant boards of practice um so these are simply prescription medicines uh and they should be treated differently to other prescription medicines with the exception of the requirement for um unapproved medicines to to have a sass or ap approval in place so the question here uh another question has come through how does the sponsor know if the pharmacist switches brand well you'll know if your product has left your warehouse and you you should know under which scheme that has left the warehouse so then you'll know you'll be able to provide that information on your sponsor report um on side effects reporting both there's a question here on side effects reporting so both sponsors and prescribers have responsibilities to report side effects and so our preferred reporting route for that is via the online portal and thanks everyone for attending this afternoon if you do have any further questions if

X0yxrrKgEKc,World-first study uses medicinal cannabis to treat insomnia,2018-04-30T04:44:44Z,"This trial is looking at the effects of
medicinal cannabis on the treatment of insomnia. Insomnia is really prevalent in
the population it's the most common sleep disorder insomnia is a difficulty
in getting to sleep or staying asleep or waking up too early and it has an impact
on people's daily functioning or quality of life we know from anecdotal evidence
and also from evidence in other trials for example looking at the use of
cannabis on in treating certain pain conditions that it potentially has side
effects which are sedating so we believe that it may be useful in people who have
difficulty sleeping it's going to be taken under the tongue and it's an oil
formulation and people it's point five of a mill and people will take it
nightly about one hour before they are wanting to go to sleep the trial is a
randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial so
what that means is that we'll be looking at their sleep over baseline two week
period and then they will have the placebo all the active medication for
two weeks and then cross over and have the opposite for two weeks and they
won't be told which is which and us as the investigators won't know either
until the very end when we unwind the trials there are a lot of people who
suffer from insomnia and I mean this is these are the people that are telling us
as well I think there's a lot of people that live with it without seeking help."

11GeNIFXMJY,"Medical cannabis is on the rise – but does it work? | Epilepsy, Chronic Pain &amp; Sleep",2019-05-12T09:00:01Z,"[Music] more Australians are using medicinal cannabis and ever before we know this because more than 3000 scripts were approved last year by the Therapeutic Goods Administration medicinal cannabis isn't easy to access and it can be very expensive so the people who use illegally well they're just the tip of the iceberg it's thought as many as 100,000 Australians self-medicate illegally for everything from back pain to sleep problems getting access to pain relief is of course a good thing but when it comes to the evidence for medicinal cannabis well the picture is mixed there's still a lot that we don't know so far research into cannabis has been difficult partly because it's still illegal in many places but also because of how complex the cannabis plant is cannabis contains more than 400 bioactive molecules about 100 of which are cannabinoids it's thought that these cannabinoids tap into one of the human body's natural systems the endocannabinoid system there are two cannabinoids that you've probably heard of THC or tetra hydro tetra hydro hydro can I do that into tetrahydrocannabinol or THC and cannabidiol or CBD THC is no important psychoactive effects it's the thing that's so high CBD doesn't but both are thought to have therapeutic effects different cannabis strains contain different ratios of THC to CBD and when you add that to the different ways cannabis can be consumed the various types of products available the different doses and research methods used it means that clinical trials have vary a lot in 2017 Australian researchers did a systematic review that's like the gold standard for evidence and they found that on the whole the evidence for medicinal cannabis is limited and it should only be used when registered medicines have been unsuccessful so what is the evidence the strongest case for its use is with children and young people with drug-resistant epilepsy CBD products have been shown to reduce the frequency of seizures by up to 50% or more in up to half of pediatric patients the evidence for its using chronic pain is a little more contested a large US study in 2017 found substantial evidence that cannabis containing both CBD and THC could effectively treat chronic pain but Australian researchers have found that the effect is likely to be modest when it comes to the relaxing qualities of cannabis well there is some evidence that medicinal products can help to improve people's sleep but a lot more research is needed and that goes for nearly all conditions which is why there are a number of clinical trials underway here in Australia and around the world what's your experience are you taking which is not kind of this leave us a comment below or subscribe by clicking here and cabinet camp cannabis kind of cannabidiol cannabidiol"

EFGZCnheMDI,MCAID Swinburne University Medicinal Cannabis &amp; Driving Study Victoria Australia,2022-03-22T23:51:08Z,hey everyone tom brown here co-founder of honolee and today i'm with dr tom arkell a research fellow at swinburne university who studies medicinal cannabis and its effects on driving tom's running the mc aid study that will investigate cannabis effect on driving over the course of a three-month period tom's here to tell us a bit about his research and how patients in victoria can get involved thanks for joining me today tom thanks for having me awesome so to get us started can you tell us a bit more about mcad who's running the trial where is it happening and so on so the trials being run at the center for human psychopharmacology at swinburne university in hawthorne in melbourne this study in particular has been uh funded by the department of health and human services and this is a really sort of long-term uh study that's the focal point of some of our cannabis and driving research that we've got going on in our lab here amazing so tell us a bit about the aim of the mca study so the aim of the study is to look at how medicinal cannabis treatment affects driving and cognitive performance over time so generally studies often look at just the acute effects of cannabis so immediately after vaping or taking oil for example whereas in this case we're really interested in seeing how does it actually affect driving and cognition over those first few months of treatment so you know for example at that stage when impairment may be greatest in that first set of month when you're getting used to a new medicine and then up to three months later when patients tend to be stable and used to the effects of the medication great and you've already touched on the cannabis and drug driving now this sounds like it could be very important regarding the cannabis and drug driving laws can you tell us a bit more about that and and how this may impact australians and patients more broadly you know i think the restriction on driving for patients who are using medicinal cannabis is really probably one of the biggest barriers that that patients face it's also a barrier to many patients who may be interested in trying medical cannabis but who feel that they're you know essentially unable to give up the freedoms that come along with driving so this trial is i suppose one of the first steps in getting some real world evidence uh around what medicinal cannabis actually does to driving you know if you're using it over a long period of time uh what sort of effects does it begin to have uh over time so i think this will go some way towards uh affecting uh policy here and overseas and the other thing is we don't really have any good guidelines around how long patients should wait before driving you know i think doctors are in a similar position where they don't always know what to tell patients because we just don't have that information available so outside of australia even i think this will go some way to helping us to develop guidelines uh that can then be used by by doctors and by their patients and policymakers as well that sounds great so can can you tell us a bit how about how the trial works yes so the way it works is that we're looking for new patients who are just about to start using medicinal cannabis for the first time so the idea is that you would come in before you actually use it for the very first time between that time when uh you see your doctor script gets authorized and then you actually go and pick it up from the pharmacy uh we'll have you come into the lab for a couple of hours before then so we can get some baseline measures uh we can see how your driving and cognition is before you've actually started using cannabis and then you would come back each month after that it's about one two and three months and that way we get a really comprehensive i suppose picture of what your driving cognitive performance looks like at those different stages of treatment great that sounds really interesting and and can you tell us just as a little bit of a recap can you be really clear on what the requirements are for individuals who would be eligible for the trial so to be eligible for this study you must have chronic pain it's restricted to people with chronic pain you must be 21 years or over you must have your foot driver's license and he must have not used any cannabis in a month prior to enrollment now there's no restrictions on product type that's totally your doctor's discretion we're expecting that patients may be changing uh the medication they're using over the course of of the few months of the trial and that's part of what we're looking at here it's a naturalistic study where we're not deciding or giving you a particular product we're simply observing you as you're using a product a doctor would normally prescribe great this sounds really exciting and i think patients will actually really want to get involved in this is there any sort of cost to the patient or or remuneration for the patients participating in the trial so the only cost for the patient is is really in terms of your time each session takes around two to three hours the first one's a little bit shorter the ones that one two and three months are a little bit longer around three to four hours so there's the time commitment um but you will be renumerated for your time so for completion of the whole study uh you'll receive up to 800 there's 150 for each session to help cover your time and travel costs and then two hundred dollar completion bonus for finishing the whole protocol great um so just to wrap this up can you tell patients how they can get started um or what what the best pathway to get involved is from here so the first thing to do is to download the participant information form uh which will be linked to here on the website the honolulu website um from there download that have a look through it find out a bit more information about the study and see whether you think this might be the right thing for you if you think it is take that to your doctor have a conversation with them from there the thing to do is scan the qr code which will be on the last page of that document that will link you to a redcap website from there answer a few questions put in your contact details and then either myself or another member of the research team will be in touch with you to discuss further great um we will make sure to have some links up and and for those of you watching you'll have just seen some of the information on the screen um before we wrap up is there anything else you want to say to everyone tom well thanks for having me on here and thanks for giving me the opportunity uh to talk about this study i think this is a really important study is certainly something that i've been interested in getting up and running for a while um gathering real world evidence around how cannabis is actually affecting driving patients is obviously a crucial question something that we don't really have much evidence around what this study is going to do is it's going to help us build an evidence base that can be then used to actually guide policy both here in australia and overseas amazing it's very very exciting work that you're doing we really appreciate you being here and look forward to having you back thank you

l8J9TC6uHWM,The Legalise Cannabis MPs lobbying for change in Victoria | 7.30,2023-03-01T02:30:30Z,thank you [Music] [Music] there's nothing quite like first day nerves especially when all eyes are on these two new Victorian MPS [Music] I'd rather would use cannabis for socializing than alcohol I like to wind down with cannabis I have been both a recreational and a therapeutic user of cannabis now for 42 years at the risk of showing my age yeah shank and Rachel Payne are talking about is illegal in Victoria but they're legalized cannabis party MPS and as the name suggests they're on a mission this is us here yep and it just really struck home to me that I'm I'm having this cannabis it's in my own home I'm not hurting anyone and I'm breaking the law and the system is just really wrong on this issue all right we're going to do whatever we need to do to achieve sensible regulation of cannabis in Victoria [Music] they'll likely have the balance of power in the upper house which will make them very influential David's today enjoying everyone's everyone's teaching four percent of Victorian voters gave Rachel and David their first preferences [Music] parties rise in popularity coincides with a boom in medicinal cannabis 335 000 scripts have been issued across Australia over the past six years it is growing quickly there's been significant investment in the industry mated 400 million dollar industry and this production facility here in Mildura is one of the largest in Australia this facility operates year-round so it can produce capacity of around 12 and a half thousand kilograms of dry flour out of this facility this is uh for for patient use here in Australia and potentially for export as well [Music] group is one of about 40 ASX listed medicinal cannabis companies but doctors aren't rushing to endorse the drug the evidence shows that there are lots of other treatments that provide benefit and that needs to be explored first in terms of doctor pushback it's it's a whole new area so prohibition has meant that there hasn't been the research done in in this space and Australia is is one of those key medical markets that has a very conservative approach to showing me the evidence medicinal cannabis has become a business model versus a healthcare solution so now what we see is Big Business have taken over the Cannabis prescribing area you see it on buses you see it in your social media and now what's happening is that we're having patients think that this is the first protocol versus the last protocol in 2020 I developed an immuno condition which was undoubtedly the most painful thing I've ever experienced and I would find myself most evenings just sitting on the back deck um having a joint and it was actually really really good for just relaxing me and reducing my nervousness the majority of people we see who are using medicinal cannabis are accessing it through the illicit market and one of the things that I would love to see is that you can grow your own at home growing or possessing cannabis without a script is still illegal everywhere except for the ACT where a small amount has been decriminalized for private use [Music] the people still do it because it's far cheaper than purchasing it legally at a pharmacy usually people come in with chronic pen or anxiety or insomnia this sort of means three main areas I see over here medicinal cannabis is a medication of Last Resort so they don't just walk off the streets with like oh I've just got a acute pain and I'm here for it so it's usually chronic it's been on for years it's not a simple process most GPS and prescribing nurses have to apply to the TGA for a special permit each and every time they want to prescribe a patient with cannabis so prices can range from seventy dollars right up to three hundred and fifty dollars or more the whole idea about medicinal cannabis is that we can guarantee what's in the bag and so what sort of questions do people have about medicinal cannabis is there a level of hesitation still when people come here the question to ask most is about driving what do people ask if they're put over by the drug bust would they be charged if they've got cannabis in their system then the answer is yes because it's only about presence not impairment that's the first thing these new Victorian MPS want to change we're looking for cannabis to be treated exactly in the same way that any other prescription drug is treated which is if you've got a script and you're not demonstrating signs of impairment then you should be able to go around your business you were wondering when I was going to get to cannabis they've taken their seats in the Victorian parliaments the current cannabis prohibition makes criminals of millions of otherwise law-abiding citizens particularly the most marginalized and vulnerable because of these laws I am a criminal and I have been committing criminal acts for over 40 years and I suppose in my more optimistic moments and as a an ABC tragic I actually really look forward to that time where on a Friday evening I can put my feet up put on gardening Australia and I'll see Costa talking about how we can best prune our own cannabis plants to get that good crop
sw41ftdu2zo,Legalities of Smoking or Vaping Medicinal Cannabis In Public (Australia),2022-01-16T23:13:52Z,hi my name's david holbern i've just retired after 21 years as a magistrate and now i practice law i've dedicated most of my time now to the cause of medicinal cannabis today i'm going to answer a few questions that medicinal cannabis patients have asked about consumption of medicinal cannabis in public so is it legal to consume my medicinal cannabis in public in order to answer that question we need to look at cannabis medicine from two major delivery methods firstly inhalable products things like flour and hash and secondly oral products those that are consumed in the same way that most conventional medicines are consumed these are things like oils chews capsules and the like we often hear the question can i smoke my medicinal cannabis in public we've heard that patients have been told it's okay to consume their flour in smoking areas and to stay away from children but what does the law actually say there are a few things i'd like to clarify firstly the tga website explicitly states quote a variety of products are currently available these include raw botanical cannabis for which medicinal purposes should be vaporized but not smoked end quote so it's not legal for you to smoke medicinal cannabis in public at all then we must look at the question as to whether you can vaporize your medicinal cannabis in public places firstly let's deal with non-smoking areas like public transport or where there are signs prohibiting smoking in every state or territory it's illegal to vape in a non-smoking area then let's talk about smoking areas and this is a grey area there don't seem to be any laws that say you can't vape from this medicinal cannabis in public smoking areas but is still subject to the general law law enforcement still has powers to stop you from vaporizing your medication in public smoking areas for example if they deem you to be a nuisance or causing a public disturbance so in theory you could be arrested or have your medication taken away let's use an example to demonstrate these issues if you're vaping in a public area with people around a smoking area a person could complain of a public disturbance and a police officer could tell you you're not allowed to vape around other people in the same sense that passive smoking of tobacco can be harmful the passive inhalation of thc vapors could also constitute a risk to persons who are nearby although you're vaping dissipates faster than smoke from a cigarette it still has physical presence and could be deemed a public nuisance or disturbance in this scenario you might argue you're a legal patient you're medicating you're not hurting anyone and will not stop in which case you would risk arrest under those broad public disturbance powers because the law is so unclear even in a smoking area we recommend logic prevail if you need to medicate in public in a smoking area do so discreetly and make sure you stay away from children it's not good for anyone when medicinal cannabis patients have run-ins with the police now let's talk about orally consumed medicinal cannabis products with oral products the answer is simple like all other medications you can can consume an oral product in public remember the police still have powers to stop you from doing this however it seems unlikely you'd have any issues with a police officer if you're taking a tablet or a capsule in public so to conclude there are no laws that explicitly state you may not consume your cannabis medicine in public except if it is a non-smoking area if you're taking an oil product then the risk of having any trouble with law enforcement is very low if you're prescribed an inhaled product then you may only vaporize that product not smoke it and when it comes to consuming an inhaled product in public while you may get away with it as a legal practitioner i have to advise you not to vape in public and certainly not in a no-smoking area certainly not also in circumstances likely to risk a public disturbance and if a police officer or someone asks you to stop do what you're asked so you don't have legal trouble thanks for joining me today my name is david halpern and i'm signing out
dc98bhbtzao,How to Hop onto the Medical Cannabis Program in Australia 🇦🇺 (The Price has increased $100),2022-04-22T00:16:39Z,g'day all you stoners and australian stoners everybody's always commenting how do i help on the medical well in the description below access.cannatrek.com follow the link sign up to become patient they will call you you wait for the evaluator to call you you explain to the evaluator just like you typed in to sign up to become a patient why you deserve the medical cannabis then the availab evaluator will say yes or no and then the evaluator will refer you to a third party doctor and then the doctor will call you after you make the appointment so pretty much everybody calls you you don't have to seek anyone all you have to do is sign up to the link and everyone will call you however the tga is backed up with 200 plus applications as they're full as full as can be however i almost don't want to recommend this but unfortunately the cannabis um initial consultation fees have risen i used to pay 150 for an an initial consultation fee they now cost 250 so expect to pay 250 just to talk to the doctor for two prescriptions or potentially one however your follow-up fee if you go to the cda.com any prescriptions you've already been prescribed you can go through to the cda.com cannabis doctors australia and then pay 50 for a renewal of one prescription however the second consultation fees have now gone up from 75 to 175 so that's a yikes from me i only had to pay 75 because the prior people who hopped on for that price including myself and anyone else through the people that i go through at the moment i only have to pay 75 but i feel for everyone who has to pay that extra 175 or that extra 100 because i used to pay 150 and now it costs 250 to just talk to the doctor for the first time the first time so it's just interesting because you might i'm not going to say you're going to get denied but what if the doctor says you don't deserve this and you pay the 250 anyway so keep that in mind the price has now gone up from 150 for the initial consultation initial consultation means the first time that you chat to face with the doctor or phone to phone rather rather because the doctor will call you so keep that in mind it's now cost as much as a bush ounce to talk to a doctor so 250 dollars used to get you 28 grams of bush cannabis now it just gets you a consultation fee with the doctor to access medical cannabis so that that's not you don't pay for your weed that she will give you your prescription so your prescription will come from that 250 or she might say no and you might not get any prescriptions bong on keep that in mind and everybody deserves to have medical access sorry deserves to have access to medical cannabis however the prices have gone up so i used to recommend everyone to hop on now i'm hesitant to recommend it because the price has gone up by a hundred dollars it's not worth it now used to be worth 150 to just talk to the doctor that's not too bad 150 okay it was expensive but it's not that bad compared to 250 dollars just to talk to the doctor for your first consultation that's insane 250 dollars that's almost the cost of two prescriptions of cannabis so 150 dollars for 10 grams of cannabis i pay 155 for the topaz flour or i pay 155 for 3 grams of the topaz bubble hash now the bubble hash and the topaz flour 100 off both of those items goes straight to the government i wonder why it's not focusing anyway i'm going to end the video because it's not focusing you get my point the medical's risen in price bong on hop on the medical but the price is driven risen
K6ARWPxP7U4,Could cannabis be legalised in Australia?,2023-02-08T00:36:33Z,
NSYEn61CM4Q,Medicinal marijuana to be grown in Australia,2015-10-17T21:27:08Z,welcome back to weekend sunrise the federal government has today announced a plan to allow decontrolled cultivation of marijuana for medical purposes across Australia Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will seek parliamentary support for draft amendments to the narcotics Act it would allow cannabis to be grown in a safe and legal manner joining us in our Canberra studio is health minister Susan Leigh good morning to you Minister may come as a surprise to many what sparked the move and how will it work well the stories of so many patients and their suffering their inability to get pain relief a group of children with a type of epilepsy for whom it's been demonstrated that medicinal cannabis does work all of those stories have moved all of us across the country to take the steps that we are the Commonwealth is providing the missing legislative piece because currently if any state or territory cultivates cannabis for medicinal purposes they're in breach of our international conventions so we are drafting amendments to our narcotics drugs act in order that this process not be in breach of international conventions and that those who want to manufacture a product and bring it to patients can do so so Minister for years state and federal governments have said well we're not convinced to the therapeutic benefits of cannabis or cannabis extracts you obviously are convinced of that is a have you stipulated the range of illnesses for which it may be used we won't be doing that the states are conducting clinical trials and remember as a patient all of these treatments should be taken with your doctor at the centre of your treatment program and at the moment you can in fact important it's happening cannabinoids it's a typically a tincture or oil that is ingested it's very expensive it's very difficult to obtain the demand in the places where it's produced overseas is so high anyway the missing piece that we're going to provide at federal level is the ability for that cultivation to happen and then special access will be available for example for terminally ill patients who can't wait for a process that tests something that would normally go through our therapeutic goods agency that agency will still be part of this process but I want to emphasize that special access scheme for those who will be in urgent need and one of the things you have emphasized 10 Minister is that you'll be closely managing their supply of medicinal cannabis from farm to pharmacy how can you track that and make sure that the cannabis is being grown and used for the purposes that you intend well by licensing its growth inside the Department of Health in the same way that we do actually with opium poppies typically grown in Tasmania we will under our international obligations have to identify what crops are grown and what the fate of those crops is so it will be closely managed as you say from farm to pharmacy in order that there be a safe and sustainable supply of medicinal cannabis for patients as soon as possible Minister whenever we discuss this we get a lot of feedback from our viewers so just to be very clear are we talking about legalizing for medicinal purposes only cannabinoid products or will people suffering from certain ailments actually be able to smoke pot well that's not the intention this is not a product that is smoked this is not about somebody saying I'm smoking and illegal product is it it often is in some circumstances because I have an illness it's not about that at all this is carefully controlled carefully managed and it is a product as I said that is typically ingested we will see through our clinical trials what works best it's not for us to say that at this stage but it is important that the people who are undergoing pain that cannot be relieved by other circumstances and whose doctors believe that this will help get access yeah Minister what was the tipping point for this as you said before it kind of came out of nowhere no is expecting this legislation to be put forward was there a particular case or particularly compelling argument that give it this was the right thing to do it's been discussed for a long time edweena it's not something that has just suddenly come up but I guess in turning my attention to it and talking to my departmental officials my question was what do we need to do because we keep coming up against these international conventions so we need to amend the Act to allow this to take place already the states and I particularly want to commend New South Wales so I'm meeting at Westmead Hospital later this morning you know they've started clinical trials they're absolutely ready to go as our other states because they've been approached by their patients by their doctors by their cancer communities by children with epilepsy and their carers so they're ready to go and what we needed the Commonwealth to do was to provide this missing piece to actually allow this to happen without this amendment to our act this actually can't take place well Minister we know as I say from our previous discussions on the show that there will be tens of thousands of people who are incredibly grateful that the government has been listening and and monitoring the research and is going down this path so you can see how it plays out legislatively thank you for joining us this morning thank you

uncertain terms it funded on about the evils of the demon weed that mind-destroying drug marijuana naturally enough hip youngsters thought it was hilarious they still do but as it turns out reefer madness is no laughing matter it really does exist wait till you see the latest the most comprehensive research it proves cannabis really can cause psychosis can wreck young brains not only that the drug itself is stronger super strong and the users are younger much younger 10 and 11 years old [Music] dope weed pot call it what you want but smoking cannabis has been considered a rite of passage for generations but that might have to change because this drug is much stronger and more dangerous than ever before if the concentrations of cannabis continue to rise and the availability of cannabis is how it is it will definitely have a bigger impact than cocaine or heroin absolutely this drug can permanently damage brains yeah that i see all the time is there a link between this drug and suicide oh yes 21 year old lachlan priest has everything to live for he's smart sporty and popular but three years ago his life turned to hell cannabis sent lachlan mad how often would you smoke towards the end it was pretty much every day how many times a day you know two or three joints a day [Music] towards the end of 2002 the dope started altering lachlan's mental state he was becoming manic and delusional suffering from cannabis psychosis i felt that like everything was just so easy and i could conquer incredible goals which and i'll just do it like that and then one day in his bedroom lachlan snapped launching himself into a three-day psychotic bender that would end in a psychiatric ward i was starting a new life for myself so i had to um you know just everything had to go everything all the old stuff the you know i just wanted to completely live in the moment and the past just didn't matter so i destroyed it all and um and yeah smash this mirror and you know blood everywhere and that's when my parents came in and saw that i'm just standing here and rooms completely you know completely trashed looks like a bombs hit it and there's just blood everywhere and blood dripping out of my hand and they came in and i was actually in such a good mood that i was smiling it's a tiny room but it took me 12 hours to clean it up he'd done so much damage and just washing the blood off the walls and things like that was just um heart-wrenching for me and i just thought you know our lives had been turned upside down you must have felt as though you were losing your son yeah it did seem um for a while like you know yeah you do panic and you're just just wondering you know what's where's he gone because you couldn't get to it i basically just started didn't know where i was walking but i just started walking in the direction of the sun [Music] when you're kind of manic and you're at that point in psychosis um you just believe that something will come up you go outside and you go i'm just gonna walk something will happen i don't know what yet for some reason i thought that there was going to be this massive massive party being held for me at rod lake arena i walked to rod laver arena i think and [Music] just kept walking and kept walking and then i got sidetracked and went to the era [Music] um i could see footsteps just stepping in the ground next to me and even though no one was there but i i of course just thought there was you know there was someone there it's stuff like that you definitely know it's psychosis we were trolling the streets looking for him in the dark because we didn't know where he was and um i just saw him in the middle of really busy road near us just playing chicken with the traffic and i look back on those things thinking at any point during that 24 hours he could have easily died you have no doubt that marijuana played a major role in your psychosis yeah yeah definitely no doubt at all [Music] [Applause] it's now clear that what was once considered a socially acceptable drug is anything but and it's research that's taking place here in sweden that shows just how dangerous cannabis can be we're now being told that teenagers in particular are not only at real risk of a psychiatric illness but the cannabis can damage their brain for life [Music] we have two hemispheres of the brain and cannabis has an effect all over the brain because the receptors where cannabis binds to are located throughout here our cortex our cerebellum for motor coordination professor yasmin heard from sweden's karolinska institute is one of the world's leading brain researchers she has discovered cannabis can have a profound and lasting impact on the developing teenage brain early cannabis exposure changes the chemical makeup of the brain and therefore how it processes information and those brain regions that it's changed in are very important for emotional processing and for the underlying disorders related to psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia drug addiction you say the scientific data is there to show that there is a direct link between cannabis and psychosis definitely um there are studies now worldwide that have shown this the earlier you use cannabis and kids now are using it earlier and earlier the greater the effect on the brain so it's cannabis with development how young are we talking here you have kids starting at 10 11 years old the adolescent brain is particularly vulnerable as it matures indicated here in blue it becomes hardwired cannabis can disturb the chemical balance of the brain causing psychosis [Music] with the skunk which is 30 to 60 times higher in thc content than the ordinary block or the stuff that was around in the 60s people are really hurting their brains particularly particularly the young people whose brains aren't properly formed yet julie lynn evans is a london-based psychotherapist who is at the front line of what she calls a losing battle more and more young patients are being sent to her with cannabis related psychosis and this is what they've been smoking it's called skunk the most potent form of cannabis loaded with thc the component of the drug that gets you high it's regarded by a growing number of experts as the most dangerous drug on the streets today i would prefer to have a 18 year old hooked on heroin to treat or crack cocaine and skunk that's an extraordinary thing to say yes i know very controversial that you'd prefer a young person to be hooked on heroin well as long as they're smoking it i think once you go into needles that's a different ball game [Music] so you don't recover from a percentage of children and we don't know what percentage yet and it's a small percentage but because of i work on the edge and as a percentage i see don't recover and there's nothing that you can do about them lachlan priests first tried pot at 15 but only smoked it heavily in his final year of school within six months he was delusional and i started thinking i could you know become invisible and that's you know that's that's when people would you know look you and go man like something's not right like when you start having because it it just you kind of elevate and elevate [Music] so i ended up escaping from hospital invisibly of course that's when i started seeing all the auras and i started thinking i was it was initiation into into heaven i guess [Applause] [Music] it's party time in amsterdam the liberal capital of the western world here just about anything goes cannabis is freely available to be bought and smoked as long as you're over 18 of course oh that could make me happy so it's no surprise that it's in this town you'll find the drug's strongest defenders without hyperbole it's the single most important plant in human history it's the first thing we cultivated as a crop it was the first thing we wove into a cloth and wore on our back that wasn't an animal skin it was the only thing strong enough to make paper that would last several generations it's the only thing strong enough to rig a ship to sell around the world so it's it's had these places in these fundamental parts of our development this is a female flower of the super skunk plants ken johnson runs amsterdam seed bank a mecca for cannabis connoisseurs here you can buy the high you want the steady trade ample evidence that tourists don't come here just for the tubes there's no such thing as a safe drug uh sugar isn't it and caffeine aren't safe drugs correct me if i'm wrong but i think we're yet to see a sugar user having a psychotic episode as a direct result well so we see psychotic episode the terminology is often very misapplied a psychotic symptom a psychotic episode and not the same thing as a psychosis which is not the same thing as a schizophrenia and as far as science or medicine having decided that cannabis is linked to these things the it's extremely flimsy evidence this is a prime example of a cannabis indica variety it's actually a hindu kush cross with skunk number one we call it the pot of gold um now these originate from colder more mountainous regions other champions of cannabis like lorna clay who runs an information service about the drug point to its medicinal properties it can be used to treat the symptoms of anything from aids to arthritis medically this is used to treat people who have glaucoma multiple sclerosis chronic pain even arthritis but even lorna expresses concern about the potential effects of cannabis on teenagers do you think young people should be smoking marijuana no i don't at all um that's also to do with the fact that when you're young your brain is not fully matured until you're 18 to 21 years old there is definitely evidence out there in many studies now worldwide to show a link between cannabis and especially i want to emphasize early cannabis exposure and schizophrenia [Music] if you needed further proof illustrating the potentially lethal mix of teenagers and cannabis it can be found here in professor heard's lab young rats exposed to cannabis developed an appetite for other drugs it's called the gateway theory we did an animal study where we gave cannabis during the adolescent period and then studied them as adults and the group of rats that had gotten thc the active component of cannabis as teenagers they took more heroin as adults so clearly there was a gateway effect on the neurobiological level it had nothing to do with their friends their parents their genetics [Music] of course humans aren't rats but we are talking about the vulnerability of our teenagers to an insidious drug for lachlan it took a good 18 months of therapy at melbourne's origin center for adolescent health and the support of family and friends to help him get back his life why do you choose to speak out um i choose to speak out because i think there's a real lack of communication about it in terms of marijuana and in terms of the link to mental illness what impact has this had upon your life um it's had a huge huge impact um i think i think if if anything it's made me a lot stronger you survived yeah i did survive not everyone

fRrpcJpdmsc,30% THC: Under 1% CBD Indica - From Criminal To Patient In Australia Part 2,2021-07-11T06:15:12Z,"this video is not sponsored by or affiliated witn any clinic seen within  from criminal to patient i'm going to start again hey i'm christy from plant magic and craze collective  in one of our recent videos we showed you how far medicinal cannabis has come here in Australia   today i'll be answering some of the most common questions people still have   now, medicinal cannabis is available to all Australian's who can afford the associated fees, with 92 percent of cannabis arrest targeting the consumer over the supplier a prescription is essential for any consumer wanted to avoid prosecution for posession since our last video the costs associated with prescriptions have changed  this chart shows some of the available medications and their price points over recent months we'll be looking at price points from march 2020 november 2020 and march 2021  so as you can see through this chart medicinal cannabis is available in a range of different products   such as flower, sprays, lozenges, capsules and oils prices have been dropping.. uh looking at t20 flower through cannatrek, March 2020 it was $225, November it was down to $105 a drop of $7.50 per gram over an eight month period   the cost of medication itself is not the only thing to come 
down in price with more cannabis clinics entering the market application fees have also seen a reduction a quick google search reveals charts such as this one by honahlee, providing an easy price comparison option  although we have seen a reduction in costs the average spend for a patient is still unattainable for those who need it most   in our previous video we documented the struggle 
you may face when speaking with old-fashioned gp's   a lot of cannabis clinics are now offering 
internal referral options to avoid this added stress  so today we'll be reviewing aussie grown 
rocky which is a 30 thc less than one percent cbd indica flower  antg rocky is a fairly new product 
and one of the higher thc strains on the market   most prescriptions are 
fulfilled by registered post   this order was sent to new south wales 
from a terry white chemist in victoria all right so let's see what we have here   understanding medicinal cannabis 
a guide to starting your medicinal cannabis treatment  this information booklet 
is for patients prescribed medicinal cannabis our products here, okay so  we have, 10 grams of cannabis dried flour. so 
as mentioned before 30 thc and under 0.1 cbd also, an oil solution so this is from tilray which 
is 25 mg thc 25 mg cbd which is an oil solution it's 40 milligrams and it's 
carrier oil is mct coconut oil so this medication was purchased 
in january 2021  the cost for the antg rocky was $250 for 10 grams and for 
the tilray thc cbd oral oil it was $280   for 40 mls? 40 mls. so with direction here it says to use 0.1 grams 
three times a day as directed by your doctor  this is for the antg rocky indica flower for
the oil it's suggested to use   0.25mls twice a day as directed by 
your doctor and that's for the thc and cbd oil so it's came with a seal for protection 
and i'm just going to open it this way yeah   a lot of dust on the top that smells really lemony all right we'll pull out some buds so we can 
pull them apart have a look on the inside so you can see all the trichomes 
in there it's a lot more than on the outside you can see the trichomes 
as well flying everywhere it's very dry so it's a bit hard to break apart a little bit but it's got a lot of trichomes 
on the inside of each bud so for first impression it smells   quite lemony.. you can see the trichomes on the 
actual flower buds themselves  and there's not  as many hairs as normal which is normally a 
good sign as well for my understanding anyway so it seems to me a lot of small buds rather 
than a lot of bigger buds   there's not a lot of stems from what i can see here  and there is a lot of trichomes on these flowers so you can it from quite a distance so you can see the trichomes 
falling off as i'm breaking it apart   and along with it being all on 
my gloves as i'm playing with it but there is a lot of trichomes on 
the inside as well.. it is frosty as   so looking at the bud you can see that there 
is..  it's still got quite a bit of sugar leaves   on it which is just these things here that 
could be trimmed a little bit better but,   it's packed full of trichomes so even with the 
sugar leaves it's covered in trichomes it's fine as you can see all the tricom's there 
along with it on my gloves and falling off this is very good quality but there is a lot 
more little buds than there are larger buds so   the two buds that i've pulled apart are the 
only two buds that are quite big in there but yeah lots of tricones a lot more 
trichomes obviously on the inside you can see the trichomes falling off it or 
something like it's very  it's quite powdery for it being so solid this is chronic as F"
QkSnuUu4cY8,Five Things Medical Marijuana Won&#39;t Tell You | Medical Marijana,2013-08-12T14:24:23Z,20 states and the District of Columbia now have laws on their books that permit the use of medicinal marijuana that's a lot a lot of weed a lot of money and a lot of assumptions about this booming business many of which may be a little off base hi I'm Jim JAL trade market watch and we've taken a look at some of the popular myths and misconceptions surrounding medicinal marijuana and come up with a list we've called 10 things medical marijuana won't tell you here are 5 number one this is a bonanza business it's like growing money not true what is true is that a pound of pharmaceutical grade marijuana costs about a thousand dollars to produce and fetches about seven thousand five hundred dollars at your local dispensary that's a huge markup and the medical marijuana business daily of Rhode Island projects sales nationwide can hit three billion dollars by next year at the same time it's a very risky business bear in mind that regardless of what the states have ruled marijuana is still illegal under federal law that means that feds still have the right to raid medicinal marijuana dispensaries seize their assets and shut them down knowing this banks credit card companies and other traditional avenues of Commerce are extremely reluctant to have anything to do with them and that pushes up the cost of doing business number two you're not gonna hear the dispensaries sarcastically wish you good luck getting a prescription while it might not be harder to in Venice Beach California try getting your average physician to write you a prescription for weed according to Marijuana doctors comm only one maybe two of every 500 doctors are willing to write a prescription for medicinal marijuana in fact it's not even called a prescription it's a federally banned substance so so far it's being called a recommendation number three this one goes back to the public you're not gonna hear patients claim they need marijuana because they really need to get loaded now it's all about while research shows marijuana can be very effective in relieving the symptoms of AIDS cancer multiple sclerosis and glaucoma marijuana is usually recommended to treat other chronic conditions especially pain and pain is hard to measure which means that a lot of patients claiming to be in pain might just be recreational smokers in Colorado for example 94% of those approved to use medical marijuana report they're being treated for pain only 3% take it for cancer and only 1% for glaucoma number four another thing you're not going to hear at the dispensary the THC brownies may be stronger than they appear that's because as with any business these guys have competition they're constantly trying to cultivate better more potent strains of cannabis and they're pretty good at it the stuff being sold today has ridiculously high levels of THC compared with the stuff in circulation four years ago and since it's illegal at the federal level the quality and the strength of the product are totally unregulated finally number five no marijuana shop owner is going to tell you that you're really not being overly paranoid they are after your money remember credit card companies won't do business with these guys that means it's primarily a cash and carry business and with the amount of cash flowing through these shops they're fat targets for robbery often armed robbery at the same time early studies show that areas that have a high concentration of dispensaries do not correlate with higher rates of crime bars for example are more likely to bump up in neighborhoods crime rate there is however concern that patients visiting the dispensaries could become easy targets but the data is just not there yet
CWIqBb24py8,Medicinal Cannabis in Australia | Azure Medical Complete Health Series,2021-11-16T23:52:28Z,good evening welcome to my first live posting i'm aparna hegde i work at azure medical as a general practitioner i'm a uwa graduate from long time i won't say how long and i've been interested and prescribing medicinal cannabis for the past five years i'd love to tell you all about you as a western australian how to access it if it's right for you and basically a little bit about the background as well and why it is so much of a topical subject these days so medicinal cannabis is only new in australia but it has been around for 50 or so years elsewhere and it has been used in a research as well as therapeutic fashion for that time the issues in the western world and particularly in australia is there's a lot of stigma associated with cannabis and in particular the word marijuana was brought in in the 50s during prohibition times to stigmatize it make it sound more mexican and therefore foreign so i like to use the word medicinal cannabis because it is essentially descriptive of what it is so the government in australia regulates two different components to the actual medicinal cannabis however being a plant-based product there's actually over 400 different compounds that include terpenes flavonoids cbg cbd and the thc which is the psychoactive or the component in cannabis that gives you the high so the government's only interested in regulating the two components which is cbd cannabidiol and tetrahydrocannabinol which is the thc the medicinal cannabis seen in australia has exploded but as yet there's only two registered products on the market uh one is a gmo produced cbd and the other is a navigable which is a thc so all the other products are not registered on the australian market and therefore there's a lot of paperwork involved to try and bring them to the patient and how that goes is cbd being a non-psychoactive part of medicinal cannabis is a schedule for medication which means that there's less paperwork to do essentially and thc being a psychoactive part has more paperwork involved and is a schedule eight substance it just means the legislation that applies to them is different so if a substance is set schedule 8 and contains thc there's an issue with taking it and driving but there'd be an issue with taking any type of psychoactive medication and driving so we wouldn't want you to for example take panadeine fort which is the codeine based medication and drive because it has problems um with making you sleepy and making you more sedated same deal with the thc part so now that i've gone through the the regulations and the paperwork what is it used for essentially cannabidiol which is cbd non-psychoactive but has a lot of therapeutic properties so it doesn't give you a high but it's used for pain relief and particularly in inflammatory conditions such as fibromyalgia osteoarthritis any type of chronic pain migraine headaches that are chronic and being non-psychoactive you can take it and drive it doesn't come up on drug testing i've had several fifo patients that take it and they've been tested while they've been on site it doesn't come up as positive at all the way the cbd works is it binds to the endocannabinoid receptors in the cells in university i was never actually taught about the endocannabinoid system but it's actually a receptor that's found in every single cell in the body and it gives you the high that you get when you exercise for example we make our own cannabinoids in the body and with that if you're depleted in some way it can lead to anxiety or low mood so cbd is quite often used to address those issues as well it's been used a lot for the behavioral issues such as attention deficit disorder and autism spectrum disorder mainly because it does alleviate a lot of that anxiety and the hyper vigilance that happens in their brains what else is it used for it's been used for reproductive disorders very strong premenstrual dysphoric symptoms pain during menstrual cycle menopause symptoms because it does have an overarching holistic wellness to it so as far as the cbd is concerned very very safe to take the only real side effects you get is if it's in an oil you can get a bit of loose bowel movements because it is an oil that the carrier is placed in might have difficulty digesting it the way the oil is taken is it's taken under the tongue and held for 30 to 60 seconds before swallowing on an empty stomach that mitigates the effect of having the loose bowel movements so the other side effect that it can have is that because it's metabolized by the liver you may get a hold up or a problem with metabolizing other medications that are metabolized through the liver so it's always worthwhile making sure that the liver functions are monitored when any type of medicinal cannabis is being used therapeutically so in terms of the cbd another use for it is the movement disorders so in children high doses have been used for seizures and to decrease the incidence of seizures in seizure disorders it's also been used in adults for degenerative conditions such as parkinson's that cause a lot of tremor or rigidity multiple sclerosis for the pain and the fatigue as well as the movement the spasticity that can be involved there as well so lots of different applications and the beauty of cbd as i said before is it's a non-psychoactive component to the medicinal cannabis very safe to take it's even been used in very high doses in children so let's talk about the more exciting and psychoactive component of medicinal cannabis which is more regulated and schedule eight the thc part the products that are available these days are range in different concentrations of thc and cbd anything that contains a more than a one percent in total component of thc is considered to be a thc medication so how does the thc work it's primarily distributed the receptors in the brain and there are receptors all through the body as well but it works in a different fashion to the cbd it still works on pain relief still works on decreasing anxiety still works on helping promote wellness however it can as i said have cognitive impact it can be sedating some sometimes we want that you know side effects because it's used for insomnia what is it primarily used for therapeutically it's primarily used for anxiety and panic attack migraines and acute onset pain chronic pain because it's a great pain medication the beauty of thc is that you don't need as the body goes and gets used to it more and more of this drug to achieve the same result which is called tachyphylaxis as you get with the opiate medications that are commonly alternatives for pain pain relief and pain medications that are more commonly used so i i really really dislike opiates and most people do in my own pain relief because i feel like it makes me sleepy but doesn't actually give me good pain relief whereas with things like the thc based medication there's a fine line obviously between getting cognitive effects and being impaired or being high and the pain relief so a dose titration is used for that but in terms of anxiety there's also an effect on decreasing anxiety and primarily that's why we use it um at night time for people who have anxiety that impairs their ability to sleep so as far as the process is concerned to get access to medicinal cannabis it's more and more open these days your gp can actually go through the system and prescribe the medication to you some are not comfortable because as with anything new you have to be familiar and gain experience with the whole process and quite frankly it is still a lot of paperwork and hassle so the access has improved there are clinics these days that are based solely on dispensing and prescribing medicinal cannabis there are gps that only do this particular field as well and the legislation in wa is such that you don't have to have anything other than the accreditation in order to prescribe it so there is a difference between an authorized prescriber as far as doctors are concerned and a non-authorised prescriber so any gp is a non-authorised prescriber and the ones that are authorized have to go through a process of being able to get the approval through the therapeutic goods administration this is tga as well as the department of health in in wa to prescribe the medications these days it's a lot easier to become an authorized prescriber so i have a question about how much the process costs the costs have actually come down a lot since the very beginning when i started prescribing about five years ago it was a lot more expensive and because there's less of a monopoly and more and more medications that are available the process has become far more simple as well as less expensive so it depends on the product in terms of the cost in general there are different ways of accessing it what what we do in azure is charge the standard console price in terms of coming in the best thing is obviously for the patient to bring all their specialist letters so that it makes the time in terms of the initial consult and follow-up far less involved and the the cost is time-based we're not about billing clinic so it's dependent on whether it's a less than 20 minutes or more than 20 minute consult the product the pharmacy will charge for a 50 ml bottle of oil about 300 and the 50 ml would probably last you for 50 days so that's pretty much how it ranges but there are now wafers oils there's even the flour that can be vaporized so the cost varies dependent on the products so in terms of the legalities behind medicinal cannabis and working on a job that does drug testing so as i mentioned before the cbd product which doesn't contain the thc is actually um safe to use and there's actually there's no psychoactive in it so it doesn't come up as positive with the drug testing for thc as far as the thc is concerned it depends on the individual and the organization that they work for if they're in a safety critical role in general the thc use would not be allowed and you know if they were in a non-safety critical role the organization would need a letter and indication for what the drug was being taken usually the occupational physician that's in charge of the organization reviews that letter asks some questions as to you know how long the person's been on it what the prognosis is how long would the person want to be taking it and what would be the downtime so with thc how long it lasts in the body and how how long it affects the body in terms of the possible cognitive effects is about six to eight hours so it works well if the person is taking it to go to sleep so the following day it's really not impairing the person it may however show up on drug testing well after the person has taken it mainly because with regular use it can go into the fat and it can come out in urine drug testing even though it may not be causing an impact on the pharmacology of the person so in terms of how you can go about getting more information so there's a number of different websites these days and i tend to basically use little green pharma which has a great range of literature and case studies as well as testimonials to direct patients to go and gain more information i also tend to use another organization that has a good website called green lab and it's a more independent not based on one particular company website and obviously when you look at worldwide literature and research canada and israel probably are the countries that have the most experience in therapeutic use of the medication and therefore have the most evidence based in australia there's a lot of studies being done ongoing a little green farmer company i've previously mentioned uh has a study that's ongoing at the moment that's collaborating with university of sydney and is subsidizing the cost of the some of their products for people that want to trial it it's a quality of life study so it's a subjective rather than an objective study and with that study the aim is to recruit 50 000 people and follow them up for at least two years and see what impact the use of medicinal cannabis has on different quality of life parameters so how can we help in terms of making it less of an issue for access in australia we can lobby our government both federal as well as local especially on the rules for driving and the use of medicinal cannabis in tasmania it's now legal to use the thc medication provided the person's been assessed and been shown not to have an impairment on their driving i had a question about the study taking on people now yes it's australia-wide and the study is still recruiting people the intent is to go to 50 000 people and they've got to around halfway so if you do want to enroll all you have to do is actually google quest and it will come up with an online questionnaire of whether you would be suitable to enroll in the quest and it will also come up with a link for different gps or practitioners that are actually involved with the quest trial and you could also go ahead and book into someone that's closest to you so in going forward as i said i would like to see all of us open our mind and use medicinal cannabis without the stigma that's associated with marijuana or an illegal substance it is perfectly legal when it's prescribed it also needs other people to come on board and destigmatize the whole issue we're not in the 1950s anymore we're far ahead of that and i believe it's not for everybody but for those that it does work for it is life changing and we need to keep an open mind we need to also encourage people to try something especially when it's something like cbd which has absolutely no cognitive effects whatsoever but a lot of potential benefits with very little side effects and risks being a plant-based product it is also something that has fewer effects and as most people say they do want to try more natural things this is definitely one of those and in destigmatizing opening it up it's treated just like another medication and if it's suitable then it's prescribed there's none of this sort of worry and weight and paperwork involved so i'd like to see a time where more people bring it on and are open to using it and it's just like another blood pressure medication if it suits you then you can go on it so i believe that's um probably where i will leave it we will hopefully get live again if there's any follow-on questions and i will answer those in the future so thanks everyone and i will finish off now
