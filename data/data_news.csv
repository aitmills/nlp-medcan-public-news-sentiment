Victoria’s cannabis laws are causing countless chronically ill people to instead take addictive prescription medications, a doctor has warned.  It comes amid proposed new laws for the state which would allow to users to drive with the drug detectable in their system.  The bill was introduced to the upper house on Wednesday by members of the Legalise Cannabis Party which nabbed two seats at the last election.  Among the changes to the Road Safety act would include it no longer being an offence for otherwise unimpaired drivers to have detectable tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in their blood or oral fluid. TCH is the primary psychoactive substance from cannabis.  Dr Karen Hitchcock, who works as a GP specialising in medicinal cannabis, said Victoria’s current laws were pushing patients towards other prescription drugs.  “I am referred patients with insomnia, often to assist them to withdraw from addictive drugs with overdose potential – benzodiazepines such as valium and temazepam, opiates, antipsychotics such as quetiapine, and hypnotics,” she said. Dr Hitchcock said a dose of cannabis oil before bed is “often all that is required” to treat symptoms but this can stay in a driver’s system after “the effects of the cannabis have long abated”. “Unfortunately by morning, the patient may still have traces of THC in their saliva, and it may be detected in their blood for weeks,” she said.  “Many patients choose to stay on their more dangerous and more addictive medications because of the driving laws. Others take a risk, as the relief and increase in quality of life now that they are sleeping soundly are worth the risk of losing their licence.  Dr Hitchcock went on to say the current laws could cause pain-stricken drivers to become a danger on the roads due to a lack of sleep. “Sleep deprivation, we know, grossly impairs driving ability. It is time the laws were changed to reflect the reality that cannabis is a medicine,” she said. “It is time we stopped mistaking innocent citizens for criminals”. Legalise Cannabis Victoria MP David Ettershank, who represents the Western Metropolitan region, said the laws should be focused on impairment, not just THC being present.  “People who have been prescribed a medicine and can drive safely should be allowed to drive – this is how we treat every single prescription medicine in Victoria, except medicinal cannabis, and it’s time for that to be corrected,” he said. “Testing for the sheer presence of THC rather than impairment is not right. This failure is based on stigma rather than evidence and the law for cannabis needs to be brought in line with all other prescription medicines.” Currently, Tasmania is the only state which provides a medical defence for driving with the presence of THC in bodily fluids.  This is only applicable if the medicinal cannabis is obtained and administered in accordance with state laws. In response to a Bill on the issue in 2019, the Victorian government established the Medicinal Cannabis and Safe Driving Working Group and commissioned research into its potential impact.  A search is currently underway in a state’s high country, where an Irish hiker has reportedly been missing for days.

When the NSW Police Traffic and Highway Patrol Command posted details of their latest roadside bust on Facebook, they didn’t predict the flood of criticism that would come their way. Hundreds of Australians commented on Thursday’s post, which stated that a 21-year-old woman was arrested in the southwestern Sydney suburb of Oran Park after testing positive to a medically prescribed cannabis, questioning if it’s a joke and calling it “whack”.  Police wrote: “The driver was questioned about her cannabis use and informed police she had been prescribed the drug for pain management ‘so it’s allowed’.” After testing positive on the random roadside test, she was taken to Narellan police station for a second test which also showed the presence of cannabis in her system. Her driver’s licence was suspended for 24 hours prior to being released from custody. “The saliva sample she provided has been forwarded to a laboratory for examination with the driver expected to be charged with driving with an illicit prescribed restricted substance in her system,” the police said. “Medically prescribed drugs do not automatically give drivers the right to continue driving whilst taking the prescribed medication. All prescribed medications contain warnings relating to driving whilst using them. “Please ensure that when you are prescribed a restricted medication that you read the warning labels attached that relate to driving motor vehicles.” More and more Australians are turning to medical marijuana for pain relief, and that means more are going to be affected by the confusion in the law. As many commenters pointed out, there is uncertainty over how long the medication can last in your system, leaving many at risk of falling foul of this law unintentionally.  Drivers can take medical marijuana and still test positive days later even though they are arguably not affected, with the time frame dependent on several factors including your metabolism, dose and how the medication was administered. Adding to the confusion, a study from 2009 showed cannabis could be detected for up to six days after last consumption in daily consumers, however another study found the drug may be found in a hair strand at the 90-day mark. The main psychoactive component of the cannabis plant is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Before 2016, Australian law generally considered cannabis an illegal narcotic. However, in February 2016, the Narcotics Drug Act 1967 was amended and medicinal cannabis products are available for specific patient groups under strict medical supervision.  Since then, the use of cannabis for medical reasons has skyrocketed, with data from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) finding prescriptions have doubled from 2020 to 2021, with more than 122,000 prescriptions written last year. That’s compared to 2018, where there were just 2500 prescriptions written.  Former NSW Magistrate David Heilpern has been outspoken about the flaw in the law, telling Sydney Criminal Lawyers that drivers are being horribly affected by medical cannabis rules. “It’s absolutely tragic,” Mr Heilpern said. “There is no defence for having a prescription or using medicinally, so it means that a whole range of people are caught up in these silly drug driving laws. “Most people who use cannabis medicinally use it at least once every 24 hours … So, what happens is they’re permanently driving with discernible levels of THC in their system, even though they’re not driving under the influence, in terms of being affected. “What that meant was, when I was sitting on the bench, I was taking people’s licences from them, destroying their lives, making them lose their employment, lose their houses and it was affecting their relationships. “If people are apprehended, and if people have a detectable level of THC in their system, then they should be able to show their medical certificate and have a defence.” Hundreds of Australians voiced their dismay about the arrest on the NSW Police post.  One commenter said: “That is so wrong; fight it it’s medical.”  Another person said: “But was she affected or did you just get trace amounts? Go and look at how Tassie is doing it and step into the light as they have instead of staying in the dark ages. “Illicit yet it’s prescribed to her? Illicit if not on prescription.” Tasmania recognises medical cannabis and driving. If you have a prescription for medical cannabis and you are not driving impaired, you won’t be penalised. Another commenter pointed out: “The big problem is you can still test positive to this in your system while not being affected by the medication.” One person wrote: “You take this person’s licence but it’s OK for me to smash three beers, two codeine and a couple tapendadol and I won’t lose it? Makes sense to me.” Another said: “Bit of a rough go when many other medications and non-illicit substances cause the same effects to cognitive and motor skills, but don’t make it illegal for the patient to drive. Laws need to be amended.” And a third wrote: “Disgusting way to treat ‘select’ medicated patients! It’s time the government realised that having THC in your system does not mean you are impaired.”  Meanwhile, another commenter said: “This is ridiculous. Could be showing up 24 hours after use.” And another wrote: “Yet I can take Seroquel and drive. The laws are whack.” Drivers are being warned to be cautious in the coming days as a five-day operation begins, with motorists facing double demerits throughout.

IT’S safe to say most people think cannabis chills you out. Now researchers have discovered that perception may be stronger than the drug itself. In a large study of the effect cannabis has on pain in sufferers across Australia, the team from the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre (NDARC) uncovered some unexpected results. While they found most people “perceived it to help”, in reality, it didn’t really change their level of pain. Researchers think this might be simply because medicinal cannabis can help people sleep so their pain is more tolerable the next day. The University of New South Wales study followed 1500 people over four years to see how pain interfered with their everyday life and whether using medicinal cannabis would change their prescribed opioid use.  Worldwide interest in the area has been growing, particularly for chronic non-cancer pain. There has also been increasing speculation that using cannabis for pain may allow people to reduce their prescribed opioid. The results, published in Lancet Public Health on Tuesday, suggest that there is a need for caution given there were “no strong findings supporting a clear role for cannabis for these reasons”.  Participants who were using cannabis had greater pain and anxiety, were not coping as well with their pain, and reported that pain was interfering more in their life. They found there was no clear evidence that cannabis reduced pain severity or pain interference or led participants to reduce their opioid use or dose. NDARC director Professor Michael Farrell said medicinal cannabis had been a very hard sell and people needed to approach it with caution. “People who otherwise wouldn’t have gone near cannabis have been experimenting with it,” he said. “One of the things we think happens when people report benefits is the sleep and sedation effects it has. “Often when you get a good night’s sleep your pain is a lot more tolerable.” In what was one of the world’s longest in-depth community studies on pharmaceutical opioids and chronic non-cancer pain, participants were recruited through community pharmacies and completed comprehensive assessments of their pain, physical and mental health, medication and cannabis use annually.  They had been in pain for a median of 10 years and taken prescribed opioids for their pain for a median of four years, with “very high rates of physical and mental health problems”.  Lead author Dr Gabrielle Campbell said chronic non-cancer pain was a complex problem.  “For most people, there is unlikely to be a single effective treatment,” she said. “In our study of people living with chronic non-cancer pain who were prescribed pharmaceutical opioids, despite reporting perceived benefits from cannabis use, we found no strong evidence that cannabis use reduced participants’ pain or opioid use over time.” To join the conversation, please

VOTE IN OUR POLL The state government will investigate whether medicinal cannabis users should be allowed to drive on Queensland roads under a wide-ranging review of the state’s drug driving rules. It is currently illegal for anyone in Queensland to drive with any trace of THC – which can be found in medicinal cannabis products – regardless of whether it was prescribed or taken illegally. The Department of Transport and Main Roads (TMR) has confirmed they will now look at medicinal cannabis as part of a review that has been launched following an increase in drug driving offences. TMR’s general manager for land transport, safety and regulation, Andrew Mahon, said the government was “acutely aware” of the challenges faced by those who wanted to use medicinal cannabis and continue to drive. “However, cannabis and other drugs continue to be prohibited while driving,” he said. “Medicinal cannabis and the issues presented, such as impacts on enforcement through roadside drug testing and those wanting to continue to drive will be investigated as part of this review.” Mr Mahon said the use of medicinal cannabis and driving was a growing area of concern for road safety, but also a “very complex and difficult one to solve”. He said Queensland’s current approach to medicinal cannabis was due to THC being a psychoactive substance that can impair cognitive and motor function – increasing the risk of crashes. The review of the state’s approach to tackling drug driving will look at illegal drugs as well. A TMR spokesman said the state’s road safety action plan called for a package of drug driving reforms based on best practice, contemporary research evidence, and stakeholder consultation. “The review is in response to the growing number of drug driving offences being detected on Queensland’s roads and an increase in crashes resulting in serious injuries and lives lost,” he said. “Included in the scope of this program is a review of current approaches to deter offending through enforcement and offender management.” The review is expected to be done by the end of next year. The Greens have previously called on the government to allow medicinal cannabis users to drive on Queensland roads. In Tasmania, driving with a detectable amount of THC is an offence – unless the product was obtained and administered in accordance with the state’s Poisons Act.

An Iraq War veteran has launched a campaign pleading for subsidised medicinal cannabis, with PTSD sufferers only granted financial support for antipsychotics that bear “suicidal” effects.  The campaign, dubbed “No More Zombie Veterans”, is led by retired air force communications specialist Derek Pyrah. It is centred around a petition aimed at attracting the attention of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and Minister Matt Keogh, who took the reins for the portfolio after Labor claimed government in May.  Mr Pyrah said many veterans simply could not afford medicinal cannabis despite its proven ability to treat PTSD. It comes as calls from doctors and veterans for the DVA to review its medical policy continue to fall on deaf ears. The DVA approves cannabis for pain, albeit many pain specialists are reportedly still reluctant to prescribe the drug, and does not approve it for PTSD or any mental-health related issues. Currently, veterans are either required to build up the funds for medicinal cannabis scripts – with costs of more than $2000 per month – or turn to the black market and face possible criminal conviction and prison.  The alternative is settling for the psychotropic medication supported by the DVA, which Mr Pyrah says “have been scientifically proven to be harmful to human health, are ineffective and can lead to suicidal ideation”. He is aiming for 25,000 signatures to send a message to Mr Keogh and the DVA. The petition is currently sitting at about 17,500 signatures.  The Wollongong-based Mr Pyrah has been sending evidence-rich letters to the DVA since 2019. He said current treatment options were turning veterans into zombies, ruining family relationships and requiring years of taxpayer-funded, ongoing medical attention.  ZOMBIE VETERANS Veterans wanted support for medicinal cannabis because they felt they were overmedicated on current psychotropics, Mr Pyrah said. His own experience began in late 2003, when he returned from Iraq.  “Everyone noticed I was different when I came back,” Mr Pyrah said. “Wife, family, they were all like, ‘Who is this?’ “It’s just how it goes, you don’t realise. The high-stress environment for a long period of time with things happening now and again that sort of play with your head. “Internationally, research and scientists are finding out if you overmedicate veterans with PTSD on the psychotropic medication, it does lead to suicidal ideation, it makes them zombies. “Veterans all around the world talk about this, being zombies, and it leads to family and relationship breakups.” But the DVA “keeps pumping” veterans “full of these medications that don’t work”, Mr Pyrah said, leading to social and economic costs down the track. The air force veteran was in and out of hospital for nine years, estimating his ineffective treatment to have cost at least $1m in taxpayer money. Wives, husbands and children of PTSD-affected veterans often require “decades” of counselling, Mr Pyrah added.  “If you get family and relationship breakups, you’ve got traumatised kids,” he said. “If you’ve got an angry parent who’s a veteran with PTSD and they’re on the current medications, they’re still angry, they’re just a medicated zombie. “That affects the kids. That affects the wife, the husband.  “That’s money the government has to put out in counselling for decades for that — and that happens.” WHAT THE MEDICAL EXPERTS SAY Cannabis prescriber Dr James Stewart said a series of antipsychotic medications approved and subsidised by the DVA could give veterans the “zombie” feeling when they were using a mix of drugs to combat pain, mental-health and sleep issues.  “The (drugs) they use for mental health, that’s your standard antidepressants, but a lot of these guys have PTSD so they then go onto your antipsychotic medications, which are pretty serious,” Dr Stewart said. “They change the way a person thinks, the mood they’re in and come with side effects like weight gain, loss of libido, all these things. “The other one is your sleeping pills. They’re just a relaxant, but they also become addictive and can have a carry-over effect the next day. “On their own, they can still be pretty bad, but a lot of these guys are on a combination of all three of those because they come back, they’ve got pain, mental-health issues and they’re not sleeping well. “They’re just zombies, they’re not themselves and they can’t think.” Veterans reported significant health improvements when they were introduced to medicinal cannabis as an alternative, Dr Stewart added, with many feeling as though they had been freed from the “zombie”. “The amount of patients I’ve been able to step off opioids and antipsychotics and they’re using cannabis, everyone reports a cloud has lifted,” he said.  “A switch has been switched back on, everything’s bright again. They’re not just this zombie, dazed, glazed, walking around.” CALLS FOR CHANGE FALLING ON DEAF EARS The DVA continues to ignore calls to review its policies, medical professionals and veterans say.  Dr Stewart even offered to write the department a new policy free of charge, arguing it was “unreasonable and outdated”.  Fellow prescriber Jim Connell also joined the chorus of calls for change in a bid to support veterans who desperately need it.  But veterans continued to suffer while the DVA declined the opportunity to review its drug approval process, Dr Stewart said.  “Everyday that this goes waiting, more veterans suffer and take their life, which is so frustrating,” he said.  “I don’t know why nothing is being done.” Mr Pyrah hopes new veteran affairs Minister Matt Keough will take notice. “I’m writing more letters at the moment to ministers about this campaign and about this change needed,” he said.  “The reply I’ve had back from the DVA with all my letters over the last couple of years has pretty much been the same sentence: there’s not enough scientific evidence to support medicinal cannabis for PTSD.” WHAT THE VETERANS MINISTER SAYS Mr Keogh insists the DVA is monitoring research in the medicinal cannabis space but says he is advised there is still insufficient evidence to approve the drug for PTSD. “Ensuring our veterans have access to the most appropriate available treatments for mental and physical conditions is always important,” he told NCA NewsWire. “(But) I am advised that there is currently insufficient formal evidence to support medicinal cannabis as an effective treatment for mental health conditions, including PTSD.” He said the DVA was “actively monitoring research” despite multiple doctors and veterans claiming the department continued to ignore the evidence they presented.  “I’m aware clinical trials are beginning to see positive anecdotal evidence of the effectiveness of (cannabis) treatments for mental health conditions,” Mr Keogh said.  “I look forward to further advice following these trials.” A note containing the last words of a man found dead on a popular Sydney beach last month reveals a heartbreaking reality.

ADVOCATES of medical cannabis say it needs to be made more readily available as Australia faces warnings that we’re “sleep walking” into a prescription drug overdose crisis.   Deaths caused by pharmaceutical drugs used to treat pain, anxiety and sleeplessness are rising in Australia, prompting warning that we’re heading towards a hidden epidemic.  Manufacturers of alternative medicines say medicinal marijuana products should be made more accessible to patients as an alternative treatment in cases where opioid addiction or overuse is a concern.  “Especially when people have chronic pain conditions or cancer pain, a lot of studies have shown that medicinal cannabis is a great way to wean people off these high doses of opioids, anti anxiety medication and sleeping tablets,” said Elisabetta Faenza.  Ms Faenza is the CEO and co-founder of Leafcann, a company that seeks to manufacture botanical medicines and is working to bring medical cannabis products to the Australian market.  She has an obvious incentive to champion the use of medicinal cannabis but says the industry and much of the public want to see more options to treat pain, nausea and anxiety. Medicinal marijuana has been legal in Australia for the past two years but it is still very hard to access for a lot eligible patients around the country.  “The beauty of medicinal cannabis is that — as opposed to the illicit use of recreational cannabis — when it’s being prescribed by a doctor appropriately, the right genetic type of cannabis strain can be prescribed in an oil or a capsule — a way that it has a metered dose, a way that you know you’re getting so many milligrams of CBD and so many milligrams of THC.” CBD oil has been shown to be useful in treating inflammatory pain as well as nausea and vomiting produced by chemotherapy or other therapeutic treatments. “And very small doses of THC can help with sleep,” Ms Faenza said.  However experts warn that evidence of THC’s benefits is weak and high doses of THC have been shown to increase anxiety in some people.  “We’re not saying go out and smoke a joint,” Ms Faenza said. “We’re saying that controlled prescribed medicinal use should be added to the Special Access Scheme for patients whose doctors are concerned that long term use of synthetic opioids is a concern.”  A new report released by the Penington Institute this week warned that deaths from sleeping and anxiety pills have become a “hidden epidemic”, more than doubling in the last decade. It showed there were 2177 drug-related deaths in Australia in 2016. Deaths from sleeping and anxiety pills, opioids and methamphetamines have all risen sharply. A separate report released last week also sounded the alarm on opioid misuse. According to the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at UNSW in Sydney, there were 1045 Australians aged 15-64 who died of an opioid overdose in 2016. Opioid related deaths have nearly doubled from 2007 to 2016.  Ms Faenza says now is the time to look at alternatives for pain management, nausea, anxiety, depression and PSTD as concerns rise around opioid reliance.  There is a body of evidence suggesting that marijuana products can be useful in treating chronic pain but adoption in Australia has been slow to happen.  “People naturally get frustrated,” she said. “They don’t want to break the law, and nor should they have to.” It’s a frustration she experienced first hand when she lost her father to cancer and watched him suffer through the pain brought on by treatment. “He would’ve really been served in those last six months with a medicinal cannabis product, but at that point in time cancer pain wasn’t on the list (of approved therapies),” she said. “At least it would’ve been good to try it.” In March, Health Minister Greg Hunt slashed red tape around medical marijuana making it much quicker to access for NSW patients with the approval process relying solely on a single clinical assessment by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Other states are following suit, reducing the time it takes for patients to get medical cannabis drugs.  But Ms Faenza says there is still some opposition to medical marijuana products. “The Australian Medical Association’s position has softened but certain state branches of the AMA are incredibly negative and that has really put fear into doctors,” she said. “Doctors are reporting that they’re getting many requests from patients to look at medicinal cannabis and just don’t feel equipped to deal with the issue.”  The Medical Cannabis Council has expressed the same sentiment, lamenting that medical professionals often view medicinal cannabis as a “medication of last resort”.

THE people of Norfolk Island are fighting for the territory’s right to become Australia’s legally-grown cannabis capital — Cannabis Island. More than 14,000 supporters have rallied behind a petition to allow medicinal cannabis to be grown on Norfolk Island. Earlier this month, Norfolk Island’s health minister Robin Adams issued a licence to medicinal cannabis growing company TasCann. Last week that licence was overturned by Norfolk’s Australian government representative Gary Hardgrave who has the final say on these matters. MORE: Medical marijuana the key to Katelyn’s survival  MORE: Time for medicine to go to pot So the island’s chance to lead the charge in the treatment of medical conditions with legally grown cannabis has essentially gone up in smoke, but the Island locals are not going to take this one lying down. Since Mr Hardgrave announced the decision to veto the licence that Norfolk’s Legislative Assembly granted, Norfolk resident and natural medicine student Gabrielle Beaumont has led a campaign to “stop blocking access to medicinal cannabis”, and her change.org petition has been backed by more than 14,000 signatories in less than 36 hours. “While thousands of Australians, and every published poll shows that most people support the decriminalisation of medicinal cannabis — the Australian government has just blocked the people of Norfolk Island from growing it for medical use,” the petition reads. “It’s shocking, unfair, and just wrong — and it means that for thousands of families, the challenge of trying to cope with terminal illnesses gets even harder.” “The people of Norfolk Island are well and truly behind this,” Ms Beaumont told news.com.au. “It’s a no-brainer really. I think if the Australian government had actually looked at the evidence their decision would be different. Their logic is that growing and using cannabis has always been illegal in their lifetime, therefore it’s not going to change. I haven’t actually seen any reason why this decision would be made by Mr Hardgrave if he was informed.” Medicinal marijuana is legal in parts of the United Kingdom, Canada, Israel and 23 states in the US.  MORE: A mother should not be treated as a criminal for using medicinal cannabis MORE: Parents face questions over marijuana oil treatment Another petition started by NSW mum Lucy Haslam to decriminalise medical cannabis for people like her terminally ill son, has prompted a bill to be considered in state parliament. Federal MPs are working on the bill to legalise it in Australia, but Federal Health Minister Peter Dutton is yet to lend his support. Ms Beaumont also argues the economic benefits of growing medicinal cannabis could bring to the struggling community. “It’s no secret Norfolk Island is in dire financial straits,” she said. “There’s a growing market internationally and there’s obviously people in Australia who need it and people who are wanting something like this. “The company is there, willing, the product’s available to grow, it’s just government and red tape and legislation in place, that’s the only hurdle. I just hope not only for Norfolk Island but for Australia this decision will be reversed.” CEO of TasCann Troy Langman has arrived on Norfolk Island to join members of the public rallying to reverse the Australian Government’s decision. “We’re obviously disappointed,” he said. “The ramifications will be that the public will be denied access to relief that they desperately need. That’s the reality. “People’s lives will continue to be put at risk, such as children with Dravet syndrome, epilepsy, cancer, there’s a whole list fo medical conditions cannabis can help with.” Norfolk Island’s health minister Robin Adams has called for community consultation and has urged the Australian Government to reverse the decision. “It is most regrettable that an economic initiative with the capacity to generate substantial income and employment for this community over time has needed to be put on hold,” she said in a statement. “But I give the community the assurance of both myself and my ministerial colleagues that we will continue to work with the Commonwealth Government to achieve what we trust can be a satisfactory outcome that a further licence can be issued to TasCann.” To join the conversation, please

ANOTHER ONE NATION CANDIDATE DUMPED “Most of you know I’ve been a long advocate of Medicinal Cannabis, due to its effective relief for so many ailments, conventional drugs can’t offer,” Ms Hanson posted on her Facebook page. “I can reveal yesterday, I appealed directly to the Prime Minister to intervene and give amnesty to users and suppliers of this vital life saving drug so many people and families are no longer forced to use this in secret.” Senator Hanson called for the politicians across Australia to follow the lead of the Labor Government and LNP opposition in Queensland, who in a bipartisan agreement last year, passed legislation to allow patients to access medicinal cannabis.  She called on the Prime Minister to look at federal legislation to allow for legal suppliers to operate within the law. “My understanding is, there is no legal supplier at present in Australia and hence the police raid on this supplier,” she wrote.  South Australian police raided the northern Adelaide home of Jenny Hallam last Wednesday morning and seized products and equipment related to the production of cannabis oil. A long-time advocate for medicinal cannabis, Ms Hallam supplies her cannabis oil to the sick and terminally ill all across Australia. Senator Hanson said anyone who backs new medicinal cannabis legislation should contact the Prime Minister. “Please show your support and let’s lobby the Prime Minister to intervene and help save these families. I’m sure his office would appreciate your call tomorrow on (02) 9327 3988.  “Be nice, though, we want his support! “I thank all politicians who have got behind this cause and ask those who haven’t, raise your white flag on party politics for a moment and lets work together to give these people some help in a time of need.” Senator Hanson and Mr Turnbull have been contacted for further comment.

But others are not sure they want him involved. As Pete Evans wades into the evolving debate around medicinal cannabis, a longtime advocate of the drug has expressed concerns about the controversy that comes with the celebrity chef’s involvement. Lucy Haslam, a campaigner for medicinal usage of the drug, told news.com.au that her involvement with Evans earlier this year led to her being “slammed” by members of the medical community. Evans is set to appear on Channel 7’s Sunday Night program as a “special guest reporter” as the show weighs up the pros and cons of medicinal cannabis. His involvement has made supporters of medicinal cannabis nervous. They say the celebrity chef poses problems for the cause. “This bloke is not an ideal spokesman does more harm than good to the cause, [sic]” one man wrote in an advocacy group on Facebook. “I hate that this idiot is the one advocating this,” another woman commented. “Dear Australia, Pete Evans is a national embarrassment.” “Blokes a nut. Not great for the cause, [sic]” another said. Others felt Evans’s involvement would help, as would any publicity for medicinal cannabis. “Any positive publicity of this miracle plant will help, we need to flood mainstream TV with the positives of this plant,” one woman wrote. “Good onya Pete.” Ms Haslam, a founding director of United in Compassion (UIC), Australia’s peak medicinal cannabis advocacy body, told news.com.au that Evans contacted her earlier this year and attended events she’d organised as he filmed his cannabis documentary. “Pete contacted me at the beginning of the year. He’d met a doctor I know from Santa Barbara,” Ms Haslam said. “He came to my symposium and interviewed people for his documentary. I was happy for him to come,” she explained, saying she is open-minded to anyone interested in learning about the benefits of medicinal cannabis. Ms Haslam explained that she later invited Evans to a gala dinner, and as soon as his intentions to attend were made public, she was “slammed” by members of the medical profession.  She explained that about the same time, Evans posted something on Facebook to do with an anti-vaccination group. “It got very complicated,” Ms Haslam said. She contacted Evans to rescind his invite to the dinner, telling him she was in “big strife” because of the reaction from the medical community. Evans, who has 1.5 million followers on Facebook and more than 200,000 on Instagram, has courted controversy in recent years by sharing views that contravene medical advice.  Earlier this year, Evans shared a podcast from a prominent US anti-vaxxer, urging his followers to listen to the podcast, which referred to doctors as “prostitutes” and made a number of false claims about vaccinated children. Evans also referred to types of sunscreen as toxic in 2016 and has made a number of claims over the years about diet and connections to illnesses like osteoporosis. In June 2018 the Australian Medical Association called for his documentary The Magic Pill to be removed from Netflix following his claims a ketogenic diet could benefit cancer sufferers and those with autism. Ms Haslam said she held no personal judgment of Evans but found the experience of involving him with her organisation “complicated”. “I’m afraid whatever his intentions are in this space, they’ll be misconstrued,” she said. “It would be good to have a celebrity in this space, but Pete invites controversy. “We already having trouble in Australia getting doctors to come on-board,” Ms Haslam explained, saying most advocates want cannabis to be considered a legitimate form of medical treatment. “If he becomes the face of medicinal cannabis, it’s going to invite controversy at a time when we’re trying to make people realise it’s a valid medicine.” Evans earlier announced he was producing his own documentary about cannabis, part of which he filmed at UIC’s cannabis symposium. Ms Haslam said Evans hired his own space nearby and took advantage of a number of experts being in the one place for the documentary. Ms Haslam has been an advocate for legalising medicinal marijuana for people who suffer terminal and chronic conditions since 2015 when her son, Dan Haslam, went public with his story of using the drug to treat his cancer. Dan fought a five-year battle with bowel cancer and during that time used cannabis to treat the nausea, vomiting and lack of appetite caused by his chemotherapy. Dan sadly passed away in 2015, but Ms Haslam has continued her advocacy work, founding the UIC and working to have the drug gain wider acceptance in Australia. Ms Haslam believes more than a million Australians use cannabis for their chronic pain and other illnesses. “We’re so far behind the world (with this treatment) it’s lonely and it’s embarrassing,” Ms Haslam said. “Australia is really a laughing stock.” A UIC spokesman told news.com.au he didn’t agree with all of Evans’ personal views but urged viewers of the documentary to look beyond the host. “Mr Evans holds a number of views on a range of issues with which we are not in agreement,” he said in a statement. “We nevertheless do not feel it right or fair that we comment on a TV program which we have not seen and which has not as yet even been aired.  “The issue of medicinal cannabis is one that’s far more important than any one person — including Pete Evans.” The spokesman said the real issue for advocates were the “hundreds of thousands of sick Australians” seeking to use cannabis that were forced to engage with the black market. “In light of this we suggest anyone watching the program look beyond the presenter and instead focus on what is significant here — that the public has been cheated when it comes to medicinal cannabis,” the spokesman said.

Queensland will soon decide whether medicinal cannabis users should be allowed to drive while under the influence as part of a widespread review of the state’s drug-driving rules. The review is in response to the growing number of drug-driving offences and an increase in fatal crashes on Queensland’s roads. Driving with THC in the system – the psychoactive substance in medicinal cannabis – is illegal in Queensland. The Department of Transport and Main Roads (TMR) said the government was “acutely aware” of the challenges faced by those who wished to use the drug and keep their licence. However, TMR general manager Andrew Mahon said the issue was a “very complex and difficult one to solve”. The main concern is the cognitive and motor function impairment that can be caused by the psychoactive component of THC. The review will consider different approaches to deter offending, including enforcement and offender management, and is expected to be completed by the end of 2023. It comes a month after NRL Immortal Andrew Johns revealed that medicinal cannabis “changed his life” after dealing with chronic pain during his retirement. The Greens have previously called on the government to allow medicinal cannabis users to drive on Queensland roads. In Tasmania, driving with a detectable amount of THC is an offence – unless the product is obtained and administered in accordance with the state’s Poisons Act. Drivers are being warned to be cautious in the coming days as a five-day operation begins, with motorists facing double demerits throughout.

ABOUT seven people a day are being approved for medicinal cannabis as new research suggests the $18 million industry could be worth billions within a decade. Access to the drug is still severely restricted two years after its medicinal use was legalised nationally but a new online application system has increased approvals in recent months. The Therapeutic Goods Administration approved 469 applications for the drug under the Special Access Scheme between August and September. That’s up from just 97 between January and February. The TGA notes it is unable to calculate patient numbers accurately and it’s possible for one patient to have multiple applications approved. Regardless, the industry is expected to boom in the coming years, exciting the medicinal cannabis pharmaceutical sector, advocates and patients who have converged on Sydney this week for the CannaTech conference. Market intelligence firm Prohibition Partners will discuss its new report that suggests the nation’s legal medicinal cannabis market, currently valued at $17.7 million annually, could balloon to $1.2 billion by 2024 and then $3 billion by 2028. Australia’s cannabis industry could grow even more with a recreational market worth up to $8.8 billion annually in a decade if it is legalised soon, the report says. One of the first Australians to access legal cannabis oil was NSW father Simon Sweeting, who had treated his chronic spinal pain with 10 to 15 tablets a day. He said he needed to jump through all kinds of hoops, including easing the concerns of his GP, for almost a year to access legal cannabis oil.  But after starting on the oil in February, he is now tablet-free.  “I take the oil daily, orally in a liquid form that tastes a bit like grapeseed oil,” the 47-year-old told AAP. “It’s changed my life.”  Joshua Eades, the chief science officer at Canadian medicinal cannabis producer Tilray, acknowledges getting medical professionals on board is an integral part of allowing more patients to access legal cannabis treatments.  He said the biggest misconception is that side effects and harms from cannabis are worse than other pain relief medications such as opioids.  “As with any medical product, there are side effects but ... medical cannabis can be a much less harmful option for patients,” he said.  The researcher also stressed the recreational and medical cannabis industries are on very separate tracks, with his employer focused on safe ways to treat epileptic seizures, PTSD and other ailments. “That’s an entirely different story to recreational cannabis use,” Dr Eades said.

THE Melbourne couple that controversially gave their sick toddler cannabis oil now fear for their son’s life after hospital doctors last night threatened to call the police if the drug was administered.  Cassie Batten and Rhett Wallace discharged their son Cooper from The Northern Hospital in Epping before the cannabis could be confiscated. They now feel they have nowhere to turn because doctors refuse to use the drug on hospital grounds. It is the first time the family has been prepared to reveal the name of the hospital that has been supporting the use of the cannabis oil and tincture for the treatment of the three-year-old’s life-threatening seizures. Hospital records show staff at The Northern previously included cannabis oil on Cooper’s drug chart. PREVIOUSLY: Parents face questions over marijuana treatment But staff yesterday called off their support. Hospital spokesman Ryan Brown said: “it is inappropriate for The Northern Hospital to comment on a patient’s health or well being. It is, however, Northern Hospital policy not to condone the administration of an illegal substance”. One of the hospital’s lawyers last night tried negotiating with Mr Wallace, who admitted to becoming emotional during a meeting with staff. “They (the hospital) said they would call the police and confiscate the cannabis. “Out of respect we have not intended to release the name of the hospital but now we feel we have no choice, we believe he could go downhill.” The parents acknowledged removing Cooper was against medical advice. “Our opinion is that he should be in hospital, but if he can’t have the cannabis oil then he is going to go backwards,” Mr Wallace said. “We would rather take the risk of the short-term illness, try to manage it at home, than the risk of brain damage which is what happens every time he has a seizure.” Mr Wallace and Ms Batten said they had rushed Cooper to emergency about 11.30am after he developed a fever and became dehydrated. “Like any person, we don’t want police involvement but we will go to any length for Cooper, ,” Mr Wallace said. The parents called state politicians from the hospital ward last night. Both parties have previously vowed to overhaul the law and allow the clinical trials of medicinal cannabis.  “We’re stuck in a solution where both major political parties are willing to support it in future but we need a solution here and now, for Cooper’s sake,” Mr Wallace said. andrea.hamblin@news.com.au Originally published as Parents of toddler Cooper, treated with medicinal cannabis, told police would be called if drug used again To join the conversation, please

USERS of medicinal cannabis will not be allowed to drive with the drug in their system, even if it is made legal in South Australia, Police Minister Peter Malinauskas has confirmed. MPs are debating new laws to increase penalties for drink and drug driving in State Parliament. Answering questions on the legislation, Mr Malinauskas also foreshadowed that almost $100,000 extra would be needed each year to ensure that forensic scientists can keep up with a growing number of driver drug tests. SA Police conduct random roadside tests that must later be confirmed by a laboratory. Mr Malinauskas said he expected that Forensic Science SA, which conducts the second tests, would “see an increase in samples for laboratory confirmation” as result of the new laws, and this would require $95,000 more to process each year. Figures presented to Parliament show that between 2012 and 2016 there were 4,474 people who tested positive for THC — the active drug in the cannabis plant — while driving on South Australian roads. Thousands more tested positive to THC in combination with another drug, such as ecstasy or ice. Mr Malinauskas said that if South Australia’s Parliament passed laws legalising the use of marijuana for medical treatment then users “would need to ensure that the THC is no longer present in their system prior to driving”. “The screening devices used are able to detect THC for several hours after use,” he said. “Inactive THC residue in the body of a driver from use in previous days or weeks will not be detected.” People who are found to have THC in their system are currently given a written direction not to drive for five hours. “Drugs affect a person’s judgment and may result in dangerous driving behaviour if the drug driver feels impatient, aggressive or has a heightened sense of their own abilities,” Mr Malinauskas said.  The Government’s proposed laws would impose a new three-month licence disqualification for a anyone caught drug-driving for the first time and increased licence disqualification periods for repeat offences.   Any driver detected drug or drink-driving with a child aged under 16 in the car will be made to undergo a drug or alcohol dependency assessment before their licence would be reissued. Child protection authorities will also be notified. Opposition police spokesman Stephan Knoll will move to amend the legislation to allow people to complete drug rehabilitation instead of undergoing a dependency test. “We want to be smart on crime and we want to help people to help themselves ... to seek treatment so they can get clean and stay clean,” he said. There is only one clinic in SA which carries out drug or alcohol dependency assessments and the waiting period is between four and six weeks. Mr Malinauskas said the Government would call for more clinics to provide the assessments “within the next year”. However, he warned that “previous market assessments have found that there were no other clinics able to provide this service in SA”. “There are few private addiction specialists in South Australia, with most working for the government,” he told Parliament. Mr Knoll said it was “pretty clear that there will be delays in obtaining drug dependency tests and delays in getting results from Forensic Science SA”.

Medical cannabis prescriber Montu now holds the record for the most amount of funds raised through crowd-funding in Australia as a result of 2020 and 2021 campaigns attracting the backing of a whopping $5.5 million. In November, it hit its maximum target of $3.5 million in just over one day – the second largest single raise in Australian history, with investors raising the first million dollars in 13 minutes, even crashing the Birchal crowd-funding site. Montu develops cannabinoid-based products and makes them accessible to patients through a nationwide network of doctors, originally starting in Canada before launching in Australia in 2019. Christopher Strauch, managing director of Montu, said the company’s aim is to make medical cannabis more widely available to Aussies, while also breaking down the stigma surrounding it. “Not only is it a new medication but also it’s a medication historically known as a drug, so stigma is the biggest barrier in Australia for adoption,” he told news.com.au. “It’s simply people have misconceptions. Back in medical school it was educated on the basis it was a drug of dependency and how can we help people stop using cannabis and get away from cannabis. “Now doctors and people have to change their mind entirely and now it offers therapeutic good and it’s safety profile is significantly better than opioids or SSRIs, which are used with depression or anxiety.” Mr Strauch said chronic conditions are ideal for treatment with medicinal cannabis, such as chronic pain, epilepsy, Alzheimers and migraines, as many people build up a tolerance to other drugs, which raises the potential of overdoses. “There are no recorded deaths due to overuse of cannabis, it’s significantly safer and with a better side effect profile,” he said. “With opioids people can feel groggy, drowsy and have other types of side effects that impact their quality of life and where they can’t go back to work or enjoy hobbies, but medical cannabis significantly improves that from side effect profile and they can enjoy life again, there is very limited downside.” Yet according to Montu, only 5 per cent of doctors prescribe medicinal cannabis in Australia, with uptake slow as they only give it to the most extreme cases. However, huge changes have been occurring in the space this year including allowing CBD products to be made available over the counter at pharmacies provided clinical trials have taken place and Tasmania joining other states by no longer restricting medical cannabis prescribing to specialists. Montu has experienced 1000 per cent growth in the last 12 months, raking in $14 million aided by increased adoption of telehealth, home-delivery of medications and electronic scripts, according to the company. It is managing more than 15,000 patient consultations a year and prescribing 50,000 units of medical cannabis annually. “Telehealth has been a game changer for the many Australians with conditions that can be treated with medical cannabis,” Mr Strauch said.  “Prior to telehealth, our company was already a pioneer in helping patients gain easy access via a nationwide network of doctors that could service half a million Australians. With telehealth – we can now service every Australian.” Montu has trained over 1000 Australian doctors on medical cannabis and provided them with education and support he added.  “This has seen doctors become more confident prescribers,” he said. “Their wealth of real-life Australian patient experience will benefit those who want the very best advice. We manage the medical cannabis supply chain vertically from doctor education, clinical care, product supply and distribution, to dispensing of medication.” Proceeds from the fundraising will be used to further invest in its technological infrastructure and grow patient awareness.

The Victorian government will back a push for medicinal cannabis patients to be able to drive in an Australian-first move. Victorian Reason Party MP Fiona Patten – behind the push supported in parliament on Wednesday – said it was “simply unfair” Australia was “the only jurisdiction” that prevented medicinal cannabis patients from driving 24/7.  “I am pleased that the government has seen sense and will move to change the laws around medicinal cannabis and driving – it’s about time,” she said.  The bill aims to treat medicinal cannabis, prescribed by a doctor, in the same way as any other prescription medication under the Road Safety Act. It would mean driving laws are changed, with the government to establish an implementation taskforce that will work with doctors, legal experts and MPs around those changes.  The taskforce will then report back to parliament by December 18.  “The average medicinal cannabis patient is a 55 year old woman. These patients gain great relief from their medication but should be able to drive their kids to school in the morning,” Ms Patten said. But the move was met with stern opposition from the Liberal Party, with Member for Northern Metropolitan Region Craig Ondarchie likening the government’s approval of the bill to an episode of The Block.  “You get to vote on it before the job is complete – there is still a lot of work to be done on this bill before it should come to the house for approval,” he said.  Opposition health spokeswoman Georgie Crozier said the bill was “somewhat risky”. “It’s really about the inability to test that impairment level,” she said. “We can do that with blood alcohol but the ability to detect the presence of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) is very difficult … until there can be that specific test being undertaken then it is somewhat risky.” Medicinal cannabis is generally prescribed for epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, symptom relief in palliative care and symptoms associated with cancer and cancer treatment.

LITTLE Katelyn Lambert can suffer up to 1400 seizures a day and medicinal cannabis could save her life. Her grandparents, Barry and Joy Lambert, today made the biggest-ever donation to research at the University of Sydney to investigate the future use of medicinal cannabis in treating childhood epilepsy and other serious illnesses. Mr Lambert said he and his wife made the $33.7 million gift after seeing his granddaughter respond to cannabis treatments for her debilitating condition. “Our vision is to make Australia a world-leader in researching how to realise the powerful medicinal potential of the cannabis plant,” Mr Lambert said. “The experience of our granddaughter, who suffers debilitating epilepsy, has opened our eyes to the extraordinary possibility of cannabinoids treating not only her condition but a range of chronic illnesses that often don’t respond to conventional treatments. “We believe this investment in the future of Australian science and medicine will provide the much-needed evidence to rapidly advance the use of medicinal cannabinoids in the treatment of childhood epilepsy and other serious illnesses.”  University of Sydney Vice Chancellor Dr Michael Spence said the donation would put Australia ahead of all other countries in researching the medicinal properties of the cannabis plant. “The Lamberts’ unprecedented gift holds the promise of achieving innovative and effective new medicines to alleviate the suffering of countless numbers of people,” Dr Spence said. “It enables research across a broad range of applications from addiction, cancer, obesity, childhood epilepsy and chronic pain to dementia and mental health disorders. Their generosity recognises the University’s commitment to cross-disciplinary research that can achieve life-changing outcomes. It is our privilege and responsibility to respond.” NSW Premier Mike Baird thanked the Lamberts for the donation and said he hoped it would result in cannabis-based medicines being readily available.  MEDICAL CANNABIS IS SERIOUS: IT’S NOT ABOUT GIGGLING TEENS THE PROBLEMS WITH LEGALISING MEDICAL CANNABIS “NSW is breaking new ground in terms of medical cannabis research and this major investment confirms our state's leadership in this area,” Mr Baird said. “The Lamberts' investment gives our cause enormous momentum and my hope is it dramatically increases the cross-sector knowledge sharing required to ultimately produce cannabinoid-based medicines that are safe, reliable and affordable.” Last year, Mr Baird announced the government would run clinical trials on the use of medicinal cannabis to treat epilepsy, chemotherapy-related nausea and chronic pain of the terminally ill.

Their dad took matters into his own hands and now he faces jail. STEPHEN Taylor has watched his daughters suffer from the life-changing effects of Crohn’s disease for years. He’s not just seen them repeatedly hospitalised because of the crippling auto-immune condition, he’s actually had to physically carry his girls — who are now adults in their early twenties — by himself to seek treatment. “A couple of times there I carried Morgan into hospital weighing around 32kg — actually carrying her in my arms and crying,” the father from NSW told ABC’s 7.30. Morgan, 21, and Ariel, 25, told the public broadcaster that they no longer feel like they are living, merely surviving as they battle the disease and the side effects of the drugs they take to treat the condition. It was because of this that Mr Taylor asked doctors about medicinal cannabis to ease his daughters’ pain. However, he told ABC that no doctor was willing to even attempt to take on the long and arduous process of obtaining legal medical cannabis through the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). So, he decided to take matters into his own hands and started juicing cannabis to ease his children’s suffering. Now his home has been raided by the police and he is facing jail. “I kind of say that I’m not living anymore, I’m just surviving and that’s what’s really hard,” Morgan said. “It’s not just you that it’s affecting, it’s affecting everyone around you.” Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis are collectively known as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and affect more than 80,000 Australians. According to national peak patient body Crohn’s & Colitis Australia, the disease is largely unpredictable — as there is a significant variation in the degree and pattern of symptoms affecting each patient.  “During a disease flare, inflammation in the colon, rectum and gastrointestinal tract can become so severe that sufferers need to be hospitalised or require surgery,” the website states. However, Morgan said that the side effects of traditional drugs used to treat the disease have been devastating for her and her sister. “I got really bad arthritis … my knees were swollen and I couldn’t walk some days,” she told 7.30. “I had a severe reaction to another drug called infliximab — my throat started closing up, I was having anaphylaxis reaction, my face was swelling up, I was getting a rash. “That was very serious.” Ariel told the ABC she almost died from haemorrhaging. “I was so sick I wasn’t able to eat … I was in constant pain,” she said. “The doctors were preparing [my parents], when I was going through the surgery [to remove my colon], the fact that I could die. It was pretty intense.” However when the girls started taking the cannabis juice, they told 7.30 that their lives changed completely. Morgan said it was like the disease had disappeared altogether. However, medicinal cannabis in Australia is notoriously hard to get hold of, despite it being legalised more than 18 months ago.  Former schoolteacher from Queensland Paul Hilder, who was involved in a car crash that left his heel shattered causing him to live in constant pain, told news.com.au earlier this year that it was almost impossible to get hold of medicinal cannabis. After months of trying, he found himself no closer to being given access to the medicine, with it appearing to be reserved only for those that were terminally ill. And even though he told his doctors that recreational weed had helped with pain relief, Mr Hilder found himself offered methadone, OxyContin and other opiates instead. “It might only sound minor, but marijuana helps me walk more freely around my house, which is a huge win for quality of life,” he said. These are not rare cases. Iain McGregor, professor of Psychopharmacology at the  Lambert Initiative For Cannabinoid Therapeutics at Sydney University told the ABC that he estimates 100,000 Australians could be using illegal cannabis for a variety of health problems. NSW Police allege that Mr Taylor had 107 plants when he was raided by police. He told the ABC that his daughters were using a combined total of 180ml of cannabis juice a day. Prof McGregor added that drinking cannabis juice, as Morgan and Ariel were, was not the same as smoking a joint, as the consumer doesn’t take in as much THC which is the intoxicating part of the plant. “You get another component of cannabinoid, which is THCA [tetrahydrocannabinolic acid], which has very strong anti-inflammatory properties in the gut,” he told 7.30. Crohn’s & Colitis Australia said the number of Crohn’s sufferers in Australia is expected to increase to more than 100,000 by 2022. “The conditions are becoming more prevalent, more severe and more complex and are being diagnosed in more and more very young patients,” its website said. The Federal Department of Health website states that it is difficult for doctors to prescribe medicinal cannabis. “There have only been a limited number of well-designed clinical studies on medicinal cannabis and so it is hard for some doctors to find quality evidence to support decisions to prescribe medicinal cannabis,” it states.  — with Matt Dunn  Share your opinion, follow @bengrahamjourno or email benjamin.graham@news.com.au To join the conversation, please

AN AUSTRALIAN-first study of medicinal cannabis as a treatment for the debilitating neurological condition Tourette syndrome is set to be launched in Brisbane. Wesley Medical Research Institute neuropsychiatrist Philip Mosley will trial a medicinal cannabis product in 24 adults with severe Tourette syndrome – a disorder which begins in childhood and is characterised by involuntary movements and vocalisations.  Many people with the condition also experience anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. The condition is associated with bullying and poor academic performance in childhood and adolescence, and with unemployment and social isolation as an adult. Existing treatments include antipsychotic medications, which suppress involuntary movements, but they are also associated with severe side-effects, including weight gain and high cholesterol. Dr Mosley said deep brain stimulation was also effective in Tourette syndrome patients but it was costly and highly invasive, requiring surgery. “The people with Tourette syndrome who’ve had deep brain stimulation are doing well, but not everyone wants to have brain surgery,” he said.  Dr Mosley said he expected the medical cannabis trial to begin mid-year with a pharmaceutical product containing a mixture of cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) – two of the chemical compounds in cannabis. “We think it’s a combination of the two that will hit the sweet spot,” he said. Dr Mosley suspects THC alone may benefit Tourette syndrome patients. But because of concern about its psychoactive properties, which may increase anxiety and precipitate psychosis, he hoped that by adding CBD it would reduce the potential for harmful complications. The treatment will be given as a tablet or in liquid form. Dr Mosley said many doctors were unwilling to prescribe medicinal cannabis because “there’s very limited evidence for it for most conditions”. “I think doctors are rightly cautious,” he said. “I’m hoping that this trial, if it’s beneficial for this condition, will enable doctors to prescribe with more confidence if they have a patient with Tourette syndrome.” The trial has been made possible through a $100,000 grant from the Wesley Medical Research Institute.

THE family of a four-year-old boy has welcomed news that the State Government plans to fund the use of medicinal cannabis in a trial for people suffering terminal or life-threatening illnesses.  Nationally recognised as one of the most controversial cases surrounding the use of the drug, young epileptic Cooper Wallace, with his family, stood tall in light of the announcement.  “It’s exciting. We just hope that the laws can change quick enough for children like Cooper, and we’re not left waiting,” his mother, Cassie Batten, said.  PARENTS PLEAD FOR LEGAL MEDICAL MARIJUANA TO HELP SICK SON  Cooper’s progress and having the chance to pave the way for other families suffering a similar fate was worth the battle they had faced, Ms Batten said.  “He couldn’t sit, he couldn’t crawl, he couldn’t eat or drink orally. He was in hospital for over 200 days one year, and the longest he was home was only 16 days,” she said.  “He had no quality of life at all. Now he is having, on average, 15-20 days a year in hospital, he is off a lot of pharmaceutical medication, he is crawling, sitting, beginning to stand, so he’s doing very well.”  The family is not certain if Cooper will participate in trial but said it was a great stepping stone for regulating the drug.  Premier Daniel Andrews said the Government would work toward legalising the use of medicinal cannabis for families like Cooper’s if the trial proved to make a significant difference.  “I was convinced by (Cooper’s) experience that medicinal cannabis works and that medicinal cannabis is really such an effective and lifesaving treatment therapy for so many families, particularly those who have infants who have really poor quality of life,” he said.  “That convinced us that no parent should ever have to choose between saving their child’s life and breaking the law, that’s not a choice we should make any parent make.”  In partnership with the NSW government the trial is expected to begin in mid-2016 and will first be tested on 60 to 200 children with severe, drug resistant epilepsy.

A CHRONIC pain sufferer convicted of drug offences over his medicinal cannabis crop says Australia’s laws must change so seriously ill people can relieve their pain. Daniel Eli Bain left the District Court today with a pair of convictions, but no further penalty, for the 76 cannabis plants he grew between January 2011 and June 2012. Judge Paul Slattery said the 15 months and 28 days Bain had spent in custody prior to his trial was sufficient penalty, but stressed cannabis was “a large problem in our society”. Outside court, Bain told The Advertiser he was grateful for Judge Slattery’s approach, but now faced an uncertain future dealing with his chronic pain. “Opiates are not something I’m about to do and, obviously, growing (cannabis) is out of the question — I’ve been arrested far too many times, it’s far too dangerous,” he said. “I’m just going to have to deal with the pain, which is increasing incrementally year after year. “Australia needs something similar to the laws in America, where you’re allowed to grow your own ... I hope that happens, but I don’t see our government doing the right thing.” Bain, 38, of Blakeview, had pleaded not guilty to two counts of cultivating a commercial quantity of a controlled plant. He instead pleaded guilty to the lesser offence of cultivating a controlled plant — a plea rejected by prosecutors. At his trial in July, prosecutors alleged at least some of the 43 plants Bain grew at Elizabeth Downs, and the 33 plants he grew at Elizabeth Park, were for commercial use. Bain denied this, saying every plant was to be used to ease the chronic pain he had suffered for 15 years — a malady that could not be aided by prescription medications. He said he smoked “more than an ounce a week, even up to two ounces a week” to keep the pain at bay. Jurors rejected his evidence in part, finding him guilty of growing the 33-plant crop for commercial use but finding he had no intention to profit from the 43-plant harvest. Today, Judge Slattery said that finding reactivated Bain’s plea to the lesser offence, meaning he was to be sentenced for two crimes. He noted doctors had diagnosed Bain with chronic arthritic pain in his legs, back and hands, and with Fibromyalgia, or widespread pain throughout the skin and muscles. “I acknowledge the evidence given ... in relation to the medicinal benefits of cannabis in relation to the treatment of chronic pain,” he said. “In your evidence, you said that you experienced the full effect of smoking cannabis (only) in order to obtain its medical benefit. “This has all the hallmarks of specious reasoning, but it’s not necessary for me to give further consideration to the matter.” Judge Slattery said Bain’s offences — the latest in a long history of cannabis-related charges — “were not trivial” and both he and the public should be discouraged from growing the drug. “Cultivating cannabis, for any reason, is still illegal in Australia and a large problem in our society,” he said.

War veterans are crying out for medicinal cannabis funding, with the drug reportedly easing PTSD and pain more than traditional treatments.  The Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA) accepts applications to use cannabis for pain, provided it’s approved by a specialist.  But many pain specialists are reluctant to tick off the treatment due to a lack of research in the space, instead prescribing opioids veterans don’t want to take.  The DVA doesn’t approve cannabis for PTSD or any mental-health related issues, leaving antidepressants and sleeping pills as options.  Without the DVA’s financial support, veterans are struggling to keep paying for medicinal cannabis.  Vietnam veteran Michael, who asked for his full name not to be used, has struggled with PTSD since the war. He stopped taking antidepressants and painkillers after discovering cannabis.  “A few years ago, a friend of mine said, ‘Man, you need to chill’. I was on antidepressants, anti-anxiety tablets and quite a few other ones,” he said.  “I now don’t take any antidepressants, I don’t take any of the painkillers. I’d been self-medicating and staying away from those tablets for some time and now they’ve made (medicinal cannabis) legal, I’ve dropped off even more blood-pressure tablets.  “I now just vaporise – you don’t have a puff, you vaporise – and I’m good. I laugh a lot more, I have joy in my life, my quality of life is superb.” But Michael said he was “screaming out” for financial support from the DVA, with six weeks’ worth of medicinal cannabis costing him around $450.  “It’s crazy. Absolutely bloody crazy,” he said.  Chris Goulding, who served for five years, dislocated his shoulder while serving and now has arthritis in his back. Mr Goulding was on tramadol for a decade, experiencing anxiety and depression as side effects before discovering cannabis prescriber Dr James Stewart through a friend.  The 30-year-old swapped tramadol for medicinal cannabis and felt markedly “healthier”.  But Mr Goulding is a father of three and can’t afford to persist if the DVA doesn’t amend its protocols. He estimated he’d spent around $10k on the treatment in only two years.  “DVA have said they’re not approving medicinal cannabis for depression, anxiety or mental health because the side effects are too much of a risk. So they’ve cancelled that and said it’s only for pain,” Mr Goulding said.  “I’m a family man, I’ve got three kids, I can’t afford to keep this up.  “I’ve slowed down my intake of medicinal cannabis because of the cost. Sleep’s gotten worse, so I spoke to my pain specialist and he prescribed me tramadol again. “So after two years of finally kicking tramadol, I go back for an appointment and he gives me tramadol.  “They can look at the side effects of different medications over the long term. Ten years on tramadol, I never had anxiety before, now I’ve got that diagnosed.  “It’s little things like this. It plays with your depression and mental health in general.” In an email exchange between Dr Stewart, fellow prescriber Dr Jim Connell and the DVA, the veterans’ department said it would consider the doctors’ views when it reviewed its cannabis protocols.  But it is unclear when – or if – a review is planned. Dr Stewart offered to rewrite DVA protocols for free, arguing current guidelines are outdated and unreasonable.

A pair of Aussie Youtubers are claiming to have pulled off the ultimate stoner hack – beating a roadside drug test. Paton and Steeze, a Gold Coast-based social media duo, recently released a video of an April trip to Nimbin for the 2022 Mardigrass festival – billed as a “cannabis law reform rally and gathering”. While on the New South Wales side of the border, the pair is stopped by NSW Police running a roadside drug and alcohol test operation. Want to stream your news? Flash lets you stream 25+ news channels in 1 place. New to Flash? Try 1 month free. Offer ends 31 October, 2022 > When asked by the NSW Police officer if he had consumed any illicit drugs recently, Steeze replied: “Yeah – I’m prescribed medical cannabis”.  “So, yesterday afternoon I had a joint but I’m not under the influence.” What happened next appeared to surprise the two officers carrying out the roadside drug test.  Steeze did the lick test before being quizzed by the officers.  The driver hands over the prescription container which was holding his cannabis.  One officer studied the labelled container intently before passing it to his partner.  “Do you mind if I open it? I’ve never seen it legit,” the second officer said before asking Steeze how he ingested it.  Steeze told the officer he could either smoke it or vaporise it.  “I noticed it is in its original Dispenser container but I’ve never seen anyone be able to do that before … it’s (usually) just in a Satty bag,” the officer said.  The pair were given back the cannabis and Steeze’s licence and were sent on their way – with no reference of the outcome of the lick test.  The Alcohol and Drug Foundation states: “random roadside saliva tests can detect THC (the active ingredient in cannabis) for around 12 hours after use in people who use cannabis infrequently or ‘recreationally”.  But for frequent users, the tests can pick up cannabis for far longer.  “For people who frequently use cannabis, THC can usually be detected for around 30 hours,” the ADF says.  Paton and Steeze labelled a shortened version of the video on TikTok: “How to pass a drug test”.  But in the extended video on YouTube, after passing police for a second time on their way home from Nimbin, Steeze alluded to another method used to potentially navigate around drug tests.  “Now my mouth is completely scarred from that apple cider vinegar for no reason,” he said as they passed the police checkpoint unchecked.  Steeze later told the Daily Mail that he was prescribed cannabis for his epilepsy and to help him sleep. Paton also has a prescription.  According to Steeze, the container reads: “if not affected you can drive” – which he claims he wasn’t.  Medicinal cannabis use with a doctor’s prescription was legalised in 2016 but driving under the influence is still an offence under Australian laws. Two high-profile Queensland lawyers recently threw their weight behind a push to bring legislation in line with practical, medicinal uses.  Noosa Barrister Bernard Bradley and senate candidate told News Corp roadside drug tests were “too sensitive” and still detected THC well after the intoxicant had worn off.  “I have clients every week where I ask them … when they last used cannabis, and ninety-five per cent of the time it is well outside of the four hours,” he said. “Until and unless they can come up with a more accurate roadside test … it just should not be an offence.” Brisbane criminal defence lawyer, Terry O’Gorman, echoed the call.  “Drug driving laws need to be revised so they have a direct cause and effect between it being in your system and at the same time having an intoxicating effect,” he said. “A number of judges and magistrates throughout the country over the last 10 years have expressed considerable reservations about how unfair (it) is. “Drink driving laws obviously use graded readings … it is time the drug driving laws be brought into the same area.” The Queensland Government announced in late August, it will investigate whether medicinal cannabis users should be allowed to drive on Queensland roads as part of a broader review of the state’s drug driving rules The review is due to be complete in late 2023.  To join the conversation, please

THE Andrews Government has harvested Australia’s first medical cannabis crop.  ­ Canberra has also given the green light for a commercial company to also start growing plants. The cannabis, planted at a ­secret site last April, will be ­reserved for children with ­severe epilepsy this year. The crop is now being tested and formulated in preparation for the first patients. Victoria last year became the first Australian state to legalise cannabis for medicinal purposes.  STATE PARLIAMENT APPROVES LEGALISATION OF MEDICINAL CANNABIS The Office of Drug Control on Tuesday awarded the first Federal Government licence to Melbourne based Cann Group to legally cultivate and conduct research on the plants.  Cann Group chairman Allan McCallum said he was confident of securing a further licence to cultivate its crop to manufacture and sell medicinal cannabis in Australia. “The licence allows us to apply for a permit to progress our research and development programs, which are particularly focused on the breeding, cultivation, extraction and characterisation of cannabinoids,” he said. “It will also mean we can further discussions we have under way with a number of leading Australian research and technology organisations to access additional expertise and resources.”  DRUG AND RESEARCH GIANTS EYE VICTORIA TO GROW MEDICINAL CANNABIS CROPS Agriculture Minister Jaala Pulford said the state’s ­scientists had broken new ground. “Every step along the way takes us closer to being able to provide product to Victorians who need it the most,” she said. Construction has also been completed on a cultivation and manufacturing facility for supplying cannabis to patients.  Health Minister Jill Hennessy said medicinal cannabis made a profound difference on the lives of sick children.  “We promised Victorians they would be able to access this life-changing treatment.  “Every day brings us one step closer to delivering on this Australian-first commitment,” she said.  anthony.galloway@news.com.au Originally published as First medicinal cannabis crop harvested at secret Victorian site To join the conversation, please

Consumers are being warned against buying medicinal cannabis on the black market, with the products potentially posing dangerous risks to health. Australia’s health regulator warned consumers on Monday that products bought on the internet may be unsafe, of poor quality or contain a different dose to what the label claims. While fake products mimic authentic goods, the Therapeutic Goods Administration said they could contain undeclared dangerous ingredients. The lack of manufacturing and testing standards could also lead to the products being contaminated. The TGA said consumers should beware of buying medicine online, even though it might seem like a simple and affordable option. “Products bought over the internet may be a serious risk to your health and a waste of money,” the TGA said on Monday. “Products sold on the black market, especially from online sellers that do not request a doctor’s prescription, are unlikely to achieve the desired results and can be very dangerous.  “Using fake products can put you at serious risk of unpredictable or severe adverse reactions.” Medicinal cannabis products generally contain CBD and/or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is the psychoactive substance in cannabis. Australians can legally access medicinal cannabis if a registered doctor gives them a prescription, and the patient fills the prescription at a pharmacy. But aside from a small number of prescription-only products, medicinal cannabis products are not approved medicines in Australia, meaning they have not been assessed for safety, quality or effectiveness. A study in the Journal of Clinical Pharmacology found CBD products were commonly labelled with an inaccurate dose, and CBD concentration varied across batches of the same product purchased at different times. The study also found it was impossible to confirm if the level of THC stated on the label was correct and that the product was uncontaminated without independent expert testing. The TGA said evidence about the effectiveness of medicinal cannabis on different medical conditions was limited. Little is also known about the most suitable doses of individual cannabis products. Advertising medicinal cannabis products to consumers in Australia is also illegal and doing so can lead to heavy fines and/or jail. “Any advertising that claims a medicinal cannabis product can treat cancer, mental illness, epilepsy or any other serious condition is likely to be breaking the law, even if the advertiser believes there is evidence to support the claim. These rules protect vulnerable consumers,” the TGA said. In December, a man was given four fines totalling $10,656 for alleged unlawful advertising of cannabidiol (CBD).

The move, announced by Health Minister Greg Hunt, will boost local supply and loosen importation laws and means patients will no longer have to wait months to access it for medical use. It will also be easier for patients who now must go through a lengthy process to get cannabis from overseas once prescribed by an authorised doctor. But this doesn’t mean everyone can light up in celebration — because not just anyone can get it. “We want to make supply available but it has to be legal,” Mr Hunt said.  “It has to be safe and we want to make sure this medicinal cannabis is available but on the same basis as any of the serious drugs and medicines that can only be dealt with through prescription and through a very rigorous medical process.”  Here’s what it all means for you.  GREEN LIGHT The Federal Government has given the green light for approved companies to legally import, store and sell the drug until domestic production meets local needs.  Last year the government passed laws to legalise medicinal cannibal use for patients with painful and chronic conditions with products imported from overseas. Under the new changes, approved importers will now be able to buy the medication from overseas and store it in Australia for immediate distribution until domestic production meets local needs.  The move will make it easier for patients who now must wait for the product to be imported once prescribed an authorised doctor. Strict rules and regulations surrounding the drug remain in place, meaning not just anyone can access it. Currently the drug is sourced from overseas but the changes would see it cultivated locally with imports fast-tracked while local supplies are grown.  WHERE TO FROM HERE? It is expected Australia will have a store of imported medicinal cannabis products within eight weeks. That is expected to help fill the gap until local production — which was legalised late last year — ramps up. But Mr Hunt said local production will take time to develop. Once approved, commercial importers will be allowed to source medicinal cannabis products from a reputable international supplier and store it in a secure warehouse. The first licence for private cultivation was only issued last week. Victoria expects locally-sourced medicinal cannabis to be available by the middle of the year or a little bit later.  The health minister said those with profound conditions or palliative care needs will instead be able to access safe, high-quality and appropriately-obtained medication within days.  “It is time that they have the care that they need, the drugs that are prescribed by medical professionals, and that they are actually available,” he said.  WHO BENEFITS? According to Katoomba-based GP Teresa Towpik, the benefits could extend beyond ill patients.  Speaking to news.com.au, Dr Towpik said the drug could be grown locally, which could have massive rewards for farmers, distributors and even pickers. “Why are we importing it, when we could grow own ethically sourced drug here?” she said. The GP, who admits she comes from a conservative background, said she was excited by the benefits the drug could have for patients who previously had to wait a long time for treatment. But she said more education was needed and it wasn’t a case of “people smoking bongs” whenever they wanted. Dr Towpik, who will give a talk on the potential benefits of the drug at Australia’s Hemp Health & Innovation (HHI) Expo & Symposium 2017 in May, said patients still had to undergo a full assessment and not just anyone could be prescribed medical marijuana. “I’m very excited by this,” she said. “I really feel this has tremendous benefits for patients, especially those with chronic pain, as well as providing pain relief for cancer patients. “I’m quite amazed at the potential it has but know many GPs remain cautious. I think it’s worth looking into further.”  HOW DO YOU GET IT? Dr Towpik said not just anyone was entitled to the drug and patients had to undergo a rigorous assessment to obtain it. Patients require a letter from their GP, and must also get an importation permit from the Therapeutic Goods Administration. “There’s a lot of paperwork involved, so it’s not as easy as it may sound,” she said. She also said not all GPs would feel comfortable prescribing it. Dr Towpik said along with eduction of both doctors and patients, there also had to be an easy streamlined process involved from prescribing down to distribution. “There is still a lot of learning to be done,” she said.  HOW IS IT TAKEN? Dr Towpik said patients who used the drug took it as an oil or vaporiser form. “It shouldn’t be smoked, that can increase bronchial irritations and reduce the potency,” she said.  debra.killalea@news.com.au To join the conversation, please

Children’s health advocate Katrina Spraggon has been described as an unsung hero for her fight in shining the light on access to medicinal cannabis for children. The Queensland mother of four, from Ningi, has taken her battle to a state and federal level and also received global support. Her 12-year-old disabled daughter Kaitlyn uses cannabis oil for pain and to prevent severe seizures. Despite cannabis oil becoming more widely available, Ms Spraggon said no commercially available product was similar to the homemade recipe she brewed for Kaitlyn. “We take one day at a time and have been receiving support from all around the world,” she said. “The issue involves a lot of people who can’t afford it but would benefit from the treatment being on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.” Ms Spraggon’s efforts have earned her a Thanks A Million campaign nomination from consultant and friend Linda Howard, who works in community relations and Indigenous affairs management. She wrote in her submission: “Despite her own personal challenges, Katrina has tirelessly advocated both on a state and federal level, to change laws to allow doctors to prescribe cannabis medicine to children with these severe neurological conditions.  “Katrina continues to push for greater access, more research and better health outcomes for children, Australia wide. “The time and effort and heart Katrina puts into this cause has had a significant impact on government policy, with greater access to this medicine potentially saving and giving greater quality of life to thousands of Australian children.  “Katrina is everything the best mothers are made of, and the best Australians; she thinks of others, no matter how hard times are for her, she fights for the little guy, the little battler – and is willing to take on giants to do so.  “Katrina is an unsung hero who I believe deserves recognition and thanks.” The Thanks A Million Pride of Australia awards recognise those who have gone above and beyond to help their fellow Australians through the challenges of 2020.

EXCLUSIVE Chronically ill Australians desperately trying to access medicinal cannabis could soon be given a helping hand. Melbourne-based medicinal cannabis company Montu has created a nationwide network of doctors who support the use of controversial cannabidiol (CBD) as a treatment and can help more than half a million patients access the drug for a range of medical conditions, regardless of their location. It will come as a welcome relief for thousands of Australians including Melbourne mother Annee Angell, whose daughter Lindsey has epilepsy.  Ms Angell said it had been an ongoing battle to find the right treatment for her 40-year-old, blind and non-verbal daughter, who would feel the debilitating effects of seizures for days after an episode. Speaking to NCA NewsWire, Ms Angell said she discovered CBD four years ago, but she was forced to seek out a “backdoor supplier” in a bid to treat her daughter’s lifelong and “unpredictable” condition because the product was illegal. “I couldn’t consult my GP because I feared I would get in trouble,” she said.  MAKING ACCESS EASIER Medicinal cannabis was legalised in Victoria (the first state to do so) in 2016, but even Lindsey’s neurologist refused to prescribe it. “I asked for a prescription but he flat out refused because he feared he would become ‘the guy’ and be inundated with CBD prescription requests,” Ms Angell said. The 75-year-old managed to get her hands on a CBD paste through the backdoor supplier and tried some herself to ensure she didn’t experience any side effects before giving it to Lindsey. She went from having four seizures every week to just one on average.  Ms Angell said eventually a GP provided Lindsey with a prescription but only a small dose of 4mg a day, but she required at least 40mg to reduce her seizures.  “I felt like he was too nervous to give her a higher dose because he didn’t really understand CBD,” she said. “Doctors and pharmacists are scared of it. The biggest problem is the stereotype that it gets you high.  “This is not true - I would never put Lindsey in that condition.” Only 5 per cent of GPs are prescribing cannabis medication despite 84 per cent of Australians supporting medicinal legalisation, according to Montu. Melbourne man Joseph Stringer, 37, is one of the many Australians pushing for greater accessibility. Mr Stringer is a recovering cancer patient and first heard about CBD on a TV news segment but was “too afraid” to ask his doctor for help. “My problems changed after chemotherapy. My white blood cells now give me trouble, which has led to pain in my legs and feet. It’s gotten so bad that I’ve lost mobility in my feet,” he said. After years of having to pump his body with strong painkillers, generally containing opioid, which is notoriously addictive, Mr Stringer was approached to take part in a clinical study, examining the effect of CBD on chronic pain. “I vividly remember sitting down on the couch after my first dose and realising I was no longer in pain. I had mobility in my foot which I couldn’t believe and neither could my doctors,” he said.  MEDICAL BODY SCEPTICAL BUT GP OFFERS PRAISE Dr Joel Wren, who practises from the AHA Seaford Day and Night Clinic in South Australia, has been prescribing medicinal cannabis to patients for a little over a year. His said Lindsey and Mr Stringer’s struggle to gain access to medicinal cannabis was not uncommon. “It’s absolutely awful people have to rely on these black market sources,” Dr Wren told NCA NewsWire. “The overall understanding of what medicinal cannabis is is still very limited in the wider community where a lot of patients are getting the wrong idea.” Dr Wren has faith the medicine will become more readily available within the next few years but fears the stigma attached to CBD could stand in its way. “The stigma has contaminated discussion from day one,” he said. “Until the late 20th century, cannabis was only seen in the dependency section of medical textbooks. “There was a very poor understanding of the inherent value of it as a treatment. It’s still very new for a lot of doctors.” CBD is a non-intoxicating component of the hemp plant. It’s the second most prevalent of the active ingredients in cannabis (marijuana) and is currently listed as a Schedule 4 “prescription-only medicine”. Patients who want to use CBD products have to find a doctor who is familiar with the process of applying through the Therapeutic Goods Association (TGA) special access scheme to legally prescribe it to them. But first, a referral needs to be put forward by a doctor on a patient’s behalf and it must show they have a medical reason for accessing CBD. An Australian Medical Association (AMA) spokesperson told NCA NewsWire it supported clinical trials and recognised the drug’s therapeutic benefits but said it had its limits. “There is evidence that it may assist in some specialised neurological conditions, including paediatric epilepsy, in multiple sclerosis, and the body wasting that goes along with HIV and chemotherapy, but it is not the panacea for all and, in particular, it has a very limited role in treating pain,” the organisation said. “It is likely that medicinal cannabis will have a significant but very small role to play in treating difficult cases.” The organisation claims only a small portion of patients would be suitable for medicinal cannabis treatment but recognises there are several roadblocks for doctors who want to prescribe the medication that need to change. “The time needed for training and accreditation, and the lack of clear, current prescribing guidelines from jurisdiction to jurisdiction are deterrents to becoming an authorised prescriber,” the AMA said. “The process for approving medicinal cannabis remains unclear.” Earlier this month, the TGA flagged making the medication available over the counter, without the need for a prescription, as early as next year. But there’s a catch – the restricted maximum dose would be just 60mg. The TGA is taking public comment about amending the Poisons Standard until October 13.  A final decision will be made in November.  erin.lyons@news.com.au A search is currently underway in a state’s high country, where an Irish hiker has reportedly been missing for days.

Australia is poised to become a leader in medicinal cannabis after a landmark $92m deal with the European Union, the Health Minister says. The first batch of Australian grown dried medicinal cannabis has been sent to Europe, with two tonnes of it to be shipped to Germany over the next 18 months.  It’s the first stage of a 10-year deal struck between the Australian Natural Therapeutics Group (ANTG) and the EU.  ANTG has become the first Australian grower to access the burgeoning EU market, which is on track to become the world’s largest legal market. Health Minister Greg Hunt predicted strong growth in the medicinal cannabis industry over the next 12 months, saying Australia is well placed to take advantage.  “Australia’s gold-standard regulation of medicinal cannabis products, coupled with a premium agricultural and manufacturing industry, means we are well positioned to become a preferred supplier to the global market,” he said. “This has the potential to create jobs and boost economic growth in Australia as we look to new and different export channels.” In Germany alone, where the average price for a gram ranges between $8-11, cannabis is projected to become a $12.4bn industry by 2028.  ANTG chief executive officer Matt Cantelo said high-quality benchmarks set in Australia would “keep the cowboys out of the industry”, describing the deal as “a major win” for the country’s cannabis producers.  “While the German cannabis industry is still in its infancy, it is the third largest market globally behind the US and Canada,” he said. “Now that we have the gold standard in growing and manufacturing medicinal cannabis – in line with the most stringent in the world – it means our product also qualifies for export to every other nation.” But Mr Cantelo said the company would always prioritise Australian patients, with the release of NSW’s first locally grown medicinal cannabis extract just weeks away.  Medicinal cannabis is heavily restricted in Australia but can be prescribed if deemed clinically appropriate.  The Therapeutic Goods Association granted 25,182 applications from Australian doctors to prescribe the product in 2019.

PATIENTS who need medicinal cannabis to control epilepsy, pain and nausea will have to wait months before a national licensing scheme allows it to be grown here. Six weeks after announcing a licensing scheme to manage the supply of locally grown medicinal cannabis, Health Minister Sussan Ley has returned to the drawing board. Instead of allowing the states to set up individual cultivation schemes, as she announced in October, the Minister now says she wants a single national cultivation scheme run by the Commonwealth Government. In October, the government promised it would bring legislation to set up a cultivation scheme “to parliament by the end of the year”. With just one parliamentary sitting day left, she is now promising “in consultation with state and territory Governments, to introduce legislation in the first sitting period of 2016”. “I am confident creating one single, nationally-consistent cultivation scheme, rather than eight individual arrangements, will not only help speed up the legislative process, but ultimately access to medicinal cannabis products as well,” Ms Ley said. Medicinal cannabis advocate Lucy Haslam has described the delay as “very disappointing”. “I’m fairly cynical, I don’t think the federal government has shown any leadership in this space,” she said. “To leave it until the last week of parliament is very disappointing, now they are talking a year and a half away,” she said. Lucy Haslam’s 25 year-old-son Dan was using cannabis to relieve nausea, vomiting and poor appetite caused by chemotherapy until he lost his battle with bowel cancer earlier this year. When the minister’s office contacted her yesterday they told her it would be 2017 before locally grown cannabis would be in the hands of patients, she said. “To me that is abject failure,” she said. Victorian mum Cheri O’Connell whose daughter Tara uses medicinal cannabis to control up to 500 epileptic seizures a day says “it’s upsetting that nothing is moving fast enough”. “Every delay is another child’s death,” she said. “A child in Bendigo died the other day and there are over 1000 kids using it illegally now,” she said. The Victorian Government will next week press ahead and introduce into State Parliament its own legislation to allow the cultivation and trial of medicinal cannabis. A spokeswoman for the state’s Health Minister Jill Hennessy said she was hoping the Federal Government would fast-track the Victorian cultivation licenses ahead of the introduction of the national scheme. “The Andrews Labor Government welcomes any move by the Commonwealth to establish a single nationally consistent scheme as this will create greater certainty and more access to medicinal cannabis for the families and children that need it the most,” Ms Hennessy said.  “However given the Commonwealth’s timelines on this continue to change, we are not prepared to delay the introduction of our legislation at the expense of the Victorian families and children that are desperately awaiting this much need reform,’ the minister said.  “I’ve seen first-hand the difference medicinal cannabis has made to the lives of children suffering from severe epilepsy and my priority is to ensure we can deliver on our promise so we can help these families as soon as possible, that why we’ll be pressing ahead with our own legislation this year.”  A spokesman for Federal Health Minister Ley said the new draft law would not restrict the type of cannabis that could be grown but suppliers would have to prove they had a market for their product — such as a clinical trial or a Therapeutic Goods Administration-approved manufacturer — before they could get a licence. Shadow Assistant Minister for Health Stephen Jones said he “welcomes the government’s decision to adopt Labor’s policy to have a single national scheme to regulate the cultivation of medicinal cannabis”. However he urged the Government to go further and create a truly national scheme for medicinal cannabis that doesn’t leave people in some states and territories unable to legally and safely access the product. “Under the Minister for Health’s plan, a person’s postcode will still determine whether or not they will be at risk of prosecution for possession and use of medicinal cannabis,” Mr Jones said. “As things stand, it is still up to the states and territories to decriminalise the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes and there is no guarantee they will adopt uniform national laws.” To join the conversation, please

Medicinal cannabis start-up Cann Group has been given a major financing boost and says it now has enough cash to build a production facility in Victoria. The company said on Monday it had received credit approval from National Australia Bank for a $50 million secured debt facility, with documentation expected to be complete within the next month.  Cann Group will use the loan to complete the first stage of its production site near Mildura, with work expected to recommence in February. The company has already spent about $53 million on site works and a greenhouse and support building. The total cost of the first stage is estimated to be $112 million. Cann Group secured a Victorian Government development grant of $1.95 million in July and the rest of the costs will be paid out of cash reserves. Product is slated to start being processed and released by March 2022. The company says 130 new jobs will be created once the facility is commissioned but it will use specialist overseas contractors for the construction, and they have been cleared to arrive in Australia in the new year. The first stage of the project will have annual production capacity of 12,500kg of dry flower equivalent, using technology that the company says will allow it to be sold at a globally competitive price. “Securing the support of a tier one bank is a strong validation of our strategic growth plans,” chief executive Peter Crock said.  “Given the building demand for our products, we have the confidence to immediately ramp up production as soon as the facility is ready.” Cann Group has a manufacturing partnership with Melbourne-based IDT Australia and together they produced the first batches of cannabis resin along with dried cannabis flower and cannabis oil last financial year.

MEDICINAL cannabis could rival the state’s $100 million poppy industry if given the green light, the Opposition says, as the State Government finally throws its support behind a trial. Tasmanian Health Minister Michael Ferguson said yesterday he supported a trial, reversing a stance in July which rejected the move on health, social and security grounds. “We support appropriately conducted clinical trials, feeding into the existing national medicines regulatory framework,” Mr Ferguson said. “We will objectively consider any proposal regarding a trial of medicinal cannabis on a case-by-case basis.” An Upper House committee is examining legalised medicinal cannabis and the Government has made its submission. Shadow attorney-general Lara Giddings welcomed the change of heart, saying it could reap enormous economic benefits to rival the lucrative poppy industry — a claim disputed by poppy growers. “There is huge economic potential for Tasmania, if it becomes the state that grows medicinal cannabis, just like opium poppies, but I was concerned the door for business was slammed shut by the Government’s earlier rejection,” Ms Giddings said.  “But we hope the door can be reopened, allowing farmers to grow a rotational crop creating medicine to help the lives of people suffering from chronic illness.”  “There is huge economic potential for Tasmania, if it becomes the state that grows medicinal cannabis, just like opium poppies.” The Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association has welcomed the move, fearing the state could be left behind by NSW and Victoria, which were moving to legalise medicinal cannabis.  TFGA chief Jan Davis said farmers were keen for a logical process to be followed. “We only have one go at this, and it will take time to review the rules and regulations, so farmers can grow it without fear,” she said.  Tasmanian Poppy Growers president Glynn Williams said the growth of medicinal cannabis could damage Tasmania’s reputation for safe and secure narcotics production.  Mr Williams also rejected Labor’s estimation of the potential size of any future industry. “It would be incredibly small, it’s never going to be a crop for farmers,” he said.  He also feared the medicinal cannabis push would undermine efforts to set up an industrial hemp industry in Tasmania which he said would provide a broadacre option for farmers.  Victorian Oppo­sition Leader Daniel ­Andrews has thrown his party’s support behind medicinal cannabis. If elected at the November 29 election, Mr Andrews said the Victorian Law Reform Commission would be asked to investigate the prescription, manufacture and distribution of medicinal cannabis.  Meantime, the Legislative Council inquiry into medicinal cannabis has been flooded with support from Tasmanians because of the reported relief it can give from pain, nausea and vomiting from cancer treatments, and chronic conditions such as epilepsy and multiple sclerosis.  Independent MLC Ruth Forrest said more than 100 submissions had been received with hearings set to begin within a fortnight. Growing the valuable crop is championed by all 12 mayors from southern Tasmania. Mr Ferguson said any government support for the medicinal use of cannabis would be based on strong evidence and regulation. “This is a complex issue that requires research and evidence,” he said.  Greens’ health spokeswoman Cassy O’Connor said Mr Ferguson had clearly bowed to public and political pressure for medicinal cannabis.

A mum has broken down in tears after her supply of medicinal cannabis for her severely epileptic daughter was confiscated by authorities at an airport in the UK. Emma Appleby, and her daughter Teagan, 9, were travelling back to Britain from Holland carrying a three month’s supply of medical cannabis oil, valued at $8,400 where it was seized after they landed at Southend Airport in Essex.  Teagan, who has a rare chromosomal disorder as well as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, can suffer up to 300 seizures a day if she is left untreated. She suffered a seizure while on the plane, reports ITV News. Appleby, an avid campaigner for the legalisation of medicinal cannabis, said she was “devastated” that she wasn’t allowed to enter the UK with the appropriate medicine for her child after collecting it from a pharmacy in Rotterdam using their own and fundraised money.  “I’m devastated. I’ve always tried to do the right thing. I’ve jumped through all the hoops but ended up being passed from pillar to post and being met with a flat ‘no’,” she said. “All I want is the best thing for my daughter. “I’ll fight to get it back.” Policy reforms made last November aimed to make access to medical cannabis legal but parents in the UK have reportedly been struggling to secure prescriptions, in part due to the reluctance resonating from the medical community.   Ms Appleby claims she had no choice but to take matters into her own hands by seeking medical cannabis outside of the UK, only to return to have it all taken from her.  “I’m really gutted,” she said. “They just took everything.”  Ms Appleby suspects authorities at the airport had been informed of her arrival, most likely through social media. “They knew apparently, they have been notified from social media.  “I hadn’t said where we were coming in but obviously everyone knew, all you’ve got to do is put it on the passport. “They asked me at border control how long we were away for. “I thought, ‘They’re asking questions as if someone’s notified them’. “Then they asked if I had anything to declare, there were loads of them waiting so I knew if I said no I was going to get myself in deeper so I just yes.” Border staff were told not to destroy the medicine but to seize it and hold it, and Ms Appleby hopes to apply for an import licence to get it back.  A government spokesman said: “The decision to prescribe cannabis-based products for medicinal use is a clinical decision for specialist hospital doctors, made with patients and their families, taking into account clinical guidance. “It is unlawful to import unlicensed cannabis-based products for medicinal use to the UK without the prescription of a specialist doctor and a Home Office importation licence.  “Border Force has a duty to enforce the law and stop the unlawful import of controlled substances into the UK”.

The multi-million dollar research grant will be used to look at how cannabis can help treat cancer pain and other side effects.

Mr Hunt made the announcement this morning with Olivia Newton-John who is in Melbourne for her Wellness Walk and Research Run.

Over the counter medicinal cannabis could be available in Australia from next year. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has released a notice of interim decisions on proposed amendments to the Poisons Standard, which could give the green light for access to cannabidiol without a prescription at pharmacies. Cannabidiol or CBD is the second most prevalent of the active ingredients in cannabis (marijuana) and is currently listed as a Schedule 4 “prescription only medicine”. In relation to one proposed amendment, the TGA made an interim decision to “down schedule cannabidiol to allow greater access … in accordance with specified requirements and with additional supply requirements … to allow it to be provided by a pharmacist.” The document, published on Wednesday, raised a suggested implementation date of June 2021. As of September 3, the TGA had approved special access applications to medicinal cannabis products for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, refractory paediatric epilepsy, palliative care indications, cancer pain, neuropathic pain, spasticity from neurological conditions and anorexia and wasting associated with chronic illness (such as cancer). “The (Advisory) Committee noted that currently there are no registered CBD products in Australia and unapproved CBD products are accessed via the Special Access Scheme,” the interim decision states. The products would need to include warning statements or safety directions such as “do not use” if pregnant and/or breastfeeding or when likely to become pregnant or plan to breastfeed. Limitations on the cannabidiol include a maximum daily dose of 60mg and no more than 30 days’ supply of CBD.  PROPOSED NEW ENTRY IN POISONS STANDARD CBD would be down scheduled to a Schedule 3 product in oral, oral mucosal and sublingual formulations (under the tongue) preparations for therapeutic use, as per the following criteria:  * the cannabidiol is either plant derived, or when synthetic only contains the (-) CBD enantiomer * the maximum recommended daily dose is 60 mg or less of cannabidiol * in packs containing not more than 30 days’ supply * cannabidiol comprises 98 per cent or more of the total cannabinoid content of the preparation * any cannabinoids, other than cannabidiol, must be only those naturally found in cannabis and comprise 2 per cent or less of the total cannabinoid content of the preparation * for adults aged 18 years and over * packed in blister or strip packaging or in a container fitted with a child-resistant closure Supply would also be limited to medicines that are entered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, the TGA document states. The potential “major regulatory change” was welcomed by Althea Group, an ASX-listed Australian licensed producer, supplier and exporter of pharmaceutical grade medicinal cannabis. “We applaud the TGA’s interim decision in this matter and see it as one of the biggest developments in our industry to date,” chief executive Josh Fegan said in a statement, describing it as a “big step forward”. “The interim decision reflects the significant shift in community and government attitudes towards medicinal cannabis since it was legalised in Australia in late 2016, which has seen it move from a fringe alternative towards an accepted mainstream option.” The TGA states consultation closes on October 13, 2020.  A search is currently underway in a state’s high country, where an Irish hiker has reportedly been missing for days.

THE results are in — overwhelmingly Australians wants access to medicinal cannabis. Chronic Pain Australia had no intention of asking the community their thoughts on the controversial treatment when they conducted research released this week. But the organisation that helps one in five Australians living with chronic pain was bombarded with responses from people calling for their GPs to be able to easily prescribe it to them to treat their debilitating ailments. Dr Coralie Wales, president of Chronic Pain Australia, said medicinal cannabis was a common theme in the results, with 75 per cent of people who took part in their annual National Pain Week survey wanting the drug to help treat their pain. “For many people living with 24/7 pain, current medical options come with side-effects that can be quite disabling in themselves,” she said. “Overwhelmingly they want access to other options. “Medicinal cannabis represents a new possibility to help treat their chronic pain. “What we’re hearing is that people living with chronic pain want simpler access, without feeling like criminals.”  READ MORE: Cannabis edibles being popped among Sydneysiders A recent study — the world’s longest into cannabis and opioids to treat pain — found that the drug might not actually be as beneficial as people think. While researchers found most people “perceived it to help”, in reality, it didn’t really change their level of pain. However, Dr Wales said such research did not change what Australians were telling them. Worldwide interest in the area has been growing, particularly for chronic non-cancer pain. In Australia, one in five GP consultations involve a patient with chronic pain and almost five per cent of patients visiting a GP report severe, disabling chronic pain. The prevalence of chronic pain is projected to increase as Australia’s population ages — from about 3.2 million in 2007 to five million by 2050. Dr Wales said their survey also found people felt there was a disconnect between themselves and healthcare professionals, and that their pain was not believed or understood by the wider community. She said that was because pain was often an “invisible illness”. Nearly all respondents said they did not feel that the Australian Government was doing enough to support people living with chronic pain and 86 per cent said they faced stigma or negative attitudes.  They also said seeing health professionals other than their GP was too expensive, and 70 per cent disagreed with the Australian Government’s decision to up-schedule codeine. “People living with chronic pain face a daily battle, fighting physical pain, mental health issues, and the subsequent financial pressures of being unable to work to their full capacity,” Dr Coralie Wales said.  “Feeling unsupported by the government, and being discriminated against, judged or not believed by friends, family and work colleagues can make their situation even more difficult to cope with.” This National Pain Week, Chronic Pain Australia is calling on GPs, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals to consider the experiences of people living with chronic pain before making changes or moving forward with any policy or treatment initiatives.  They want the government to work with them to identify ways to better assist and improve the lives of the millions of Australians living with chronic pain.

A TASMANIAN mother who says a cannabinoid tincture cured her daughter’s seizures has taken the medication in front of Premier Will Hodgman in a bid to show him it has no side effects. Nicole Cowles has told a Parliamentary committee looking into a medicinal cannabis trial in Tasmania that she took the medication in Mr Hodgman’s presence on Saturday. “This drug is a very safe,” Ms Cowles said. “There are very few side effects. “It should not be a schedule nine drug.” The calls came as Mr Hodgman told Tasmanian Parliament he was willing to take the issue to the next COAG meeting in Canberra. Ms Cowles said she had searched for nine years, and tried 10 to 15 medications, for a product that would help to cure her daughter’s seizures. “I want to be able to tell people that this is a miracle but you can’t because it sounds like you are selling snake oil,” she said. Ms Cowles said she wanted the product to be regulated, particularly for children. “I am fairly sure I’m getting a safe product at the moment,” she said. “But season to season, batch to batch it can be variable. “That is why we need to have a best practice model.” Eric Ratcliff, representing the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists said there were links between cannabis and schizophrenia. “We are not hostile to the idea of medicinal cannabis,” he said. “But there is a concern that much of the evidence that has become public is anecdotal.” Dr Ratcliff said it was important an analysis of all available evidence was established as part of a trial. “Approximately one in 10 of us inherit the genes that make us susceptible to schizophrenia,” he said. “The use of cannabis in adolescence greatly enhances the risk of a disorder.” He said there are fears the Parliamentary inquiry was assisting a theory “that this is a safe drug without dangers, but that it is not the case”. matthew.smith@news.com.au Originally published as Tasmanian mother defends medicinal cannabis, takes tincture in front of Premier Will Hodgman To join the conversation, please

DESPERATE cancer patients are paying up to $220 for one day’s supply of black market medicinal cannabis while awaiting the “frustratingly slow” process of legalisation. Health experts say there is enough scientifically proven benefit to warrant the drug’s legalisation in Australia. But state governments have ordered trials despite more than 1600 research papers already completed around the world. Scientists say medicinal cannabis eases nausea in chemotherapy patients, assists with pain and muscle spasticity and stimulates appetite in cancer and HIV patients. Certain cannabis substances have also been found to kill cancer cells in the lab. “I believe there is heaps of research out there if people take the trouble to read it they will find the research is more than adequate,” said Emeritus Professor Laurence Mather from the University of Sydney. Medicinal cannabis supplier Langdon Brown, also known as The Don, said he had 150 customers in Queensland taking cannabis oil for conditions like cancer, epilepsy and chronic pain. He said supply was difficult because growers were reluctant to have more than six plants for legal reasons. PALASZCZUK: Queensland to trial medicinal marijuana One millilitre of Mr Langdon’s cannabis oil sells for $110 which he said could last about one month for a patient taking one drop per day. But he recommended cancer patients consume 2ml a day for two months equating to $220 a day or $13,200 for two months. “If medicinal cannabis was legalised, prices would come down 50 per cent guaranteed,” Mr Langdon said. The Queensland Government has ordered trials of medical cannabis for children with epilepsy which could start next year. Health Minister Cameron Dick said Queensland Health was looking into the global research “to see if we can accelerate the process. We want to ensure any medical cannabis product used by children is safe and effective”.  Meanwhile Greens, LNP, Labor and Liberal Democrat senators have co-sponsored a forthcoming Bill to regulate the growing, manufacturing and distribution of medicinal cannabis nationally. Bill co-sponsor and Greens Leader Senator Richard Di Natale said there was “already overwhelming international evidence that medicinal cannabis can provide relief from certain conditions. Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy have been needlessly denied access to this kind of medical relief for far too long”. The Australian Medical Association, which recognises the therapeutic potential of cannabis, backs more clinical trials.  President of the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation, Dr Alex Wodak AM, said people were suffering while “slow progress” was made towards legalising medical marijuana. He said many terminal patients were forced onto the black market, fearing legal repercussions. “I’m all in favour of being slow and careful but it seems hard to justify the rate of progress,” said Dr Wodak.

Cannabis is keeping her alive and there’s nothing her mother won’t do to ensure it stays that way. BEFORE Tara O’Connell started taking medical marijuana, she used to have up to 200 seizures a day, with doctors saying she would not live to see her ninth birthday. That Tara will not only celebrate this milestone on Friday, but that she has also been seizure-free for more than a year, is undoubtedly linked to use of a tincture made from cannabis plants, her mother Cheri O’Connell says. Now the mother-of-three says she is willing to start a class action against the government to ensure her daughter’s supply. She is one of hundreds, if not thousands, of people she believes are willing to fight back against laws outlawing marijuana in Australia. “I will not stop, I will not let my child die because our government is 15 years behind the rest of the world,” Ms O’Connell said. “If something doesn’t give, I will launch a class action against the government. “Hundreds, if not thousands, are being denied medication that could save lives.” Ms O’Connell said the family had tried everything to relieve Tara’s rare condition, a fatal form of epilepsy called Dravet syndrome, and at one stage she was taking 18 tablets a day. “If you looked at an EEG it showed she was having seizures every five to 20 seconds,” Ms O’Connell said. “We tried everything, in the end they told us to take her home and love her because there was nothing left to try.”. Doctors advised Ms O’Connell in December 2012 that her daughter would not live to see her ninth birthday. Tara’s miraculous turnaround came about only after she started taking the tincture on Australia Day, 2013. She has been seizure-free since April 3 of that year. A drop of the tincture is placed under Tara’s tongue and the medicine has been manufactured to be low in THC, which is the compound that produces a “high”. Ms O’Connell said her daughter, who used to struggle to walk and used a wheelchair, has improved so much that she is “walking, talking, reading, things we thought she would never do”. She is also giving the tincture to her son Sean, 12, who has a less severe form of epilepsy and is also seizure-free. Mrs O’Connell said she was grateful for the new life that her children could now experience. “I personally know of 13 kids who have died of epilepsy in the past year to 18 months,” she said. Medical marijuana could possibly help these children, and those dealing with conditions such as cancer, Multiple Sclerosis, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and other chronic pain or post-traumatic disorders. In a controversial step, one of Australia’s largest nursing unions came out last weekend in support of the use and possession of medical cannabis. The NSW Nurses and Midwives Association general secretary Brett Holmes said its 59,000 strong membership had recognised the importance of exploring options for pain management. The union has signed a petition started by NSW resident Lucy Haslam, whose 24-year-old son Daniel has also been using cannabis to help deal with the side effects of chemotherapy to treat his terminal bowel cancer.  The NSW government has faced increasing criticism from experts for rejecting the findings of a cross party committee last year that recommended legalising cannabis for the terminally ill. Nationals MP Kevin Anderson said last month he wanted to introduce a private members bill to legalise cannabis for terminally-ill patients. He met with Premier Mike Baird to discuss this and afterwards Mr Baird said that his government would give “careful consideration” to the proposal. Over the weekend the NSW Health Minister Jillian Skinner finally came out in support of a proposed trial of medical cannabis, but not in NSW. “I am advised there is a proposal seeking approval to extract the non-hallucinogenic component from cannabis grown in Tasmania with a view to clinical trials to prove its safety and effectiveness. I support this approach,” Ms Skinner said. Tasmanian company Tasman Health Cannabinoids has applied for a licence to grow cannabis to conduct a clinical study in conjunction with the University of Tasmania. But Tony Bower, who has been producing the tincture that Ms O’Connell uses, has been trying to get a licence to produce it legally in NSW since 2008. The founder of Mullaways Medical Cannabis Pty Ltd said his application had been tied up in red tape but he had still been supplying — for free — the tincture to more than 150 families. This supply is now at risk because police have charged Mr Bower with cultivation. But support for medical marijuana seems to be growing in NSW with a former “tough on drugs” federal police commissioner Mick Palmer backing it as well as radio host Alan Jones. The Cancer Council’s Hunter regional manager Shayne Connell is calling for a “mature debate”, while Victoria’s peak medical body AMA Victoria as well as Epilepsy Australia have also backed the call for further research. Medicinal cannabis is legal in Canada, Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, Israel, Italy and in some states of the US. Ms O’Connell urged people to support a change in the laws in Australia and to contact their local MPs. “It may not be a cure all for every person but they should be able to give the chance to try it,” Ms O’Connell said. People can also sign the online petition started by Lucy Haslam calling on the NSW Health Minister to decriminalise the use of medicinal cannabis for people with terminal cancer.

MEDICAL cannabis could soon be easier to get for terminally-ill Australians after passing a first hurdle in Parliament today.  A bid by the Australian Greens to give terminally-ill patients quicker, easier access to doctor-prescribed medicinal cannabis, by allowing access under the Therapeutic Goods Administration category A list, passed the upper house today.  It will now go before the lower house, where the government controls the numbers.  During debate today, Liberal Democrats senator Senator Leyonhjelm said the Turnbull Government had “blood on its hands” for not making access easier.  “They are responsible for terrible unnecessary suffering and very likely a number of premature deaths,” he said.  Patients can already get the drug under category B, but senator Leyonhjelm said the bureaucratic process made access too slow.  “The government and its Health Department officials have blood on their hands,” he said.  Greens leader Richard Di Natale, who proposed the bill, urged government MPs to cross the floor in the lower house to pass the changes.  “It is simple cruelty from this government,” he said. “These patients are dying and their doctors believe medicinal cannabis may alleviate their suffering, but the government is stopping them from getting it.”  But Liberal senator Dean Smith dismissed concerns about wait times, saying the approval process could take a day.  “The Australian community should trust the advice of the government, which is informed by specialist medical practitioners,” Senator Smith said. One Nation leader Pauline Hanson called on the government to stop making criminals of caring mums and dads by allowing access to the “miracle drug”.  Independent senator Derryn Hinch said the government’s position was a disgrace.  “I don’t give a damn that they are thwarting the will of the Senate, they are thwarting the will and the rights of sick people in Australia,” Senator Hinch said.  In June, the Senate voted to scrap rules which made it harder for dying patients to access medical cannabis, prompting the government to tell importers to ignore the decision.

MEDICINAL cannabis producers are on a high after the Australian government gave them approval to begin exports. By 1344 AEDT on Thursday, shares in Cann Group were up 27.8 per cent at $3.68, The Hydroponics Company had gained 22.4 per cent to 87.5 cents, and AusCann had soared passed a dollar for the first time, up 31.1 per cent to $1.075.  Distributor Bod Australia also hit record highs in early trading — and was still up 24.4 per cent to 53.5 cents — after inking a manufacturing and commercialisation agreement with pharmaceutical company iX Biopharma Limited to develop a cannabis wafer product. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt on Thursday said granting the export of medicinal cannabis products was “an important step” for the development of the sector and to secure long-term supplies for Australian patients.  “This decision will help both the domestic supply and Australian producers by strengthening the opportunities for domestic manufacturers,” Mr Hunt said in a statement. He said allowing the export of medicinal cannabis product will also help the developing domestic market to grow further, amid increasing competition from imports. Cann chief executive Peter Crock welcomed the news, which will allow the company to set up at a global scale. “I think we are seeing there is a global shortage so there is going to be room for multiple players,” Mr Crock said. He said Cann is well placed to remain at the forefront of the industry, thanks to a $78 million capital raising that will support expansion and ensure it has capacity to meet local and export needs. “We have got an expansion plan that we went to market and raised capital specifically for that and it really allows confidence to move forward,” he said.  The federal government in 2016 legalised patient access to Australian-grown and manufactured medicinal cannabis, subject to state and territory regulations. Victoria in 2016 became Australia’s first state to legalise cannabis for medical use, quickly followed by NSW. AusCann managing director Elaine Darby described the decision as a win for Australian companies and patients. “This will really strengthen the industry, enabling it to supply Australian patients — in addition to international patients — with high quality, cost-effective cannabinoid medicines,” Ms Darby said on Thursday.  “It will allow the Australian medical cannabis industry to scale up to a certain size and stability, making it easier to produce more cost effective products in a shorter amount of time.” The latest round of retail spending figures is expected to give the RBA board pause for thought in their April meeting. Smaller banks are offering attractive interest rates to new customers, but the reality is likely very different for existing customers.

But now it’s set to explode into a billion-dollar industry. AUSTRALIA is about to see an explosion of capital investment in a product that, up until recently, has been the domain of the criminal underworld.  After years of lobbying by doctors, cancer patients and parents of sick children, medical cannabis has finally been legalised.  And with the ink still drying on the Federal Government’s laws, key players are ready to pounce on what is tipped to become a billion-dollar industry (once state laws catch up, and a national regulator is established). But for Australians already buying cannabis under murky legal conditions, the impact of the new legal industry remains uncertain. Canadian company Tilray is about to embark on the world’s biggest clinical trial of marijuana’s impact on chemotherapy patients in partnership with the NSW Government and the University of Sydney.  If all goes well, the company is looking to import cannabis products from its state-of-the-art facility on Vancouver Island, where it grows and extracts the product that has spawned a $250 billion global industry, and establish a plantation on Australian soil. “In Australia, we think that medical cannabis has potential to be a billion-dollar industry, and can create thousands of skilled jobs and generate tens of millions of dollars in foreign investment,” the company’s global president Brendan Kennedy told news.com.au.  “We hope to invest significant capital in Australia in coming years ... We intend to break ground on an Australian facility in the next 12 months.” Tilray’s hi-tech Canadian greenhouse has 100,000 plants and 50 different strains of cannabis, which its team of botanists and biochemists cultivate for their different medicinal properties. But for Bendigo mum Cheri O’Connell, the medicine she needs for 10-year-old Tara is closer to home — and a hell of a lot cheaper. Tara, who has a life-threatening form of epilepsy called Dravet syndrome, used to have up to 200 seizures a day and was expected to die before her ninth birthday.  “Now she’s walking, talking, running, reading — all those things that we just never thought possible,” Ms O’Connell said.  Her recovery began in 2013 when she started taking a tincture made from THCA, a non-psychoactive cannabinoid extracted through a process developed by Nimbin identity Tony Bower through years of trial and error. Ms O’Connell does not pay for the product, but believes when it is available in the retail market it would sell for between $30 and $100, depending on the bottle size and strength. She has looked at the prices of medical cannabis products available in the United States and found they cost up to $2000 a month. She fears regulation will push up the price of the product that has allowed her family a normal life — or worse.  Mr Bower, who has been distributing his products to the ill and infirm for more than a decade through his business Mullaways Medical Cannabis, argues he can make the pain-relieving tinctures more cheaply than big pharma.  “We have something in Australia that we know works,” he told news.com.au.  While Mr Bower’s products have not been chosen for a clinical trial, his customers swear by it — and, without an affordable option, “will just keep getting it illegally”, he said.  Aside from the cost, parents live with the ever-present fear of an education department crackdown.  Tara has to take her medicine several times during the school day, and this has already seen her excluded from a special needs school.  “We have the knowledge that, at any time, if the education department or anyone up the chain says ‘sorry we can’t do it at school anymore’, then she’ll be home schooled,” Ms O’Connell said.  Mr Bower, who has raised $10 million from private investors to set up five shade houses with 600 plants, said he was considering a move to Victoria, where he believes the approval process may be quicker. Cardiologist Dr Ross Walker, who recently became a director of mining-turned-cannabis company MGC Pharmaceuticals, said getting cannabis products onto the PBS could take years.  Dr Walker, who describes cannabinoids as “the next big thing in medicine”, said he hoped the process could be expedited in order to get the medicine to those who need it.  “I’ve seen three patients in the last two days who I think would be highly suitable for medical cannabis,” he said. “One girl with very serious breast cancer, and another person with severe pain where they’re just not getting any relief from the current therapy available. And another person with pain. I just think it’s dreadful that we can’t offer these things to people.” MGC, an Israeli company that relisted on the Australian Stock Exchange last week after being bought out by Erin Resources, operates a cannabis growing and extraction facility in Slovenia where it makes skin care products and cosmetics containing a non-psychoactive extract called Cannabidoil (CBD). The company plans to grow cannabis locally once the regulatory system has been set up.  Both MGC and Tilray will offer cannabis products on a compassionate use basis, through the Therapeutic Goods Administration’s special access scheme. This will allow a small number of seriously ill patients to access the drugs at a lower cost. The Federal Health Department says in a statement on its website: “The Government wants to ensure that Australians get access to the most effective medical treatments that are available, but it is important to ensure we follow the principles of evidence-based medicine.  “The Government has a duty to ensure that any therapeutic product, including medicinal cannabis, is a safe and effective treatment for public use, and also meets the manufacturing standards that the Australian public expect.” dana.mccauley@news.com.au A Melbourne building firm has slashed its headcount for the second time in six months, just a few days after another major construction company collapsed.

SUNSHINE Coast mum Katrina Spraggon is so desperate to get her daughter Kaitlyn the cannabis oil that stops the nine-year-old’s crippling seizures that she has started making the illegal drug herself.  Ms Spraggon said she had tried everything to get Queensland Health to prescribe the drug but instead she had been told Lady Cilento Hospital would no longer treat her daughter if she continued using it and police searched her house the day Kaitlyn returned from treatment.   She said Queensland Health also refused to renew her daughter’s supply of bottled oxygen — which runs out this month and she’ll die without — in the latest episode of her three-year fight with the government.  A last-minute meeting with Health Minister Cameron Dick on Friday afternoon after One Nation MP Steve Dickson raised her case in Parliament secured Kaitlyn the bottled oxygen but her mother said she could not take her daughter off the illegal drug for fear she would have more seizures, which require CPR and oxygen to keep her alive.  The Ningi single mum said her daughter relied on the THC in raw cannabis oil to ease chronic pain from spinal and hip problems. Without it, the pain triggered severe seizures. She said that Kaitlyn had been prescribed a cocktail of strong opioids and other prescription drugs to deal with her 19 medical conditions but they left her heavily sedated.  Since using cannabis her daughter had been alert and had been interacting with siblings and ready to return to school, Ms Spraggon said. She told Queensland Health doctors and the police and put details on Facebook and said it was the only way to stop her daughter’s seizures.  She said she desperately wanted a cannabis oil with THC prescription for her daughter so she could stop making the drug but had been stonewalled.  “The cannabis oil I’m using, it’s illegal,” Ms Spraggon told The Sunday Mail. “I’ve been open and honest since three years that I’ve put my daughter on it. I haven’t hidden a thing.” She said she had repeatedly tried to have a meeting with Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, who had posed with her daughter at Christmas parties but not scheduled a meeting.  A spokesman for Mr Dick said doctors could prescribe raw cannabis if they believed it would benefit patients but Ms Spraggon was told it was illegal to use cannabis in Queensland outside that framework.  “To date, there have been 20 applications from medical practitioners across Queensland to prescribe medicinal cannabis,” he said. But he said privacy laws stopped Queensland Health from naming those doctors. “Ms Spraggon was advised that under Queensland’s new legal framework an application for medicinal cannabis could be made by Kaitlyn’s paediatric specialist if the specialist considered it could provide a clinical benefit,” he said.

But Lucy Haslam’s shock move could change Australia. WHEN her son Daniel died of cancer at 25, Lucy Haslam became a drug dealer. She knew it was what Dan would have wanted, as a regular user of medical marijuana to stave off crippling nausea from his chemotherapy. Mrs Haslam and her husband Lou, a former drug squad officer, have now sold their cafe and are about to open a cannabis centre in Tamworth, NSW. While the Federal Government this weekend agreed to start drawing up plans for Australian-grown and regulated medicinal cannabis, the Haslams say many patients have no time to delay. “The first time [Dan] used cannabis was in cigarette form, because it was all we had access to,” Mrs Haslam told news.com.au, ahead of her appearance on tonight’s Australian Story on ABC at 8pm. “It worked amazingly well, just a couple of drags stopped the nausea and vomiting. Once it was clear it would be helpful, we bought a vaporiser because he’s a nonsmoker. He used that every fortnight for a few days after chemo.  “It he hadn’t had that, we would have to take him to a private hospital where he was put on a drip. He would lie in the dark, not talk, not have the TV on, just lie totally still.” Dan, who was diagnosed with terminal bowel cancer at the age of 20, would vomit even at the thought of chemo. Cannabis changed everything, so after his initial supply from another patient ran out, Mrs Haslam had to work out how to get more.  She asked a few people at her cafe. “Luckily I asked the right customers,” she said. “I became a drug supplier.” While the family discussed the plan first, Dan hated that his parents were being forced to break the law. “He was determined we shouldn’t be treated as criminals,” said his mother. “Had my husband still been active in the police force, he would have risked dismissal.” Dan and his family began campaigning to legalise medicinal cannabis. His powerful story changed the minds of several politicians, including NSW Premier Mike Baird, who announced a multi-million dollar trial that could legalise the use of medicinal cannabis and cannabis oil. “I will never forget the look in his eyes the first time I met him and it will stay with me forever,” the Premier said in a statement. “Dan made a lasting impression on everyone he met, but, more than that, he left a legacy in NSW that will be felt across the nation, and I believe the world. Every step we take on medical cannabis will be built on the footsteps he left behind.” Shortly before he died, Dan called the medicinal marijuana movement had become an “unstoppable force”, the Northern Daily Leader reported. He would have been proud to see his mother leading the country on the issue. “It feels like the stress is finally lifting off our shoulders; nothing can stop it now,” he said. When he passed away in February — survived by his parents, siblings Luke and Billy and wife Alyce — the family vowed to “honour his fighting spirit and continue his legacy”.  The Haslams have several scientists on board, have found a property in Tamworth to serve as a research and development facility and have applied for a growing exemption with the NSW government. They are eager to begin work as soon as possible, so the scientists can begin developing strains for different conditions. “It’s not like planting wheat seeds, it’s really complex,” said Mrs Haslam. “The aim is to transfer research into growing for compassionate access, so people can know there’s quality control and know what they’re taking. You only get one crop a year, unless you have it indoors under lights, so we’re keen to get it going this year. Outdoors is preferable because it keeps the costs down. We could be growing within a couple of months.” NSW Premier Baird has credited Dan’s mother with turning the debate on its head, and changing the mind of the ordinary Australians. “They’ve turned something that politicians and governments were very coy about and didn’t want to discuss into a raging national debate,” he said. Mrs Haslam’s petition to decriminalise medicinal cannabis for cancer patients is now officially the third biggest in the history of Change.org Australia, having recently climbed to 246,000 signatures. She says she’s had surprisingly little negative feedback, aside from a few, very conservative anti-drugs groups. The family feel this work keeps them connected to Dan. “I think Dan would possibly be a little bit surprised knowing that his mother is planning on setting up a cannabis centre in Tamworth, but I mean this whole journey has been full of surprises,” said his widow, Alyce. While it seems strange this pioneering role in legalising cannabis has fallen to a cafe-owning mother from Tamworth, Mrs Haslam doesn’t see it as a choice any more. “Dan cared a lot about people,” she said. “He was my priority, I was doing it for him, but it soon became evident a lot of people could benefit, including children with intractable epilepsy. “After I lost Dan, I felt compelled to finish this for him. He would have wanted me to see it through. If I don’t do it, no one else will.” Australian Story: Doing it for Dan airs tonight at 8pm on ABC. Tweet #AustralianStory and @newscomauHQ.

Now she’s desperate to take make one legal. The niece of Olivia Newton-John has come out strongly in support of the Australian icon as she fights to make medicinal cannabis more available for every day Australians. Tottie Goldsmith, 56, says it has been remarkable to see the positive effect of medicinal cannabis on her aunt as she fights stage four-breast cancer. It is the third time she has battled the cancer. “I was with her in Melbourne last year when she was in hospital going through her treatment undercover, I was in there every second day and we even had her birthday in there,” Goldsmith told news.com.au. “We were sneaking around and she was at her worst. To see her now, I haven’t physically seen her in Los Angeles but on FaceTime and on 60 Minutes, to see her getting better is a relief. “It’s amazing.”   RELATED: ONJ reveals why she is not scared of death  RELATED: ONJ opens up on her health battle  RELATED: Dicko reveals what it’s like being an Australian Idol judge Newton-John, 70, is lobbying the Australian Government to make it easy to have access to medicinal cannabis, something she has been doing to fight the cancer with the help of her husband John Easterling at her ranch in Los Angeles. Goldsmith said it is inspiring to see Newton-John speaking out so publicly about the issue of medicinal cannabis and is encouraging the whole nation to get behind her. “Just seeing her speak the truth about what has helped is so poignant, powerful and important,” Goldsmith said. “My thoughts are that it’s insane it’s not easily available in Australia for patients. “I’ve spent a lot of time speaking to John Easterling about it, about all the different strains and the different specific things about it. “I go in to the hospital (the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness & Research Centre) with Liv to see patients and they have anxiety, they are in pain, they have trouble sleeping. “If we can’t help them with a natural herb, to me that is cruel. “I think the most important thing is to demystify it and for people to understand, it’s not about getting stoned, it’s about getting comfortable. “I’m just so proud of her.” Goldsmith backed up Easterling, who on 60 Minutes said his wife was never part of the drug culture in the music business.  For Newton-John, medicinal cannabis is all about getting healthy again. “She has never done a drug in her life,” Goldsmith said. “This is not about drugs, it’s about medicine.” There are signs medicinal cannabis is getting easier to access for patients in Australia, perhaps partly due to Newton-John’s recent campaigning.  The Therapeutic Goods Administration has approved more and more patients’ usage of medicinal cannabis. In a report in Melbourne’s Herald Sun last week Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt announced companies would be able to apply for “major project status” to make it easier to actually harvest medicinal cannabis. At the moment there are 69 licences to grow medicinal cannabis in Australia. It’s tipped eventually it could be billion dollar industry in Australia in coming years. In Victoria, Reason Party MP Fiona Patten is hoping to go one step further. She hopes to legalise cannabis recreationally, which has already happened across some States in the United States, including Newton-John’s home State of California.  Newton John’s hospital in Melbourne is also conducting trials into medicinal cannabis. “I saw Olivia before and after her pelvis was fractured, she was in so much pain, it was so hard to watch,” she said. “To think that a natural herb that our earth produces can help you through that pain and anxiety, then why not?  “I don’t get it. My stomach gets tight when I think about it.”  Newton-John fractured her pelvis while in Melbourne last September.  It was then that she celebrated her 70th birthday in hospital, the hospital she built from scratch. She continues to use medical cannabis every day as she strives to get better and manage her pain. She had planned to have a huge birthday party in Los Angeles, but that was put on hold. Before she fractured her pelvis she had months of excruciating pain, “sleep depriving, crying out loud pain,” and with the help of medicinal cannabis, that pain was managed. “I was on morphine because the pain was that intense,” Newton-John told 60 Minutes. “I was terrified of starting it, because I know it’s a very hard thing to ween off. “But I’m now off it, and I weened myself off it with cannabis.” She told 60 Minutes that she isn’t prescribed a certain amount of cannabis everyday, taking it in drops of oil every night. She has learnt what is right for her “You learn by the feel, it’s like anything … I’m very pro cannabis.”  Goldsmith is not surprised how hard Newton-John is fighting, despite having stage four breast cancer. “She is amazing,” she said. “I think so much of it is the power of thought as well. She really understands the chemicals that are released if we feel fear, and she has a very strong mind and I think that is helping her heal. She is just a beacon, she really is.”  Her whole life, Goldsmith said Newton-John had always put others ahead of herself. “She has always been a massive empath,” she said. “From her big shows and the meet and greets with fans backstage, it was always inquiring about other people. She’s never been comfortable talking about herself.” Goldsmith said walking through the hospital in Melbourne it is remarkable to see the impact Newton-John has on patients. “They get stunned to begin with, then they are in awe of her because she has got this light,” she said. “Take away her celebrity, she has a warmth and a love that she exudes, because she has been through their journey.” The first stage of the Olivia Newton John Cancer Wellness & Research Centre opened in Melbourne in 2015, after the Australian icon spent years raising millions for the project. Last year, at a surprise function in Melbourne, Newton-John made her niece a goodwill ambassador of the hospital she built from scratch.  “No one told me, it was such an incredible moment,” Goldsmith said. Newton-John will auction off those iconic pants she wore as Sandy in Grease later in the year and she hopes to raise at least $1 million for charity. Goldsmith believes she will get there. “She will get a million bucks, but I’m not sure who could ever fit in them,” she joked.   The annual Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness & Research Centre will take place again this year in Melbourne on October 6.

Millions of Australians are quietly suffering through chronic pain, and the treatment options remain terribly flawed. The advocacy group Painaustralia, which works to improve quality of life for people living with pain, commissioned Deloitte Access Economics to quantify the impact of chronic pain in Australia. Deloitte released its report today. The findings are staggering. In 2018, 3.2 million Australians lived with chronic pain. More than two-thirds of them were of working age. Between 30 and 40 per cent of people dealing with pain also have depression or anxiety. About 40 per cent are forced into early retirement because of their condition. The problem drains $140 billion from our economy each year through costs to health, productivity and wellbeing. And Australia’s poor management of chronic pain is leading to increased opioid misuse, with deadly consequences. The Government responded to Deloitte’s report with a $6.8 million announcement, designed to “improve understanding and management” of pain by both patients and doctors. The new policy includes $500,000 for a public education campaign focused on the use of opioids. “Hopefully we will see less people relying on opioids and more people accessing best practice multidisciplinary care,” Painaustralia CEO Carol Bennett said in response. The extra money is desperately needed. Chronic pain is defined as pain that lasts longer than six months. Patients commonly manage it using opioids — drugs which are effective for pain relief, but carry the risk of addiction. A disturbing number of people overdose on them. According to the report, 823 Australians died due to misuse of prescription opioids in 2017-18. The death rate was highest among people between the age of 35 and 44. And far more people die from prescription opioids than illicit ones, such as heroin and cocaine. Opioids are far from the only option for combating chronic pain. Physiotherapists oversee exercise treatment, for example. Physicians prescribe anti-inflammatory drugs. Psychologists offer cognitive behavioural treatment. But one alternative does not get nearly as much attention in Australia as it does elsewhere in the world — medicinal cannabis. It is possible to obtain medicinal cannabis here, but not easy. According to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), which administers access to it, fewer than 4000 Australians have been approved for prescriptions. At the moment, GPs can apply for approval for a script with the TGA. That is done on a case-by-case basis through a program called the Special Access Scheme. Doctors can also become authorised prescribers of medicinal cannabis, but as of January 31 this year, just 54 had done so. Why is the treatment so rarely prescribed? Four thousand patients is a tiny figure, given more than three million of us suffer from chronic pain. One reason is the difficulty of the process. The other is that it’s unclear how effective medicinal cannabis is. As the Australian Medical Association has repeatedly said, the jury is still very much out. But there are reasons to be optimistic. News.com.au spoke to Dr Mark Ware, a global expert on cannabis who has been helping patients manage chronic pain for decades and advising the Canadian government on the issue since the turn of the century. Dr Ware is the Chief Medical Officer at Canopy Growth. “Regular pain is useful. It tells you not to be an idiot, not to do that again,” Dr Ware said. “Pain that goes on so long, though, has no real value, and actually becomes very damaging to people. It has devastating and debilitating effects on people’s quality of life.” Dr Ware started doing exploratory research into the effects of cannabis almost 20 years ago after feedback from his own patients. “In the course of meeting people with chronic pain and asking them about it, it became clear to me that there were some patients who claimed using cannabis was helping them manage the pain,” he said. “There was a very robust body of scientific evidence that suggested the active ingredient in cannabis bound to special receptors in the human brain that were part of the pain pathway. “It struck me that maybe there was something to this.” Dr Ware said there was an “intriguing possibility” that cannabis use could help wean opioid addicts off the drug, or stop people from becoming addicted in the first place. There has been fairly extensive research on the idea, but we are still lacking information from formal clinical trials. “There’s a big body of basic science literature that suggests and opioid-cannabinoid synergy. Using small doses of both together gives you a similar effect to using higher doses of either,” he said. “Patients that have access to cannabis appear to have the ability to reduce their opioid dose. “Regions of the world where cannabis is available within a medical framework appear to have lower levels of opioid-related harm.” He acknowledged that medicinal cannabis does come with its own dangers and drawbacks. “Absolutely, there are many reasons to be concerned about cannabis use as a medicine, in part because most of the research that has been done in terms of the effect on humans is focused almost exclusively on the harm,” Dr Ware said. “The direction of research has generally been on young people, on driving, on mental health and so on. “But putting it into some kind of comparative risk, comparing the risks to alcohol for instance or other prescription drugs, when you put these risks into context the overall risk of cannabis appears to be quite low. “This has given us fuel to think well, maybe you could be looking more at the potential benefits.” Dr Ware said the biggest challenge was dealing with people’s preconceived notions about cannabis — both for and against it. “A lot of people think it’s either a harmless wonder drug or it’s a dangerous, evil scourge on society,” he said. The truth is somewhere in between. A search is currently underway in a state’s high country, where an Irish hiker has reportedly been missing for days.

But for any Aussies looking to take advantage of the new laws, they need to know this catch. CALIFORNIA’S progression to legalising marijuana hasn’t been all peace-out and chill. First, many of the new commercial operations set up to grow and supply legal marijuana were burnt out in wildfires late last year. Then on January 1, when adult recreational use became legal, few places had completed the necessary paperwork or seen their licences to legally sell cannabis emerge from the bureaucratic rubberstamping process. Medical pot stores, which have been legal in California for more than two decades, must receive new state permits to continue operating and many haven’t arrived yet. And now, there’s a cautionary tale for Australians in California — even though dope consumption is now legal in the state, non-citizens could still land themselves in hot water for indulging. It could have serious consequences should you ever wish to live there full-time. Anyone who isn’t a United States citizen would be careful before they partake, warns an article in the San Diego Union Tribune. Lurking in the background is the fact that while marijuana for recreational use may be legal in California and other states, it remains illegal under US federal law. Until now, President Donald Trump’s administration had made no massive moves to interfere or prosecute in any state where pot was sold legally to adults. But earlier this week, US Attorney-General Jeff Sessions rescinded an Obama administration memo that recommended a hands-off approach to marijuana prosecution in states that have legalised it’s use, indicating a possible crackdown on the federal law. So, while medicinal marijuana store owners in LA take out billboards near Los Angeles International Airport advertising their wares and word of mouth is backed up with promotions in bars and streets, visiting Aussies should know that smoking weed could still land them in trouble. “It doesn’t take a conviction for using it to affect a non-citizen’s future. If a port official finds out that someone entering the US with a visa has used the drug, the official can ban the person from the country for life,” the Tribune reported. If a green card holder is selected for a search after travelling outside the US, and officials find a receipt from a dispensary, mobile phone or social media photos at a pot shop, or any other evidence which indicates the immigrant has had marijuana, the person could be kicked out of the US. “One of the grounds for inadmissibility is whether you are a drug abuser or drug addict,” immigration lawyer Andrew Nietor told the paper. “The big problem right now is that there is so much confusion that someone could engage in an activity that involves them getting a license from the state, and the Federal Government could say that activity is unlawful and result in permanent exile from the US. “That is interpreted fairly conservatively. Any admission of prior drug use will often lead to a presumption that the person has a controlled substance problem.” Another immigration lawyer, Allan Lolly, said he had seen clients apply for visas, especially from the UK or Jamaica, and have them refused over marijuana use. More than 1300 immigrants were refused visas because of drug use in the 2016 financial year, according Department of State figures.  And more than 3000 people were unable to get temporary visas for the same reasons.  Non-citizens were also warned not to get caught with marijuana at national parks or on other federal land, because people can be charged under federal law there, with the possibility of deportation.  GREEN RUSH Marijuana has been one of California’s main cash crops — albeit largely on the black market — for years. Now, with the new law building on one which allowed people to consume marijuana for medicinal use, that black market worth about $13.5 billion could be worth $5.1 billion — legally — in 2018, USA Today reports. Five other American states offer legal marijuana sales, but the entry of California into the market is tipped to reshape the marijuana industry worldwide, with the thinking that as well as netting hundreds of millions in tax dollars, the move will also see many dealers go “straight”. Maine, Nevada, Massachusetts and California all voted to make recreational marijuana use legal for adults in 2016. It is also legal in Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Alaska and Washington DC.  The new Californian laws mean adults aged 21 and over are allowed to possess up to one ounce (about 28 grams) of marijuana at a time, and cultivate up to six plants — as long as they are out of public view. Speaking of public view, locals also urge visitors to be discreet. While it’s not unusual to see and smell weed in public, it’s not legal to smoke it in public or in a car, it’s not legal to carry it on a plane and if you’re carrying it in a car, it has to be sealed.

MEDICINAL marijuana company Phytotech Medical made a high-flying debut on the stock market yesterday, with its shares more than doubling in value. Investors who bought Phytotech shares for 20 cents each just before Christmas saw their investment skyrocket to 42 cents during their first day of trading on Thursday. Phytotech’s founder Ross Smith and managing director Boaz Wachtel, both of whom are major shareholders in the company, scooped more than $300,000 in paper profits. The Perth-based company’s stock market listing comes as it looks to break into the multi-billion dollar US market, where medicinal marijuana is legal in several states. Phytotech is also targeting Canada, Israel and Europe and hopes medicinal cannabis treatment will become available in Australia as political pressure mounts to conduct trials of the illegal drug. “The dominoes are falling globally,” Phytotech founder and executive director Ross Smith told AAP from his company’s offices in Israel. “Australia could potentially be a world centre for growing cannabis in much the same way we’re a world leader for growing medical opium.” Advocates of medicinal cannabis say the drug should be available legally in pill form to treat terminally ill patients, children with epilepsy, and cancer patients suffering from chemotherapy-related nausea. Phytotech plans to work with farmers in the US and Uruguay to grow indoor and outdoor marijuana crops for medicinal purposes. It estimates the global cannabis industry is worth up to $US100 billion. In Australia, the NSW government is spending $9 million on three trials for medicinal cannabis, but Mr Smith believes Victoria is most likely to legalise the drug once federal laws governing distribution and production are passed. Mr Smith acknowledged the majority of Australia is governed by conservative governments, but said lawmakers could not ignore the legalisation of medicinal cannabis in 23 US states and seven European countries. “This is happening,” Mr Smith said. “What a pity that once it becomes legal in Victoria and NSW that people in other states will have to move interstate to treat their child with seizures.” Prime Minister Tony Abbott supports state-based trials of the drug, but has dodged suggestions of a national experiment. A private members bill seeking the formation of a regulator to oversee the production and distribution of medical cannabis is expected to be debated in the Senate as early as next month. Demand for Phytotech shares was strong after it released documents regarding its stock market float last December. It originally planned to raise $5 million through the issue of shares to investors, but strong demand forced it to issue another $900,000 worth of stock. Options Xpress market analyst Ben Le Brun said Phytotech had made a spectacular share market debut, with just under 13 million shares changing hands. “It’s got high prospects for growth overall,” he said. “The research suggests that the relief the drug gives people suffering all manner of conditions can’t really be doubted.” A father-of-two has revealed how he grew his property worth by $4.9 million, five years after arriving in Australia with just $7000 to his name.

ALMOST 90 per cent of South Australians believe marijuana should be made available for medicinal purposes, a survey has found. As the Federal Government prepares to allow commercial medicinal cannabis crops, a Roy Morgan study has found overwhelming public support for cannabis-based medicines to be legally prescribed to patients with serious illnesses.  But there appears to be little public appetite for the Federal Government to copy the example of incoming Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, who wants to legalise the recreational use of marijuana in his country. The survey found that 89 per cent of South Australian residents and 91 per cent of Australians believed the medicinal use of marijuana should be legal. Roy Morgan Research chief executive Michelle Levine said 92 per cent of Liberal and Nationals voters, 94 per cent of Labor voters and 97 per cent of Greens supporters believed medical marijuana should be legal. “Unlike some social issues, legalising medicinal marijuana is widely favoured by electors of different political persuasions and age groups, which really tells us its time has come,’’ Ms Levine said. “Not surprisingly, Australians aged 50-plus are the strongest supporters, as this group is most susceptible to several of the conditions that medicinal marijuana can provide relief from.’’ The NSW Government is preparing to run a series of medical marijuana clinical trials for patients with serious illnesses. The Victorian, Queensland and ACT Governments also want patients in their states to be able to participate in clinical trials and New Zealand Government ministers have also expressed interest in the research. The SA Government intends to monitor the progress of the trials but will not participate at this stage. Australian Medical Association SA President Janice Fletcher yesterday said there was evidence to suggest pharmaceutical cannabis had medicinal value for a small number of people in specific circumstances. There had been encouraging evidence about the effectiveness of the drug in controlling spasticity in patients with Multiple Sclerosis and nausea and vomiting in cancer patients. “The AMA supports that therapeutic cannabinoids that are scientifically evaluated to be safe and effective be made available to patients for whom existing medications are not as effective,’’ Dr Fletcher said. The Federal Government will introduce a bill into Parliament next month to enable the licencing of medicinal cannabis crops. Federal Labor wants patients with serious illnesses to be given access to medicinal cannabis prescribed by doctors. Ms Levine said only about 30 per cent of Australians believed the recreational smoking of marijuana should be legal. “This demonstrates that Australians understand that smoking and consuming marijuana for medicinal purposes are two very separate issues,’’ she said. The Roy Morgan survey of 644 Australians aged 14 years and over was conducted last week. The new Canadian centre-left Liberal Government plans to legalise cannabis.

Here is why he needs a refresh. OPINION:   IT FEELS like every time a new drug law reform policy to decriminalise weed for adults in Australia is suggested, people lose their minds and immediately begin fear mongering about why letting people smoke marijuana legally will lead to anarchy in the streets.  It’s actually quite easy to see why this opinion is held given the disorder and mayhem seen in America after Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington DC legalised recreational cannabis on January 1 this year.  Actually come to think of it, these US states have only seen a decrease in weed-related arrests, a stimulated economy from taxing marijuana and medicinal benefits for users.  If this is the case, why does Australia feel the need to peddle outdated anti-weed propaganda with pitchforks in hand?  My guess is a lack of education about the drug and an unwillingness to have an open mind when discussing whether it’s time to let adults — who already smoke weed anyway — to purchase it legally so they can stop dealing with criminals.  One only has to look at David Koch’s interview with Green’s leader Richard Di Natale on Sunrise earlier this week to see how embarrassingly stuck in the dark ages some Aussies are when it comes to the debate of legalisation.  The awkward interview, which Kochie appeared to research by watching the 1936 propaganda film Reefer Madness that explores the melodramatic events that ensue when high school students try marijuana, was nothing short of cringe-worthy and an embarrassment to those wanting to be heard in an educated and modern discussion.  “Most Australians would be going, look, you’ve been smoking marijuana,” Kochie said in response to Di Natale’s proposal.  Di Natale’s basis for legalisation was it would raise hundreds of millions of dollars in tax, would remove the power from the crime syndicates and would prevent innocent Aussies just wanting a smoke from obtaining damaging criminal records.  “We have got to get real about cannabis, nearly seven million Australians use it,” he said.  “The reality is that’s a choice that feeds big criminal syndicates, they are the ones that benefit from the current system. “This is taking it out of the hands of criminals and putting it within a tightly controlled health framework.” Kochie took offence to common sense and immediately reverted back to outdated “facts” about marijuana and even admitted that while Di Natale’s professional experience in the field as a drug and alcohol doctor made gave him more knowledgeable, he still wasn’t convinced.  To help break down the flaws in Kochie’s argument or to help sway those who are actually willing to have a discussion about the legalisation of weed, here’s some modern research.   ALCOHOL IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN WEED  Yes, Kochie was shocked when the Greens leader said weed was safer than booze. As Di Natale pointed out, people die from acute alcohol toxicity all the time, yet there have been zero recorded cases of overdosing on marijuana.  OK, sure you can’t die, but what about the other health risks that have been linked to weed over time?  In an attempt to sort fact from fiction, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine completed the world’s most comprehensive study into marijuana last year.  After examining more than 10,000 scientific abstracts dating back to 1999, the extensive 395-page report unearthed more than 100 conclusions about the health effects of recreational and therapeutic cannabis use — many of which support arguments it should be legal. “The evidence suggests that smoking cannabis does not increase the risk for certain cancers (ie. lung, head, and neck) in adults,” one of the findings read. And while it did admit smoking cannabis on a regular basis is associated with chronic cough and phlegm production, it explained taking the drug orally will likely reduce these symptoms — legalisation of weed means you can buy eatables and not be forced to smoke. The report also confirmed the many therapeutic effects of weed. “In adults with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, oral cannabinoids are effective antiemetics,” the report read. “In adults with chronic pain, patients who were treated with cannabis or cannabinoids are more likely to experience a clinically significant reduction in pain symptoms. “In adults with multiple sclerosis (MS)-related spasticity, short-term use of oral cannabinoids improves patient reported spasticity symptoms.” When looking at cannabis use and mental health, the findings offer mixed results. “Cannabis use is likely to increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychoses; the higher the use the greater the risk,” the report read. However, it added that a history of cannabis use in individuals with schizophrenia and other psychoses may be “linked to better performance on learning and memory tasks”. The research found smoking weed did not appear to increase the likelihood of developing depression, anxiety or PTSD, and heavy cannabis smokers more likely to talk about their thoughts of suicide than non-users.  WON’T SOMEBODY THINK OF THE CHILDREN  One of the most common arguments with the legalisation of weed is that more children will have access to the drug at a young age.  These people seem to forget that it will be treated with the same age restrictions used for the sale of alcohol — plus there’s nothing stopping a 15-year-old who wants to smoke pot from buying it off the street already.  But let’s forget the age restrictions for a minute and take a look at places that have legalised marijuana and how this has impacted underage use.  As it turns out, fewer teenagers are using cannabis in Colorado since the state’s tightly regulated legal market launched at the start of 2014.  According to the annual National Survey on Drug Use and Health, marijuana use by kids between 12 and 17 had dropped 11 per cent from year prior and 12.5 per cent from the previous two years in Colorado.  This drop is attributed to the amount of money that Colorado has poured into awareness and education programs, plus making it harder to obtain by removing it from the black market.   IT CAN’T BE WORTH THAT MUCH TO THE ECONOMY According to marijuana industry analyst Tom Adams, the industry in the US took in nearly $AU11.7 billion in sales in 2017 — equivalent to the entire snack bar industry. But with weed now legal in a number of US states, Adams estimates that national marijuana sales will rise to $AU14.3 billion in 2018, and to $AU27.4 billion in 2021. State senator from Nevada Tick Segerblom has also praised the legalisation of weed, with the state reaping more than $A36 million in tax revenue since recreational sales started.  “It’s a great thing because the money was already being spent [when it was illegal] it’s just now being taxed,” he told CNN. “And cops don’t have to waste their time arresting users.” Earlier research conducted by the Institute of Cannabis Research at Colorado State University found the legalisation of weed raked in $AU74 million in tax in 2016, with $AU29 million of that put toward marijuana-related programs to educate users.   DOES WEED MAKE YOU LAZY? Recent times have shown a huge surge in people smoking weed to help athletic performance as it deepens concentration, increases tissue oxygenation, and decreases muscle spasms before, during and after exercise. Ultra-endurance athlete Avery Collins, who runs 240km per week, said training stoned helps him achieve flow quicker as the “runner’s high” acts upon the same receptors that receive the THC in marijuana. “I use it as a way to intensify and enhance the run. It makes the longevity of the runner’s high last longer because technically you’re already high,” he told Motherboard. Cannabis has long been accredited with anti-inflammatory properties and Mr Collins said he also smokes weed for the pain relief after gruelling training sessions. “I’d be lying if I said [cannabis] doesn’t help soothe my muscles,” he added. It’s not just runners who benefit either, with UFC commentator/stand-up comedian/podcaster Joe Rogan talking about its benefits for fighters. “I think it (marijuana) is a performance-enhancing drug. If it wasn’t, a huge majority of jiu-jitsu guys wouldn’t be using it before they train,” he said on The MMA Hour. “They don’t do it because it hurts them; they do it because it helps them.” He also claimed to have seen the benefits first-hand. “I like to smoke pot and work out,” he said. “Getting high and working out is one of the least talked about and least appreciated pleasures of fitness.”  HOW AUSTRALIA CURRENTLY SITS WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD  Our country is slowly taking steps to change its stance on weed, with Victoria becoming the first state to legalise marijuana for young children suffering from epilepsy, while NSW also allows use for patients suffering from serious illnesses such as cancer or multiple sclerosis. Queensland’s laws are the most flexible in the country, which grant patients of any age or suffering from a range of illnesses access to medicinal cannabis products. Tasmania allows medical cannabis in limited circumstances where conventional treatment has been unsuccessful, as does Western Australia, South Australia, the NT and the ACT. While the use of medical marijuana is a step in the right direction, we also need to be talking about legalising it for recreational use, which would bring us on par with a number of countries across the world. In addition to the earlier mentioned US States, Austria, Bangladesh, Belgium, Belize, Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Greece, parts of India, Italy, Jamaica, Luzembourg, Malta, Mexico, Myanmar, Netherlands, Norway, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Russia, Solvenia, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine and Uruguay all have made recreational weed use legal or have decriminalised it — and the world hasn’t ended yet.  So maybe Kochie just needs to understand that letting adults enjoy a cheeky toke or two is not going to lead to the end of the world.

The health system prefers he’s addicted to morphine. PAUL Hilder considers himself to be a pretty normal guy. He is a former schoolteacher who has since turned his attention to music and studio work. He has children he adores and he wants to live a healthy and happy life. But he believes Australia’s outdated doctrines don’t allow this — they want him to be hooked on legal heroin instead. It all stems back to a car accident in 2009 which saw his lower leg and heel bone crushed. “I was driving with my family from Mackay to Emerald when an elderly gentleman turned across my path on a highway. I swerved to miss him, my car got airborne and I was sent into a tree,” he told news.com.au. “Thankfully my kids were fine, but I was left severely injured when the front wheel was forced through the bottom of the car where the break was, smashing my heel into 10 pieces and changing my life forever.” The Queensland-based musician underwent multiple surgeries to try and fix the pain, but nothing worked. However, having used recreational cannabis throughout his life, Mr Hilder turned to smoking and found the pain relief he was searching for. “I found THC effective in elevating my mood as it helped take my mind away from the pain. Further to the relaxation there was the massive anti-inflammatory properties I experienced,” he said. “It might only sound minor, but marijuana helps me walk more freely around my house, which is a huge win for quality of life.” Mr Hilder said after noticing the benefits cannabis offered him, he attempted to get a legal prescription for medicinal marijuana to ensure he was not breaking the law. After months of trying, he found himself no closer to being given access to medical cannabis, with the medicine appearing to be reserved only for those that were terminally ill. And even though he told his doctors that weed had helped with pain relief, Mr Hilder found himself offered methadone, OxyContin and other opiates instead. “OxyContin is the medicine I take morning and night but it has awful side effects,” he said. “I can tell you first-hand that the drug is terribly addictive and gives you withdrawals just 12 hours after using it. It changes my mood and causes me to be aggressive when I am normally lucid.” Unable to get medicinal marijuana and wanting to avoid putting himself in a situation where he had to buy from the black market, Mr Hilder decided to grow his own for pain relief. Even though he wasn’t growing to sell, he was caught in possession of a single cannabis plant and seeds. As a result he says his career and reputation are in tatters, even though he believes it was the system that let him down and forced him to grow his own cannabis. Mr Hilder said his struggles have demonstrated a real lack of knowledge about the positive effects of cannabis from within the medical community, which is why he believes it should be made recreationally legal and easier for all adults to obtain. “I am not saying we feed hash cookies to kids, but adults should be allowed to responsibly purchase marijuana for relaxation or pain relief,” he said. “We need to stop the reefer madness and make it legal like alcohol, which I believe is a far more damaging drug.” Health minister Greg Hunt admitted doctors are reluctant to prescribe cannabis, but said there are no real government barriers at all to accessing medicinal cannabis. “It is up to individual doctors — governments shouldn’t interfere in the prescribing practices of individual doctors,” he said in a statement. “We are working with the Australian Medical Association and the College of GPs to ensure that doctors have the full information, so they can ensure whether this is or isn’t in the best interest of their patients,” he said. The comments come as Australia’s budding medicinal cannabis sector has been given approval to begin exports. Mr Hunt believes allowing medicinal cannabis product exports will help the developing domestic market to grow. “By helping the domestic manufacturers to expand, this, in turn, helps to ensure an ongoing supply of medicinal cannabis products here in Australia,” he said in a statement. Such a move would bring us close to a number of US states — including Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington DC — which all made weed recreationally legal on January first this year. This brought it in line with Austria, Bangladesh, Belgium, Belize, Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Greece, parts of India, Italy, Jamaica, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Myanmar, Netherlands, Norway, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine and Uruguay — all of which have made recreational weed use legal or decriminalised. Looking at these countries makes Mr Hilder disappointed in Australia and he admits the only reasons he hasn’t picked up and moved to one of these countries is because he wants to be near his children. “My kids are my first priority, but the irony is I can’t care for them without the proper pain relief,” he said. While Mr Hilder’s motives are about seeking pain relief, he believes cannabis should be made easily available for all to use responsibly. “The human rights of people in our community need to allow them access to humanity’s oldest and safest medicine,” he said.  Earlier this year, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine completed the world’s most comprehensive study into marijuana which examined more than 10,000 scientific abstracts dating back to 1999. The extensive 395-page report unearthed more than 100 conclusions about the health effects of recreational and therapeutic cannabis use, including evidence supporting the therapeutic effects of weed. “In adults with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, oral cannabinoids are effective antiemetics,” the report read. “In adults with chronic pain, patients who were treated with cannabis or cannabinoids are more likely to experience a clinically significant reduction in pain symptoms. “In adults with multiple sclerosis (MS)-related spasticity, short-term use of oral cannabinoids improves patient reported spasticity symptoms.” When looking at the effects of cannabis or cannabinoid-based therapeutics on the human immune system, the researchers said there is insufficient data to draw overarching conclusions. However, the report claims there is “limited evidence to suggest that regular exposure to cannabis smoke may have anti-inflammatory activity.” Despite overwhelming evidence to suggest otherwise, there are still many websites countering the argument for legalisation. “Psychoactive substances that affect the mind, whether it is MDMA, cocaine, heroin, marijuana, alcohol — the list goes on and on — are not a solution to man’s ills or his personal failings or problems,” one website reads. “Using drugs to ‘solve’ a problem in interpersonal relationships begets new problems associated with drug use. Drug-induced thoughts and emotions are just that — drug-induced. A person’s real thoughts and true emotions do not stem from a chemical substance. “A healthy body and a well-functioning mind undamaged by psychoactive chemical substances are requisite to living life fully, finding self-satisfaction, and experiencing rewarding interpersonal relationships. In truth, there is no chemical substitute for living life.” Mr Hilder is currently working with the #StandUpforCannabis campaign and is working to hold a national day of action on May 5, 2018.

But Lucy Haslam’s shock move could change Australia. WHEN her son Daniel died of cancer at 25, Lucy Haslam became a drug dealer. She knew it was what Dan would have wanted, as a regular user of medical marijuana to stave off crippling nausea from his chemotherapy. Mrs Haslam and her husband Lou, a former drug squad officer, have now sold their cafe and are about to open a cannabis centre in Tamworth, NSW. While the Federal Government this weekend agreed to start drawing up plans for Australian-grown and regulated medicinal cannabis, the Haslams say many patients have no time to delay. “The first time [Dan] used cannabis was in cigarette form, because it was all we had access to,” Mrs Haslam told news.com.au, ahead of her appearance on tonight’s Australian Story on ABC at 8pm. “It worked amazingly well, just a couple of drags stopped the nausea and vomiting. Once it was clear it would be helpful, we bought a vaporiser because he’s a nonsmoker. He used that every fortnight for a few days after chemo.  “It he hadn’t had that, we would have to take him to a private hospital where he was put on a drip. He would lie in the dark, not talk, not have the TV on, just lie totally still.” Dan, who was diagnosed with terminal bowel cancer at the age of 20, would vomit even at the thought of chemo. Cannabis changed everything, so after his initial supply from another patient ran out, Mrs Haslam had to work out how to get more.  She asked a few people at her cafe. “Luckily I asked the right customers,” she said. “I became a drug supplier.” While the family discussed the plan first, Dan hated that his parents were being forced to break the law. “He was determined we shouldn’t be treated as criminals,” said his mother. “Had my husband still been active in the police force, he would have risked dismissal.” Dan and his family began campaigning to legalise medicinal cannabis. His powerful story changed the minds of several politicians, including NSW Premier Mike Baird, who announced a multi-million dollar trial that could legalise the use of medicinal cannabis and cannabis oil. “I will never forget the look in his eyes the first time I met him and it will stay with me forever,” the Premier said in a statement. “Dan made a lasting impression on everyone he met, but, more than that, he left a legacy in NSW that will be felt across the nation, and I believe the world. Every step we take on medical cannabis will be built on the footsteps he left behind.” Shortly before he died, Dan called the medicinal marijuana movement had become an “unstoppable force”, the Northern Daily Leader reported. He would have been proud to see his mother leading the country on the issue. “It feels like the stress is finally lifting off our shoulders; nothing can stop it now,” he said. When he passed away in February — survived by his parents, siblings Luke and Billy and wife Alyce — the family vowed to “honour his fighting spirit and continue his legacy”.  The Haslams have several scientists on board, have found a property in Tamworth to serve as a research and development facility and have applied for a growing exemption with the NSW government. They are eager to begin work as soon as possible, so the scientists can begin developing strains for different conditions. “It’s not like planting wheat seeds, it’s really complex,” said Mrs Haslam. “The aim is to transfer research into growing for compassionate access, so people can know there’s quality control and know what they’re taking. You only get one crop a year, unless you have it indoors under lights, so we’re keen to get it going this year. Outdoors is preferable because it keeps the costs down. We could be growing within a couple of months.” NSW Premier Baird has credited Dan’s mother with turning the debate on its head, and changing the mind of the ordinary Australians. “They’ve turned something that politicians and governments were very coy about and didn’t want to discuss into a raging national debate,” he said. Mrs Haslam’s petition to decriminalise medicinal cannabis for cancer patients is now officially the third biggest in the history of Change.org Australia, having recently climbed to 246,000 signatures. She says she’s had surprisingly little negative feedback, aside from a few, very conservative anti-drugs groups. The family feel this work keeps them connected to Dan. “I think Dan would possibly be a little bit surprised knowing that his mother is planning on setting up a cannabis centre in Tamworth, but I mean this whole journey has been full of surprises,” said his widow, Alyce. While it seems strange this pioneering role in legalising cannabis has fallen to a cafe-owning mother from Tamworth, Mrs Haslam doesn’t see it as a choice any more. “Dan cared a lot about people,” she said. “He was my priority, I was doing it for him, but it soon became evident a lot of people could benefit, including children with intractable epilepsy. “After I lost Dan, I felt compelled to finish this for him. He would have wanted me to see it through. If I don’t do it, no one else will.” Australian Story: Doing it for Dan airs tonight at 8pm on ABC. Tweet #AustralianStory and @newscomauHQ.

QUIETLY defiant pensioner Ian Oates holds up a large bag of medicines on the lawns of Parliament House.  They are the pills that Inga, his wife of 53 years, no longer needs since she discovered the healing power of medicinal cannabis. On an action-packed final day of the parliamentary inquiry into medicinal cannabis, Mr Oates, 73, told a hushed Legislative Council committee that Inga no longer needed to take multiple medicines because of the “miraculous” effects of medicinal cannabis. Mrs Oates has suffered with severe osteoporosis for the past 40 years. During that time she has experienced intractable pain, vomiting, sleeplessness and been bedridden for up to 23 hours a day. The Oates had never written to a politician before making the submission to the inquiry and their powerful testimony left politicians speechless.  A friend who has prostate cancer visited the couple a year ago and a week later a small bottle of cannabis tincture arrived in the mail. The couple left the bottle in the fridge for a week before Mrs Oates said she plucked up the courage to take it. That night she slept like a baby and hasn't looked back, she said. “It’s an absolute miracle,” Mrs Oates said.  A small bottle arrives in the mail every six weeks from the family friend, who sources the product from a producer in Nimbin who supplies hundreds of people around Australia at no charge. “Her [Mrs Oates’] quality of life is the best it’s been in 40 years,” Mr Oates said. Her local GP fully supports Mrs Oates’ use of medicinal cannabis.  She takes two drops under her tongue two or three times a day and 1 ½ or 2ml of oil under her tongue at night. Mrs Oates wears a full body brace 24 hours a day and her husband washes and clothes her but she has still sustained 99 fractures over the years because of osteoporosis. Mr Oates said his wife’s skin has gone from the texture “of my old boot leather to soft and her hair has gone from rusty barbed wire to now soft and silky” with the use of cannabis. MLC Ruth Forest asked Mrs Oates if she had a “high” feeling or any hallucinations from the cannabis product. “I don’t have any effects whatsoever,” Mrs Oates said. “Normally, I’m vomiting all day long. It just gives me a really good night’s sleep.” Without the oil, Mrs Oates can only remain upright for 15 minutes at a time before she begins vomiting and her pain moves from acute to chronic. And Mr Oates’ $115 fortnightly carers’ pension — once used to pay for his wife’s multiple medications — has gone back into the household budget. Mr Oates said he hoped Health Minister Michael Ferguson “educates himself fully on the benefits”.

The doctor at the centre of the Queensland COVID-19 vaccine dose bungle was previously sanctioned over inappropriate prescription of medical cannabis. Sujoy Roychowdhury was banned from possessing or prescribing medicinal cannabis, The Australian reports. Under his conditions, employers could be required to file monthly reports to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) to confirm he complies with the sanctions. Dr Roychowdhury was employed via Health Care Australia (HCA), which was contracted to administer COVID-19 vaccines across NSW and Queensland. RELATED: Queensland vaccine overdosing incident, doctor stood down A spokesman for HCA told NCA NewsWire that while it was aware of the restrictions on Dr Roychowdhury’s licence, they did not bar him from administering the doses. “The doctor involved in the nursing home incident is a registered medical practitioner on the APHRA register and there were no conditions on the doctor’s registration which prevented him ­administering vaccinations,” they said. Dr Roychowdhury administered four times the recommended dosage to two elderly patients, a 94-year old woman and an 88-year old man, in Brisbane on Tuesday. He was stood down after a nurse noticed and reported the mistake. Neither patient suffered any ill effects, though the man had lifesaving heart surgery delayed as a precaution.  Dr Roychowdhury had failed to complete mandatory online training before administering the doses, and HCA CEO Jason Cartwright agreed to step aside while an investigation was launched. The government was infuriated by the bungle, which deputy chief medical officer Michael Kidd lashed as “unacceptable”. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said she was “very upset” over the error. “This doctor had no training – now we have two elderly people that could be anyone’s mother or father, or aunt or uncle, that are now in hospital,” she said. “I don’t want to see this happen again. Let’s make sure the training happens. It’s too crucial.” HCA initially informed the federal government Dr Roychowdhury had completed his online training, before changing that advice. The government was infuriated by the development, which forced Health Minister Greg Hunt to correct the record in parliament. But Prime Minister Scott Morrison played down the incident, saying while hiccups were unavoidable in any “vaccination program of this scale”, measures were in place to correct them. “Where things don’t go completely to plan, they’re quickly addressed, as you’ve seen happen this week,” he said. The comments came just hours before a second bungle was revealed. On Friday, 150 doses of the vaccine were discarded because it could not be guaranteed they were stored at the correct subzero temperature. The incident occurred after the doses were erroneously delivered to a Melbourne aged care centre, which received double the required number of doses.

LAST month’s federal law change making it legal for Australian patients and doctors to access medicinal cannabis has changed nothing for Jeremy Bester and his family. Mr Bester’s mother Lyn Cleaver and her partner Malcolm Amundsen already provide him with spoonfuls of home-grown cannabinoid extracts, which they say are better than pharmaceuticals at reducing the frequency and intensity of his epileptic fits without side effects. The fits are a legacy of a viral illness Mr Bester contracted at age six. Ms Cleaver said Police Minister Rene Hidding had assured her police would not actively seek to prosecute people who grew and possessed cannabis for genuine medical reasons, but the stigma and perceived risk of breaking the law was deterring many other Tasmanians. She said the legislative amendment made by Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley with Labor and Greens support had been a step in the right direction, but it only sanctioned commercial cannabis production, and cannabis extraction research by pharmaceutical companies. “I can’t see anything happening in under five years,’’ Ms Cleaver said. FEDERAL LEGISLATION BID She said medicinal cannabis advocates were continuing to push the Tasmanian Government to establish a register, for the protection of Tasmanians who had genuine medicinal reasons for growing or possessing cannabis. “People are too frightened — it could be their job, the type of work they do,’’ she said. Labor’s shadow attorney general Lara Giddings last month said a Labor government would decriminalise cannabis use and possession for medicinal purposes. Health Minister Michael Ferguson said his government would amend state legislation, if necessary, to ensure that the federal law changes could be applied in the state. “We have also joined forces with NSW to explore opportunities for cultivation and harvesting. This also opens the door for Tasmanians to take part in their clinical trials,’’ Mr Ferguson said.

SHOULD the recreational use of cannabis be legalised in Australia, the market would be worth more an estimated $5 billion annually. That’s the finding of in-depth analysis by the global firm New Frontier Data, which looked at current illicit usage rates and comparable global regulated industries to model what a possible future legal marijuana market would look like. Cannabis is the most widely used drug in the country, with 12 per cent of people reporting having used it in the past year. At the moment, the black market is worth at least $4.5 billion a year — all of which goes into the pockets of criminals and organised gangs, the Oceania Cannabis Report found. There has been a growing movement calling for recreational cannabis use to be decriminalised, on the back of several American states and Canada. If Australia followed suit, the total market — combining recreational and medicinal use — would be worth $5.5 billion annually.  After successful lobbying, medicinal marijuana has become legal for certain sufferers of chronic illness and disease. However, the high cost, low availability and strict regulations mean take-up has been lacklustre, the New Frontier Data report said. “As of September 2018, there were just over 1000 medical cannabis patients registered in Australia, which is a significantly lower patient participation rate than commonly seen in other legal medical cannabis markets.” Based on its data set, the report estimates that the medical cannabis patient population in Australia could hit 330,000 by 2050. The cost of medicinal cannabis has dropped by 50 per cent in the past year, but approved Australian patients still pay almost a quarter above what illegal marijuana costs. More suppliers are needed to bring down prices, but strict regulation has seen market growth slow. The latest government research on community attitudes to cannabis found many people are more progressive in their views than the current laws reflect. According to the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 84 per cent of Australians are in favour of legislation allowing the use of medicinal cannabis. However, there is far less support for sanctioned recreational use of the drug, with 35 per cent of people in favour of change. Support is more widespread among young people, with half of people aged 18 to 39 comfortable with regulating and taxing cannabis, but older Aussies are staunchly opposed. But regardless, 73 per cent of people don’t support cannabis possession being a crime. Currently, being caught with cannabis in Australia is a crime, but several states consider possessing a very small amount for personal use to be illegal but not a criminal offence. The vast majority of police activity in regards to drugs is for cannabis offences, and nine-in-10 arrests are of users rather than growers, distributors and dealers. Opponents of decriminalising recreational use fear it will encourage greater use of the drug, particularly among younger people. However, Nicole Lee from Curtin University’s National Drug Research Institute wrote in  The Conversation that there is no evidence to support that fear. A number of studies have shown there are health ramifications associated with significant regular use, including a doubling of the risk of psychotic symptoms in extreme cases. It can cause anxiety and depression and according to drug reform organisation The Ted Noffs Foundation, it can be addictive. Teenagers who use cannabis tend to have poorer educational outcomes, driving while under the influence of cannabis almost doubles the risk of accidents and women who smoke while pregnant can damage their baby’s health. At the end of the day, using cannabis has an inebriating effect, which has a range of consequences on its own. Proponents of legalising recreational cannabis use argue the benefits are many, including reducing harm by regulating the drug and its production, ensuring a consistency in potency. It could also result in less risky behaviours when the threat of criminal prosecution is removed. Matt Noffs said prohibition usually causes more damage and the smarter option was to take control of the health and safety risks with strong regulation. A recent study found that recreational drug use has become much more mainstream in Australia, especially when it comes to cannabis. But the issue of legalising recreational cannabis use was raised in Australia recently, after Canada’s move to completely decriminalise it. Prime Minister Scott Morrison was asked if he would follow suit and his response was a resounding no.

She has Dravet syndrome — a rare and catastrophic form of epilepsy. LITTLE Katelyn Lambert’s parents say only the legalisation of medical cannabis can save her life. The two-year-old, who can suffer up to 1400 seizures a day, has Dravet syndrome — a rare and catastrophic form of epilepsy.  She has been hospitalised nine times in the past four months and faces a bleak ­future with severe retardation, disability and premature death likely. “We dread what the next seizure will do to her,” father Michael says. “She even has seizures in her sleep.” Mr Lambert said research had revealed medical cannabis was enormously beneficial for epileptics because of its main ingredients THC and CBD. A CBD strain, known as Charlotte’s Web, was developed in America to help Dravet sufferer Charlotte Figi, who had been suffering from 300 seizures a week ­before starting on the drug. Mr Lambert said Charlotte now suffered from only two or three seizures a month, no longer needed a feeding tube and could walk and talk. “We estimate Katelyn needs about 3g of Charlotte’s Web cannabis a day, about $12,000 a year on today’s market,” Mr Lambert said. “That’s about 20 plants per annum to potentially save her life and save NSW taxpayers a fortune. We use lignocaine from cocaine, we use morphine from opium, why can’t we use THC and CBD from cannabis?” Mr Lambert has approached Gosford state Liberal MP Chris Holstein to argue the case to legalise medical cannabis in NSW. Tamworth National Party MP Kevin Anderson plans to introduces a Private Member’s Bill, possibly as soon as the September sitting. “It’s a no-brainer. Vote yes to help sick people dying from cancer or epileptics or vote no to continue the present system where medicine is either grow by drug dealers or families are criminalised for giving their loved ones medicine,” Mr Lambert said. Mr Holstein said he would consult with people affected and the wider electorate before making any decision. “I met the Lambert family in my office a few weeks ago and after meeting their daughter and hearing their story I am sympathetic to their situation,” Mr Holstein said. “I will be adopting a positive approach to any proposed legislation and looking closely at the safeguards and regulation of medicinal cannabis as it applies to this and similar extreme cases in the state. “I believe it is our responsibility as legislators to assess the evidence put before us by the medical experts, listen to the people affected and their families and consult within the wider electorate.’’ Originally published as Medical marijuana the key to little Katelyn Lambert’s survival: She suffers up to 1400 seizures a day To join the conversation, please

CHANGES in laws relating to growing medicinal cannabis come into effect today but users dependent on the drug for pain relief say not enough is being done to assist them to get access to the help they need. Farmers will this week be able to apply for a permit to grow cannabis for use in medicinal products. And the State Government is on track to allow doctors to prescribe the drug next year. But a local medicinal cannabis campaigner has called the State Government naive for not providing a more immediate response for Tasmanians using the drug for medicinal reasons. From Tuesday, cannabis will be reclassified from a prohibited drug to a controlled one, opening up the opportunities for Tasmanian farmers to apply for a licence to grow the crop. Health Minister Michael Ferguson has told the Sunday Tasmanian that farmers will need to meet a high standard of security around the crop and demonstrate that protections are in place to prevent any part of the crop or its products being diverted to illegal uses. “The Australian Government will be fully responsible for running the licence scheme but arrangements are in place to ensure close links to local law enforcement and to ensure that crops are only grown in appropriate locations.” Kingston woman Nicole Cowles has been using a cannabinoid tincture to help treat the seizures that have plagued her daughter Alice since infancy. Ms Cowles said the Government needed to provide greater protection for local users and a registration scheme that could start immediately. “I think the Government should have an access scheme where we have patients register and there can be registered growers and suppliers,” she said. Ms Cowles said people were accessing cannabis from a “growing underground”, where there was no quality control and laws were being broken. Mr Ferguson said the State Government was on track to establish a controlled access scheme to allow Tasmanians with serious, unresponsive medical conditions to access medicinal cannabis products when prescribed by a specialist doctor.  He has warned these steps have nothing to do with legalising general use of the drug. “Later next week, Labor will debate a motion at its state conference to decriminalise cannabis and give a free pass to drug dealers and criminals,” he said. “We want to make sure that where there is a medical need, we look at that but we also know that cannabis is a dangerous gateway drugand we absolutely oppose decriminalisation.’’ Originally published as Cannabis users in call for protection To join the conversation, please

Here’s a sneak peek inside the top-secret facility. AUSTRALIA’S first cannabis farms are expected to be providing medical marijuana by next year. Medifarm, located in the Sunshine Coast, opened its doors to reporters recently to show the healthy plants in their facility. “I know what this plant can do, my neighbour was cured,” Medifarm master grower Steffen Kraushaar said. “So I dedicated my career to use cannabis under legal circumstances and it is really exciting now.” Mr Kraushaar moved to Australia eight years ago from Belgium and studied horticulture as part of his dream to be part of the legal industry. The cannabis oil produced from the plants at the farm will be used to help Australians with conditions like epilepsy, chronic pain, multiple sclerosis or those needing paediatric care. According to the Sunshine Coast Daily, Medifarm managing director Adam Benjamin said it was the same medicine that was once used worldwide for centuries. “If you turn to look at the history books, up until 1937, cannabis was the most widely-prescribed medicine,” Mr Benjamin said. “But the American Doctors Association went ballistic. They decided to stop doctors from prescribing it. “The 1898 manual, is still the leading manual and the treatment for medical cannabis back then is still the same now.” US-based researchers have named a planet 12 light years away which could hold the key to finding extraterrestrial activity.

A PARLIAMENTARY inquiry into legalisation of cannabis for medical purposes is expected to receive a huge response when it opens for submissions this week. A major Tasmanian poppy processor yesterday voiced support for a trial despite the State Government citing poppy industry opposition as one of the reasons for opposing any trials. TPI Enterprises managing ­director Jarrod Ritchie said yesterday he could not understand the Government’s logic.  The Cressy-based company makes poppy straw concentrate. Mr Ritchie said he could not understand why poppy growers’ representatives would oppose a Tasmanian trial.  “Given the ­expertise we have with narcotics, which it could be argued are more dangerous than medicinal hemp or THC, I would be surprised that we wouldn’t at least look at it,” Mr Ritchie said. “There’s already an industry globally ... Canada and the UK are already producing it. This is another own goal for Tasmania. Someone will do it, whether it’s another state or ­another country, why wouldn’t we do it?’’  Independent MLC Ruth Forrest said the announcement of the Legislative Council inquiry had already generated a significant response, mostly in favour of a trial. Ms Forrest said the issue was well worth exploring in detail.  She said some people were concerned about the idea of a trial because they thought it would involve a move to legalise cannabis for recreational use. Premier Will Hodgman said the Legislative Council had every right to hold an inquiry but the Government was sticking by its decision not to hold a trial.

THE law which supposedly bans the production, sale and use of marijuana in Tasmania is an ass. The police rarely if ever charge anyone for possessing or using small quantities of cannabis — certainly less than 50 grams — and will merely issue a warning. This can apply not only to first- but also second- and even third-time users. The courts, likewise, don’t really take cannabis use or possession terribly seriously.  Possession of large quantities, even cultivated for commercial purposes, can typically attract only a fine or suspended sentence; and driving under the influence of cannabis will probably attract only a similarly minor penalty, even where it results in a crash in which someone is killed. The Tasmanian authorities have been studiously avoiding any suggestion they might take action against those who — contrary to state laws — have been obtaining and using cannabis oil or tincture as an alternative and very effective drug to treat painful illnesses. TASMANIAN MOTHER DEFENDS MEDICINAL CANNABIS As long as two years ago, I imported a batch of cannabis extract — with the explicit permission of the Therapeutic Goods Administration, and the Australian Customs Service — for use as a medication to treat my symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis. Indeed, I contributed hundreds of dollars to the federal coffers by paying import duty on the marijuana solution, even though I was technically in breach of Tasmanian law by even possessing the drug. Because of a loophole — which means that although possession and use of cannabis in any form is a criminal offence in Tasmania and most other states — my GP was able to get permission from federal drug authorities for me to import a cannabis spray called Sativex from England, where it is supplied legally, as it is in other countries including New Zealand, Canada, France and the United States. Sativex is sprayed under the tongue and has proved useful for many people with MS, relieving neuropathic pain and spasms. NURSES BACK MEDICINAL CANNABIS TRIAL It cost me about $1700 (plus a couple of hundred dollars in import duty) for about a month’s supply.  I frankly didn’t find the benefit anywhere near worth the cost or the trouble of going through the import process, although I recognise that many people do get great benefit from it. I have also tried smoking marijuana and eating cannabis cookies. Again, the benefit to me was not worth the trouble or the cost, and I have stuck with more conventional drugs.  However, I know of other people living with MS who get enormous benefits from pot, in whatever their chosen form. It is clearly time the law was changed to recognise the fact that marijuana is commonly used, both recreationally and as a beneficial medicine — and that the law is recognised more in the breach than in its observance.  Surveys have regularly shown that about one-third of Australians have used marijuana, with one in 10 having used it recently. Political parties treat the issue with kid gloves.  Labor, during its 16 years in power in Tasmania, was so terrified of offending anyone that it ignored the issue, even though many Labor MPs privately supported the view that cannabis would be best decriminalised, controlled and taxed.  GROOM RULES OUT CANNABIS JOBS The new Right-wing and timorous Liberal Government had barely been sworn in when it was assuring Tasmanians there would be no change to the status quo under Will Hodgman’s watch. The Hodgman Government even drummed out of town a potentially valuable job-creating and tax-paying cannabinoid business that wanted to cultivate a marijuana plantation for medical cannabis.  Labor — which in power completely ignored the issue — pilloried the new Government as weak for not agreeing to at least a trial of medical cannabis. Unexpectedly and without explanation, conservative Health Minister Michael Ferguson suddenly changed his mind and supported a trial of medical marijuana.  GREEN LIGHT FOR MEDICINAL CANNABIS TRIAL With Prime Minister Tony Abbott announcing to the world that he supported use of cannabis for medical reasons and the Liberal governments of Victoria and New South Wales both indicating support for a change in the law, Hodgman announced he would raise the issue at the next meeting of the Council of Australian Governments. Meanwhile, the Legislative Council — often considered a bastion of conservatism, but prompted by the highly respected progressive independent MLC Ruth Forrest — has been having a committee inquiry into allowing the use of medical marijuana. What is clear — from evidence collected by the Forrest Committee, anecdotal evidence from a host of people around Australia who have recently been publicly testifying to how the use of medical marijuana has changed their lives for the better, and the use of cannabis medicinally in many other countries — is that we do not need a medical trial. Even the conservative PM has acknowledged that, given the research, tests and experience of many countries, Australia does not need yet another trial. EDITORIAL: PAIN RELIEF INTO CONTEXT Safe and reliable jurisdictions in other countries have done that job for us, and all we need do is recognise that cannabis extracts can be taken safely and should be on the list of drugs that doctors can prescribe. As a first step the State Government should fall in line with its federal counterpart, and remove the blanket prohibition of cannabis from the statutes, so it can be produced locally rather than imported at huge expense from the UK.  Cannabis should be recognised as a beneficial drug. It is far less harmful than the most abused recreational drug, alcohol, and in pharmaceutical use is far safer than, for instance, opioids which are grown safely under strict controls in Tasmania.  Unlike morphine and heroin, marijuana never killed anyone from an overdose. The Government should go further and allow the recreational use of marijuana in Tasmania. Better to license, control and tax the drug — now purchased illegally by thousands of Tasmanians who pay exorbitant prices to drug dealers, but who have no idea of the quality and potency of what they are buying. The drug money would go to far better use if collected to benefit the State Treasury, and if grown and sold under licence, the drug’s quality and strength could be regulated.

AUSTRALIANS are expected to consume as much as 8000kg of medical cannabis worth $100 million in just the first year of being legalised, according to a study by the University of Sydney. The figure, contained in a white paper produced by the University of Sydney Business School and medical cannabis company MGC Pharmaceuticals, is based on data from existing markets including Israel, Canada and the Netherlands. The paper, Medicinal Cannabis in Australia: Science, Regulation and Industry, is the first of its kind to examine the logistic and economic, as well as medinical benefits of a local medicinal cannabis industry. The federal Parliament passed legislation allowing for the cultivation of medicinal cannabis last month, and regulations governing production under licence are now being drafted. Medicinal cannabis, already a $250 billion global industry, is expected to help tens of thousands of patients in Australia suffering from medical conditions including epilepsy, cancer, multiple sclerosis and chronic pain. Earlier this month, the global president of Canadian firm Tilray predicted medical marijuana had the potential to be a billion-dollar industry in Australia and create thousands of skilled jobs. University of Sydney Business School associate lecturer Michael Katz said the study’s lower figure was for the first year alone.  “We’re talking $100 million in year one, that’s the latent demand that’s already there,” he said.  “We’re not talking about increased uptake, exports, and that doesn’t include the next tech billionaire who develops an app [to tap into the market].” Mr Katz said Australia was uniquely positioned to scale production to become a world leader in exports, rivalling producers such as Mongolia. “I think Australia has a competitive advantage against most of these countries,” he said. “Australian agricultural products in general are considered clean, green and we have a strong rule of law.”  The authors worked closely with MGC to understand the demand side and private sector economics of the industry to come to its estimate. “There’s a lot more to a new industry like medical cannabis than you might immediately think,” Mr Katz said.  “You’ve got the technical agriculture side of it, the medical processes such as extraction and dosage, the technology side such as scalable standardisation tools, supply chain logistics and so on. “Obviously this will lead to important health outcomes for a wide variety of people. For example, it could provide considerable relief for those suffering from epilepsy. “However, we’re also going to see employment and wealth creation opportunities in all of the sectors that will come together to facilitate a medical cannabis market, so it’s about much more than just the medical benefits.” The authors said 51,000sq m of greenhouse space, or “three times the size of the Sydney Cricket Ground” would be needed to produce the amount of cannabis required to meet demand. MGC Pharmaceuticals managing director Nativ Segev said the study confirmed the strong need for developing a medicinal cannabis industry in Australia. “MGC Pharma has both the growing know-how and genetic expertise to be at the forefront this industry, helping tens of thousands of Australians suffering from a broad range of conditions,” he said. frank.chung@news.com.au A Melbourne building firm has slashed its headcount for the second time in six months, just a few days after another major construction company collapsed.

We get the experts’ verdict. KETAMINE, LSD, marijuana and MDMA cast the most destructive of shadows. In fact, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare estimates that illicit drug use costs this country’s economy $8.2 billion a year in productivity loss, law enforcement and health care. The toll paid by family, friends and the drug users themselves is incalculable. And yet some of the drugs that wreak havoc on our population have shown real promise in the labs.  In some cases, they provide relief for sufferers of conditions where medical science has made few inroads to date. The new studies have, at this stage, been confined to small groups of subjects, and large-scale testing is still years away — as is the idea that your GP or specialist will be able to write out a script for a drug more associated with the street than your medical practice. What’s more, the potential for misuse and addiction can’t be underestimated when it comes to weighing up any potential benefits, especially when you consider the prescription opioid crisis both here and overseas.   MORE STORIES  SIX NEWBORNS INFECTED AS DEADLY ‘SUPERBUG’  MEDIEVAL MAGGOT TREATMENT USED TO SAVE LIMBS FROM AMPUTATION Yet minds are slowly changing, as we’ve seen with the incremental legalisation of marijuana for strictly vetted use in some treatments. We look at the uses, risks and expert verdicts of drugs with medical potential.  MDMA  WHAT IS IT? Commonly known as ‘ecstasy’ or more recently ‘molly’, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a stimulant and hallucinogen. It’s generally consumed as a tablet and was originally formulated to assist in the control of bleeding (not appetite, as the urban myth goes).  MEDICAL USES: Combining MDMA and psychotherapy can significantly improve symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), according to a 2018 study published in the journal The Lancet Psychiatry.  The small but groundbreaking research found that of the 24 people with PTSD who were given MDMA in varying doses, 16 no longer met the criteria for PTSD at the end of 12 months.  It’s one of several studies to show benefits, which has prompted the US Food and Drug Administration to allow MDMA trials to enter phase three — the final step before it’s legally available to patients.  DANGERS: Some of ecstasy’s myriad nasties, as listed by the American National Institute of Drug Abuse, include: high blood pressure, panic attacks, a dangerous rise in body temperature, heart damage (with regular use) and the tendency to engage in high-risk sexual behaviour.  THE EXPERT’S VERDICT: Dr Gillinder Bedi, a psychologist at Orygen, The National Centre of Excellence in Youth Mental Health in Victoria, says: “The next few years will be critical to see if MDMA joins the ranks of failed psychiatric treatments, or offers new hope to people suffering from PTSD.”  KETAMINE  WHAT IS IT? This white powder is used by medical practitioners and vets as an anaesthetic and pre-anaesthetic. Its hallucinatory properties also make it popular at festivals and dance parties. It’s generally inhaled through the nose.  MEDICAL USES: Research published in the American Journal of Psychiatry in April found that ketamine has “shown promise” as a rapid treatment for those with severe depression and thoughts of self-harm.  Of the 68 suicidal people in the trial — all of whom were treated with a hospital stay and antidepressants the half who were prescribed ketamine showed a much greater improvement in their symptoms.  The effects levelled off at 25 days, which is roughly the time at which standard antidepressant medications begin to take effect.  DANGERS: According to the online drug and alcohol information resource portal Positive Choices, ketamine carries a threat of addiction, kidney damage, mental health issues, panic attacks and overdose.  THE EXPERT’S VERDICT: Professor Colleen Loo, from the University of NSW, who trialled ketamine in a world-first research project, says: “We have something that’s emerging as a potentially incredibly useful treatment. I’d hate to see it get derailed by careless or premature use.”  LSD & PSILOCYBIN  WHAT ARE THEY? Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin (AKA magic mushrooms) are, respectively, chemically manufactured and naturally-occurring hallucinogenics. They are most often ingested orally.  MEDICAL USES: A 2016 study by New York University in the US found that a single dose of psilocybin lifted the depression felt by cancer patients and this effect could last for up to eight months. Researchers described the findings as “unprecedented”. Meanwhile, a team from Pompeu Fabra University in Spain found that in people with depression or PTSD, moderate doses of LSD prompted areas of the brain that otherwise might not work together to “harmonise”.  DANGERS: The Alcohol and Drug Foundation lists LSD’s effects as headaches, vomiting, irregular heartbeat and chills, with overdoses encompassing “panic, psychosis and increased risk-taking”. It notes similar dangers associated with psilocybin.  THE EXPERT’S VERDICT: Assistant Professor Kelan Thomas from Touro University in the US, who has reviewed several studies of psilocybin, says: “Psilocybin-assisted therapies may be significantly better than current treatments which only demonstrate small to moderate effect sizes.”  He says it’s particularly helpful for those who haven’t responded to therapy or medication.  MARIJUANA  WHAT IS IT? The leaves and stems of the marijuana plant are smoked; the resin (hash) is consumed or smoked.  MEDICAL USES: Last year, the Federal Government legalised strict access to marijuana for patients suffering chronic pain, cancer, multiple sclerosis and epileptic seizures. But it may also help treat Alzheimer’s disease.  US researchers found that an active compound in marijuana helps to remove toxic clumps of amyloid beta protein in the brain, which are thought to kickstart the disease.  DANGERS: According to the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, marijuana can result in breathing problems, increased heart rate, nausea, depression and anxiety, not to mention lung damage caused by smoking it.  THE EXPERTS’ VERDICT: In a statement published in the Medical Journal of Australia earlier this year, professors Adrian Reynolds, Jennifer Martin and Yvonne Bonomo from the Royal Australasian College of Physicians said: “The pace and scale of the introduction of medicinal cannabis are unprecedented and have raised challenges for health professionals.”  They added that its introduction “has not followed the usual research-based safety and effectiveness processes”, and this could potentially lead to an addiction epidemic as seen with the use of opioids in the treatment of chronic pain.

NSW Premier Mike Baird has been heckled at an event in Sydney and accused of moving too slowly on medicinal cannabis. Baird was confronted by dying patients and their carers at a medicinal cannabis conference in Sydney on Saturday where he gave the opening address. The NSW Government is currently running a number of clinical trials of medical cannibals and it’s use for people with, terminal illnesses, chemotherapy-induced nausea and children with severe epilepsy. During his speech, at the United in Compassion Medicinal Cannabis Symposium, members of the audience heckled Mr Baird, whose government has applied for a licence to grow the medicinal crop under a national scheme, shouting that progress was “too slow” and that “children dying’s a reality”.  “I assure you we are moving as quickly as we can,” Mr Baird told the conference. “With everything I have, and every resource in government, we are doing everything we can ... to make it as effective as we possibly can, to give access as quickly as we possibly can.”  The conference was organised by Tamworth mother Lucy Haslam, who lost her 25-year-old son to cancer this year.  Daniel Haslam used cannabis to relieve his symptoms in his five-year battle with the disease. Ms Haslam’s campaign for change was rewarded in February when federal parliament passed laws allowing the cultivation of medicinal cannabis.  But she expressed concerns people who use medicinal cannabis were still considered to be breaking the law. She said there was a need for compassion around the subject. “The harsh reality is they are still facing an additional burden because they remain criminals,” she told the audience. “This is untenable.  “Cannaboid research is clearly an area where science has not kept up due to a myriad of reasons, predominantly prohibition and the war on drugs.  Following his address, Mr Baird was confronted by 20-year-old wheelchair-bound Stiff Person’s Syndrome sufferer Ben Oakley, who said he had been taking cannabis oil.  “Honestly, I don’t know where I’d be without the oil. The oil has saved my life,” Mr Oakley told Mr Baird.  “I’ve only had three spasms in the 11-and-a-half months I’ve been on the oil.”  Mr Baird announced the state government’s Terminal Illness Cannabis Scheme will be renamed to the Medical Cannabis Compassionate Use Scheme.  A search is currently underway in a state’s high country, where an Irish hiker has reportedly been missing for days.

CANNABIS should be approved for medicinal use to help people suffering chronic pain, advocates have told a NSW parliamentary committee. Cancer survivor Sally Crossing told a public hearing at parliament house on Monday it appeared self-evident that cannabis relieved pain for many sufferers. ""It's just a matter of being kind and helpful to people who need help,"" said Ms Crossing, who is the deputy chair of the volunteer advocacy group Cancer Voices NSW. The committee is inquiring into the feasibility and safety of using cannabis as a medicine, the legal implications and how cannabis could be supplied to patients. Ms Crossing said her group was in favour of medicinal cannabis use with the proper legal and medical protocols and assurance of safe delivery. She said stronger drugs classed as illegal had long been approved for medicinal use without problems. ""Too many people think it's the thin end of the wedge or the beginning of the slippery slope,"" Ms Crossing said. She said other painkillers could have severe side-effects whereas cannabis could do the job without side effects, as shown in some states in the United States. Lesley Brydon, who has suffered severe arthritic pain and is CEO of the advocacy group Pain Australia, told the inquiry her organisation was in favour of approved therapeutic cannabis products being legally available. ""I personally would not want to smoke a joint,"" she said, noting that pills would deliver more measurable doses. Ms Brydon said the majority of people suffering severe pain in Australia did not have access to adequate pain management and many were dying agonising deaths. To join the conversation, please

A QUEENSLAND trial evaluating the benefits of medical cannabis for people with advanced cancer will be part of a $69 million boost to fight the disease. The Federal Government will invest the money in world-leading medical researchers to target devastating and rare conditions like acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in infants, aplastic anaemia, multiple sclerosis and Huntington’s disease.  The University of Queensland will receive $1.4 million to better define the role of medicinal cannabis for cancer patients in palliative care, and look at how patients with advanced cancer can benefit from the drug. The university will also be given $1.6 million for Professor Maher Gandhi to evaluate an “innovative triple therapy regimen” for patients with primary and secondary brain lymphoma. Another trial at the university will provide evidence on the best way to treat the rare infection Mycobacterium Abscessus Complex (MABSC). The trials are mainly aimed at improving survival rates for rare cancers, which have remained unchanged for years, at the same time as rates for more common cancers have improved. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said the investment was a significant boost from the $13 million originally flagged when the government called for applications. “For people living with a rare disease and the medical professionals treating them, there are significant challenges including diagnostic delays, lack of available treatments and difficulty in finding the appropriate care,” Mr Hunt said. “We are committed to continuing to investment in research to find the answers to these challenges. “The overwhelming response to this Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) clinical trial grant round demonstrates that there is plenty of research talent and enthusiasm to tackle rare cancers and rare diseases.” Originally published as Queensland trial evaluating benefits of medical cannabis for cancer patients To join the conversation, please

PREMIER Annastacia Palaszczuk will today announce Queensland’s first medicinal cannabis trial, saying she has been particularly moved by stories of children with drug-resistant epilepsy. Ms Palaszczuk said Queensland would join forces with the NSW Government – which last year announced scientific trials for patients with intractable epilepsy, chemotherapy-­related nausea and end-of-life pain where standard treatments were ineffective. She spoke to NSW Premier Mike Baird about the trials during Friday’s Council of Australian Government meeting in Canberra. “I didn’t want Queensland standing on the sidelines,” Ms Palaszczuk said yesterday.  “I wanted us to be an active participant because I know many Queensland families see real value in this form of treatment.” Ms Palaszczuk said details of the Queensland trial would be worked out during discussions with NSW experts. “This trial is about letting the experts do as much research as possible into this issue so that we can all get a clearer understanding of any clinical benefits medicinal cannabis can provide,” she said.  “I’m especially interested in any benefits this form of treatment can have on kids with severe epilepsy.” The Premier said she spoke with the mother of a boy with uncontrollable epilepsy before flying to the COAG meeting. “All she wants is a government that’s willing to step up and investigate this form of treatment,” Ms Palaszczuk said.  “My Government will make that commitment.” Mr Baird has committed up to $9 million over five years for the NSW trials, with enrolment expected to start next year. Ms Palaszczuk is yet to indicate how much Queensland will contribute. An expert panel chaired by NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant will oversee the trials.  Details about where the me­dicinal cannabis for the trials will be sourced are still be­ing worked out. Use of me­dicinal cannabis is decriminalised in 23 US states, Canada, ­Israel, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and Spain. Epilepsy Queensland ­yesterday applauded the Government’s decision to conduct a trial, describing it as a “significant step”. “The news of the willingness of our government to be open-minded and par­ticipate in medical trials will be very welcome indeed, particularly so for people ­living with refractory epilepsy,” Epilepsy Queensland chief executive Helen Whitehead said. CAUTION: Qld’s ‘wait and see’ approach COMMENT: High time it was legalised “Families who deal with relentless seizures that are not assisted by existing medications, surgery and other treatments will see this as a major step in the future care of their child’s epilepsy. “These families have desperately sought support for medical marijuana in the hope that it could be a possible treatment option for their child, administered with medical support and without fear of persecution.” The trials come as desperate families defy the law to give their children medicinal cannabis oil, hoping it will control their seizures. Some have gone public, saying their children have become seizure free.  Doctors warn the drug will not help every patient with refractory epilepsy and much more research is needed to pinpoint the components in cannabis that may work for some children. Last chance is heading south CHARLOTTE Miot’s parents have considered giving up their jobs and moving to NSW so she can be treated with medicinal cannabis without the threat of police or child-safety officers knocking at their door. Seven-year-old Charlotte has been in and out of hospital most of her life with seizures caused by the rare disorder Doose Syndrome. Although she takes five epilepsy drugs, they have failed to control her seizures.  She has been admitted to the Lady ­Cilento Children’s Hospital in Brisbane twice during the school holidays alone. “We have started looking at real estate and schools in NSW,” Charlotte’s mother Rebecca said. “We’d like to try medicinal cannabis oil under medical supervision. It may not work but we’d like to at least try it. It would be another option. Without it, we’ve run out of options.” The Miots were heartened by NSW Premier Mike Baird’s move to change police guidelines to allow officers to ­decline to prosecute patients using cannabis products for medical purposes. They were waiting to see the Palaszczuk Government’s response to a petition, lodged in the Queensland Parliament last month, calling for similar protections here. “We would prefer to stay in Queensland,” Ms Miot said.  “We don’t want to have to pack up our lives and start again somewhere else.” She and her husband Mark have welcomed Ms Palaszczuk’s move to include Queensland in medicinal cannabis trials. “I’m impressed that something is actually happening in Queensland,” Ms Miot said.  “We’ve got to do something for these kids. If it’s not Charlotte, it may help the next lot of kids that come through.” The Brisbane nurse said the medical cannabis issue was misunderstood by many in the community.  She said products given to children with drug-resistant epilepsy were ingested as an oil, not smoked. “I’ve even had other nurses ask me: ‘Do you believe if she smokes pot, she’ll be better?’,” Ms Miot said.  “I’ve told them it’s nothing like that. It’s very different.” She said when she asked one of Charlotte’s doctors his opinion about medical cannabis, his response was “no comment”.  “It’d be nice to be able to talk to someone that knew the science behind it and knew how it works,” Ms Miot said. The Miots are hopeful that Charlotte will be included in the Queensland trial. Editorial: Brave move is dope THE Palaszczuk Government should be commended for its courageous stance to trial medicinal cannabis to help the acutely ill.  It will no doubt court controversy, especially with the uninformed who will see it as the start of the liberalisation of drug laws.  Medicinal cannabis use has already been introduced in a number of Western countries, with terrific results. There is strong evidence showing it can reduce severe pain in cancer patients, epilepsy sufferers and those with neurological disease. What this trial does is allow the seriously ill to access medicinal marijuana without the stigma of having to acquire it illegally.  Strict regulations will govern who can and cannot access the drug. With NSW also embracing the trial, it’s a victory for good policy and common sense. Originally published as Queensland to trial medical marijuana To join the conversation, please

AUSTRALIA is facing “big change” to laws around cannabis, with Queensland leading the way on helping sick people access the currently illegal drug. Queensland Health Minister Cameron Dick told Triple M Brisbane’s Marto and Ed Kavalee for Breakfast this morning that there was “growing demand” for the move. The Bill, which was released online for public consultation last night, will formalise the process by which doctors can prescribe medicinal cannabis to patients. “It’s going to be a prescribing and dispensing system, so we’ll be authorising doctors to prescribe medicinal cannabis and we’ll be allowing select pharmacists who can control the drug safely to be able to prescribe, so it’s a big change,” Mr Dick said. “Queensland has a lot to give in that space, a great history of agriculture, we’ve got some of the most innovative farmers in the world, we’ve got the right climate, we’ve got the right place and this is something there is growing demand for, the Federal Government’s going to be putting in a licensing process for the production of medicinal cannabis and I think we’re perfectly positioned.” The Bill was praised by Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, who said in a statement: “This Bill will create the most progressive laws in the country.” Mr Dick told Triple M there would still be careful controls around the substance. “We’re not going to limit it necessarily, but cannabis is a narcotic, it’s a dangerous drug and we need to control it effectively and that’s why we’ll be putting that process in place. “I’ll be honest with you, this isn’t about decriminalising marijuana for general use and I don’t want to raise expectation.  “I think there is a debate in that space. In my personal view, I think we’ve got enough trouble to be honest with drugs that are legal at the moment, and look, it’s a conversation that will be ongoing. “But let’s take this step, let’s let people use it for medicinal purposes and then if something good comes out of that, which I know it will, then maybe we can look at those things down the track, but at this stage the government’s view is, let’s go down this path and try and help some people.” Doctors will be able to apply for access to medicinal cannabis, and will require approval from the Queensland Government and Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). Ms Palaszczuk said an expert advisory committee would be formed to guide medical practitioners in assisting patients in obtaining Commonwealth approval of medicinal cannabis products. The move could help patients like 17-year-old Lindsay Carter, from Brisbane, who lives with a brain tumour, intractable epilepsy, chronic pain and nausea. He visited the US four times in 2014, where he received treatment including medicinal marijuana and saw his tumour reduce in size. But when he returned to Australia he stopped using the oil and it grew three millimetres in three months. After a long process, Lindsay was granted the TGA Special Access Scheme late last year and is awaiting final approval, his mother Lanai told news.com.au. The tumour is now shrinking or stable and, while he still has seizures, he has no oedema (watery fluid in cavities) around the brain. A search is currently underway in a state’s high country, where an Irish hiker has reportedly been missing for days.

A SYDNEY pharmacist has weighed into the medical ­marijuana debate, arguing that the systems to import and ­distribute the drug are already in place.  Daryll Knowles, the owner of Australian Custom Pharmaceuticals, said medicinal ­cannabis could easily be ­imported from Holland and administered in the same way as the current methadone ­program. “It’s not such a tough ­hurdle, the systems are already in place to import narcotics like codeine and morphine, the NSW Ministry of Health ­already has processes in place to distribute these, and ­cannabis could be added to that,” he said. Mr Knowles has followed the plight of 24-year-old Dan Haslam, who has incurable bowel cancer and has fortnightly chemotherapy treatments, which cause severe nausea and weight loss.  Since trying cannabis late last year he has not suffered nausea and has been able to eat normally.  His father Lou, a former drug squad detective, and his mother, Lucy, are forced to break the law to get the illegal drug they call miraculous. Health Minister Jillian Skinner knocked back the ­­­pro-medicinal cannabis recommendations of a cross party committee last year.  “The quality and safety of these products cannot be guaranteed,” she said.  However, the Health Minister said she did support the use of ­prescription pharmaceutical cannabis products that were ­approved and regulated by the Therapeutic Goods ­Administration.  Mr Knowles said the Dutch-based company Fag-ron ­already produced medicinal grade cannabis and exported it to other ­European companies. “The process to get it here is there, it is a standardised ­medicinal grade, it is sterilised and comes in little sealed 5g pots that the Dutch ­government sells for €28 ($40),” Mr Knowles said.  Dan’s mother said she was frustrated by politicians who stood in the way.  “You come up with a solution and they just throw up ­another argument, I don’t care how it happens, it just needs to happen,” Lucy Haslam said.

FOR grandfather Barry Lambert this is personal. Cannabis oil from the hemp plants grown in this Hunter Valley crop have been sent to Sydney University for the past year to study in search of a treatment for epilepsy and other conditions. Mr Lambert, a retired financial services billionaire made history last year by donating $33.7 million to Sydney University to set up The Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics.  It was a deeply personal donation because Mr Lambert’s granddaughter suffers a rare form of epilepsy that could kill her.  Now the legacy he hoped to put in place is under threat by law changes as the federal government attempts to control medicinal cannabis.  Mr Lambert said the licensed supplier of the cannabis oil, Ecofibre, will no longer be allowed to supply the university after October 31 because it will then be classified as industrial hemp, not medicinal cannabis.  Industrial hemp has low concentrations of THC, marijuana’s active psychotropic component. Cannabis grown for medicinal purposes will be required to be grown in glass houses. Mr Lambert said the resultant production costs will make an affordable drug expensive. “Imagine the cost of bread and resultant social unrest if we had to grow wheat in a glass house because someone might use it to make alcohol.” Mr Lambert, who is also an investor in Ecofibre, said Sydney University will have to source cannabinoids elsewhere. Last month the state government announced it had been given approval by the Commonwealth to conduct cultivation research which would form the basis of future non-government crops.  The crop will be grown in a $2 million green house at an undisclosed location. Mr Lambert’s four-year-old granddaughter Katelyn suffers from Dravet syndrome, a rare and catastrophic form of epilepsy which leads to up to 1400 seizures a day. Her father Michael is treating her with medicinal cannabis.  Last year Michael was charged with cultivating cannabis to help his daughter. He faces court next month. Ecofibre chief executive Eric Wang said hemp, which they grow in three sites across Australia including the Hunter Valley, still had about 100 useful cannabinoids that could be used for medicine.  Mr Wang said hemp had been caught up in the newly established Office of Drug Control licensing guidelines. “Industrial hemp doesn’t have any narcotic value. If you grow marijuana yes, people can steal it, but we’ve been caught up in this,” he said.  Although a spokeswoman for the Health Department said “no directions or decisions have been undertaken at this time for the cultivation requirements for cannabis,” Mr Wang said the Office of Drug Control (ODC) informed growers of the changes in public consultation sessions held last week through Australia. According to the ODC website, hemp crops and medicinal cannabis crops will have to “maintain strict separation between the two crops”.

A DESPERATE couple accused of snatching their severely disabled four-year-old son from a Queensland Hospital last month are living in a controversial church, where the youngster is being given cannabis oil by a deregistered doctor. Cini Walker and Marc Steven made national headlines when they were accused of taking little Chase Walker from hospital where he was being treated for spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy. Ms Walker and Mr Steven stopped vaccinating their son after the age of two, believing the injections were causing him seizures. The parents advocate the use of medicinal marijuana and an organic diet, which they say has vastly improved his condition and reduced his epileptic seizures. However, Chase has continually been admitted to hospital, with doctors often citing malnutrition. Ms Walker claims the hospital food and western medicine has had an adverse impact on her son’s health. The parents told the Seven Network’s Sunday Night they recently began living at Newcastle’s Church of Ubuntu, where they had been regular visitors, and where Chase was now being treated with cannabis oil.  Sunday Night reported the charismatic church leader, BJ Futter, put Chase on an organic diet and was given doses of cannabis oil. The little boy is being treated by Andrew Katelaris, a deregistered doctor nicknamed “Dr Pot”, who gives the boy cannabis oil through his feeding tube and through his mouth up to four times a day.  Ms Walker and Mr Steven said they saw a dramatic improvement in their son — in contrast to traditional medicine which they felt was making him worse. “I just instantly see him change. You see him start looking like he can concentrate his eyes,” Cini said. “He certainly seems a lot more responsive in the last few days and a lot less traumatised,” Mr Katelaris told Sunday Night. Mr Katelaris worked as a surgeon on Sydney’s north shore until 2005 when he was struck off the medical register for supplying cannabis to friends and relatives, Fairfax reported. In an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald, he said he would continue to treat patients with cannabis oil — even though they suffered serious complications. He vowed to continue to give cannabis to his patients despite by being banned by the Health Care Complaints Commission, saying he answers to “a higher authority”. Asked by Sunday Night about being labelled “Dr Pot”, he said: “I’m proud of what I do ... it’s only a name.” He was challenged on giving doses of THC in cannabis oil — essentially making the child “high”. “Sex can make you high, coffee can make you high, lots of people can make you high, whatever that may mean. I find it a meaningless term and one that doesn’t contribute anything to the debate. In relation to Chase, Ms Walker insisted they were doing the best for their son and just wanted to make sure he had the best — and longest — life possible. “That’s why we’re not turning back, there’s no way I’m going to go backwards. It’s why we’ll keep fighting because we don’t care what other people think and they think we’re wrong,” she said. “We’ve seen the worst of Chase, you know, to see him now it’s completely different.” Mr Steven said even though cannabis was an “illicit drugs” they had researched what other children’s responses to it had been. However, Professor Roy Beran, a neurologist at the University of New South Wales, told the program he could see the bones sticking out of Chase. “The muscles are wasted ... It's just a sad, tragic case.

Low-dose cannabidiol (CBD) can be sold in pharmacies around Australia from today, for the first time without prescription.  The chemical compound – extracted from cannabis – is used to treat a number of health issues, including pain, insomnia and anxiety, and can now be bought over-the-counter after the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved its sale last month.  While the product will only be available to adults in doses of no more than 150 milligrams per day, patients will no longer require a referral or special approval for its legal use.  According to studies, CBD is “rarely associated with severe adverse events, and that non-serious adverse events appear significantly lessened at lower dosages”, the TGA noted.   RELATED: Doctor busts frustrating diet ‘myth’ “The shift to over-the-counter is a huge stepping stone in reducing stigma and encouraging wider societal acceptance around medical cannabis,” Cannabis Doctors Australia (CDA Clinics) founder and clinical director, Dr Ben Jansen, told news.com.au in a statement, adding the move will facilitate better access to those who can benefit from it.  “Stigma is slowly continuing to change as education and information starts to outweigh ignorance and mistruths. 80 year of false stigma takes time to change.”  From what the effects are to whether you can drive afterwards, here’s everything you need to know.   WHAT IS CBD?  Also known as cannabidiol, CBD is a chemical compound originating from the cannabis (also known as marijuana) plant.  The naturally occurring substance can come in the form of an oil, which is manufactured by extracting CBD from the cannabis plant and placing it in a carrier oil, and has gained prominent attention in the health sector and has become an essential part of medicinal marijuana therapy.   WHAT DOES IT DO?  Unlike the THC compound in marijuana, CBD is a non-psychotropic – meaning you won’t be left with a “high” sensation, CDA Clinics said in a statement.  “Low-dose CBD will benefit most patients, especially individuals experiencing chronic pain, anxiety, insomnia, arthritis and inflammatory issues – to name a few,” Dr Jansen said.  “However, if patients find their symptoms persist further, they should seek further advice from a doctor or experienced cannabis doctor. Some patients may find that they need a higher dose or a different CBD product that is only available via a prescription.”  Low-dose CBD has been shown to have benefits in both paediatric and adult patients.  WHO CAN GET IT?  As mentioned above, only adults will be able to purchase cannabidiol over-the-counter without a referral. It will only be available at pharmacies.   Any vaping or topical cream products will still only be available through a prescription from a doctor.  While pharmacies are now allowed to sell it over-the-counter, don’t expect to find any in your local for at least six months, as no CBD oils have been given the green light for sale yet.  Manufacturers are working at a “lightning” rate to get products approved, former president of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, Kos Sclavos, said.   IS IT SUBSIDISED?   CBD will not be subsidised by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) “until more years of data and assessment can be completed”, Dr Jansen said, though some hospitals are paying for the product “in rare and severe cases”.   RELATED: New test to predict mood disorders  HOW DO I TAKE IT?  The most common way to consume CBD is via an oral oil method.  “However, just because we all have feet doesn’t mean we wear the same size shoes and each patient’s dose will vary in regards to one’s symptom response,” CDA Clinics said.  They advise patients “‘start low and go slow’, gradually increasing one’s dose until it is effective”.  It has also recommended users eat something with fat when taking it.  “As CBD is lipophilic, meaning it has an affinity for fat, it can be very helpful to eat something with fat in it when administering CBD, so your body absorbs it at a higher rate, ultimately making it more effective,” they said.  They recommend first eating something with fat in it (like a spoonful of yoghurt, cheese or avocado), then placing a drop on a spoon, putting it underneath your tongue and swallowing after 90 seconds.   HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO WORK?   When ingested, cannabidiol can take hours to absorb, “then the CBD needs days to weeks to have its effects build up and start to work”.  “We recommend at least one week at effective dose to see effects,” CDA Clinics advised.  “However, this can vary person to person, depending on their age, sex, gender, weight, hydration, other medications and use of alcohol.”  Regular dosing typically leads to the most benefits in patients, they added.   RELATED: Crucial test every student must have   ARE THERE SIDE EFFECTS?   Common CBD side effects can include nausea, a dry mouth and diarrhoea.  “These side effects are possible, not probable, and usually self resolve once your body has gotten used to taking a CBD product,” CDA Clinics said.  “This is why it is recommended to take CBD oil with food.”  And while sedation is a very uncommon side effect, it’s worth noting, the group said.   CAN I DRIVE AFTERWARDS?  According to the NSW Government, patients taking cannabidiol-only medicines can lawfully drive as long as they’re not impaired.  Because CBD doesn’t make a person feel stoned or high (when in an isolated form), it’s considered safe to drive on.

A Queensland man caught growing copious amounts of marijuana in his family home has told a court he wants to be “valued in this country” for his work on the drug. Joshua James Waldron’s sentencing took a turn on Thursday after the Caboolture man said he didn’t agree with the prosecution’s claim he grew the drug for commercial purposes. The medicinal marijuana advocate insisted he made no money from his endeavour and instead kept it for “research” and gave it to people who were sick or needed it. “(I) hope one day I’m actually going to be professional and valued in this country for what I do behind cannabis,” he said. Waldron pleaded guilty to one count each of producing and possessing dangerous drugs. Brisbane District Court was told police discovered more than 18kg of marijuana in his house when they searched his property in September last year, most of it packaged in boxes. Waldron told police he grew it for medicinal purposes. Crown prosecutor Siobhan Harrison said a calendar detailing watering schedules was located and Waldron used “sophisticated” property to grow the drugs. Waldron disputed Ms Harrison’s assertion that he received money from people for the drugs. “There was no reason for me to take money from people,” he said. “I received a form of payment in the form of thanks … I never sold (weed), I was too afraid to.” Representing himself, Waldron said he received nothing in exchange for the drug when supplying medicinal marijuana to “hundreds” of people. He said some of the marijuana, including small frozen quantities, was kept for research. “I was doing a phenotype-selection process which gets to the end of good genetics, stable plants,” Waldron said. “It was all different weights and strains, everything was labelled, nothing was intentionally packaged for sale. “Nothing was the same … everything had a particular use or need.” He said he knew his actions were illegal. The court was told some of the packaged drugs weighed differently as they were wet or frozen. In sentencing Waldron – who was supported by his partner and mother – Judge Jennifer Rosengren blasted him for seemingly thumbing his nose at the law due to prior convictions for similar offences. “What’s changed this time? You know it’s a crime, you know you’re doing the wrong thing, and yet here you find yourself back before a court and you want to beg leniency again?” she said. “You can’t keep doing this and expect courts to say ‘don’t worry about it’ when you’re producing cannabis in quantities such as this.” Waldron said it became harder for him to say no to sick people and he had an “idea of grandeur” for the law. The court was told he worked for an alcohol delivery service but would soon start work for a company trying to establish medicinal marijuana centres across Queensland. Judge Rosengren imposed a fine of $5000, ordering him to pay it within nine months or face jail. Convictions were recorded. She took into account his family circumstances, including a baby due in Christmas and a custody battle over his previous relationship, and his mental health challenges.

LILY Poulter vividly remembers the last time her shoulder popped out of its socket.  The nine-year-old was at school, engrossed in a test, when the slightest wrong movement caused the serious pain.  It wasn’t the first time it happened without warning and it will not be the last.  With her gap-toothed smile it would be easy to mistake Lily for a normal girl who adores learning and painting.  Yet she relies on opiate based medications every day to stay on top of her chronic pain caused by Ehlers-Danos Syndrome- a disorder which causes her points to regularly pop out of place.  She also suffers from Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, which overstimulates the nerves, making even the slightest touch painful.  “The lowest pain I have is about a five and the highest is about a nine,” Lily said.  “Every day I haven’t had a break from the pain, it really sucks.” Lily’s parents, Nicole and Lyndon, are one of thousands of families across Australia who are fighting for the legalisation of medicinal cannabis.  Mrs Poulter said she believed the natural form of pain relief would be a better substitute to the addictive and strong medications, including Tramadol and Oxynorm, Lily takes up to four times a day.  “They are opiate based and we all know opiates are highly addictive so I’m dreading the day she actually has to come off it,” she said. “It’s going to a 19-year-old going through the withdrawals of what a normal junkie would.” “It just kills me on a daily basis, just knowing the pain she goes through.”  “Knowing fair well that there is a substance out there which can help her which is natural and won’t give her side effects.” “The worst part of it is that the WA government are doing nothing to help us.”  WA Labor leader Mark McGowan has thrown his support behind the family’s plight to urge the state government to join medicinal cannabis trials taking place across Australia.  “Last year I announced I supported the prescription of medicinal cannabis for people who are terminally ill or in chronic pain in Western Australia,” he said.  “Lily is representative of thousands of West Australians who suffer from chronic pain or who might very unfortunately be terminally ill.” “I think people in that position deserve and need all of the treatments for pain which are out there.”  “The medications Lily is on are related to methadone or heroin or those sorts of drugs, admittedly it’s weaker but it’s related to that,” “We want our State to be a leader in medical research and part of a solution that would help people suffering in pain.”  New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria are scheduled to take part in the trials.  WA Health Minister Kim Hames said there was no point in all states doing the same sorts of trials at the same time. “WA is waiting on the results of the NSW trials as agreed last year,” he said. “If other states want to do their own trials, that’s fine.” “WA has offered out support to other states and we are keen to see the outcomes of the research being undertaken.”  Whatever the outcome Lily said she would continue to work hard in the classroom so she could become a doctor.  “So I can help people like me,” she said.

OVER the past few months, more and more NFL players have come out in favour of medical marijuana use, with everyone from Eugene Monroe to Derrick Morgan publicly discussing the benefits it could bring to players suffering from chronic pain. However, while those guys have quietly, calmly, rationally discussed cannabis’ benefits, another former NFL player spoke up on Wednesday. And he was anything but quiet. That would be Jake Plummer, who came out fired up when discussing marijuana, as well as the public perception of players who want to use it to deal with pain. Specifically he talked about the divide between the perception of players and ownership in public in an interview with BSN Denver. “I have a hard time with it because everybody says, ‘Oh, poor NFL millionaires. Oh, you poor people.’ They don’t understand,” Plummer said. “Maybe they should have a little more to say about the owners that are billionaires, they’re not millionaires; they’re billionaires.” “Like Jerry Jones, who says it’s ‘absurd’ that there would be a link between brain trauma, football and CTE,” Plummer adds. “Shame on him for saying that, that billionaire [expletive]. It’s the worst thing in the world for a guy like that to say. That’s where we’re sitting; grown-[expletive] men are asked to go out there for millions of dollars — which, yeah, it’s a lot of money — bang themselves around and completely [expletive] their lives over for their 40s and 50s. So yeah, poor football players is what I say. If you’re a grown-[expletive] man, you should be allowed to make grown-[expletive] decisions.” Specifically, Plummer reverenced how Josh Gordon has essentially been blackballed by the league after multiple positive tests. “Not get tested for it like Josh Gordon, who now can’t play the game that he’s been playing since he was a kid because he smokes marijuana. It didn’t derail him or cause him to underachieve from what I witnessed. He dominated the league for two straight years, and now he’s out of the league because he chose an alternative form of medicine.” While the tone of Plummer’s comments (specifically about owners) are what will get the headlines, in a larger, broader sense, Plummer’s point is well-taken. The simple truth is that NFL players deal with pain and injury on a scale unlike virtually anyone else, in any other profession. Therefore, in Plummer’s estimation they should be able to medicate how they want, and as he explained later in the interview, marijuana is a better alternative than prescription pain killers.  Whether you agree with Plummer or not, they are interesting points. And after so many people have tried to take make the argument on behalf of medical marijuana in a calm, rational way, maybe it will take Plummer’s loud, outspoken voice to get folks to pay attention.

DOCTORS have been given overwhelming support from Victorian parents to prescribe medical cannabis to treat children’s illnesses. More than 80 per cent of mums and 67 per cent of dads who did the Herald Sun Primary School Parents’ Survey want the ban overturned.  SURVEY RESULTS: Parents addicted to screen time SURVEY RESULTS: Families to turn to Dr Google to avoid GP co-payment SURVEY RESULTS: Date nights a rarity for Victorian parents The issue has been hotly debated since the Herald Sun revealed in January the case of Tara O’Connell, 9, who had been given months to live but made a miraculous recovery from severe epilepsy after her mother started giving her liquid cannabis. The Herald Sun also revealed this month “Dr Dope” Andrew Katelaris is supplying cannabis oil and tincture to 12 children around Australia from a secret laboratory, despite the threat of legal action.  He has been inundated with more requests since the revelations, but is only able to supply a limited number of patients. A Reservoir mum who completed the survey said: “It’s cruel to leave children in pain when a solution is known”.  However, a Gisborne mother said: “It is not researched and the oil cannot be precise due to the variations in each plant, and it still contains THC, which causes mental illness.” Clinical trials of medical cannabis are set to go ahead with both the State Government and Opposition committing support.  But, while Labor has committed to legalising medical cannabis for those suffering life-threatening conditions, the Coalition has not, meaning it may take years for sick patients to gain legal access.

Dr Bartone said limited trials worldwide had shown cannabis was an effective treatment for some forms of epilepsy and muscle spasticity among other conditions, but more robust trials were needed. “By the time it hits the doctor’s prescribing pen in the surgery, all parents should be assured that, used appropriately and under medical supervision, it’s as safe as any other medication on the market.” jennifer.kelly@news.com.au Originally published as Medical marijuana not such a dopey cure, say parents in our primary school survey To join the conversation, please

https://www.news.com.au/sponsored/qMHOX3LedCY1q076rqw5/australias-first-female-led-green-pharmacy/,Australia's first female-led ‘green pharmacy’,,"Lisa Nguyen saw a gap in the market for a ‘female-led’ medical cannabis dispensary in Australia. In less than two years, it’s big business. Lisa Nguyen, founder of Astrid news.com.au and Chartered Accountants ANZ have teamed up to celebrate extraordinary Chartered Accountants who are supporting businesses, organisations and communities through the tough times. Step inside Astrid in the upmarket suburb of South Yarra in Melbourne, and you might not know you're at one of Australia's first medical cannabis dispensaries.  Painted sage green with natural wood shelving and terrazzo countertops, the nondescript store could pass for an interior design firm, pilates studio or day spa. Staff wear fashionable athleisure with Nike Air Force Ones and greet their customers with a cheerfully casual, “G'day.”  Astrid is the vision of Lisa Nguyen, a trained clinical pharmacist with a background in medical science, who educates doctors and pharmacists about cannabinoid medicines. ""Working for a few different cannabis companies, I saw women did not lead many,"" she says. ""I saw a gap for a more feminine cannabis brand to help to facilitate that access a little bit better."" When medical cannabis was legalised in 2016, Ms Nguyen noticed patients struggled to fulfil their prescriptions at pharmacies, even though many doctors and pharmacists understood the efficacy of the treatment. ""Medicinal cannabis is still very taboo, even though it is being used as a therapeutic medicine,"" she says. ""I wanted to create a warm, boutique and beautiful space that aimed to remove the stigma.” Patients are usually on the final step in their cannabis journey when they enter Astrid. “It’s often is a plethora of emotions for patients to finally access legal cannabis for chronic pain, anxiety and sleep, so we wanted to create a ‘non-pharmacy pharmacy’ where they felt calm and safe. I wanted patients to feel comfortable and accepted in getting their medical cannabis prescription from someone who was non-judgemental and understood how the medication worked and what it's used for,"" Ms Nguyen says. Ms Nguyen launched Astrid at the beginning of 2021.  “While the entire world was freaking out about Covid, I was hustling in the background. I was trying to navigate a way to bootstrap my business, when the banks wouldn’t give me a loan. I learnt how to do shop fit out with little funds, create a business plan from scratch, and focused on a brand strategy so I could get this business off the ground,"" she says. When the store fit-out was complete, she and her first employee, Judy, opened up the business to those grim months of lockdowns and empty streets. It was devastating. ""It was just us, and we were just trying to make it work,"" she recalls. ""Like, day one, we opened and we're like, 'How do we get a customer in here? How do we get patients? How do we create a unique experience? Can we pay the rent this month?' The first three months were rough."" Astrid in South Yarra in Melbourne is one of Australia's first medical cannabis dispensaries A friend introduced her to Chris Pham, a Chartered Accountant and managing director of Mission Grow, a business advisory firm interested in supporting young founders to scale their start-ups.  Seeing the opportunity in the business and understanding Ms Nguyen's vision, Mission Grow offered advisory support. ""When I first got introduced to Lisa, she was in a bit of trouble financially,"" Mr Pham says. ""She knew about medical cannabis and was great at branding, but she didn't know much about business. So she had a lot of drive but no direction."" Mission Grow helped steer the business in the right direction by setting up basic operations like a POS system, inventory management and payroll. Beyond operations, they devised a pricing model, sales strategy, and business plan and connected Ms Nguyen to a professional network. ""An accountant is someone who does the numbers and who inputs data,"" Mr Pham says, ""But a Chartered Accountant is like an architect or the engineer and they help design the processes to help you build a better business based on the numbers."" To navigate the disruption of lockdowns, Ms Nguyen learnt to pivot Astrid quickly by setting up telehealth and operating online. Once the streets were bustling again, the next milestone was employing more staff members to scale the business. Chris Pham CA from Mission Grow (left). ""She [Lisa] knew about medical cannabis and was great at branding, but she didn't know much about business."" ""Most businesses, when they first start, are hesitant to hire because it costs them a lot of money. They believe that if they can do it, why pay someone else? We taught Lisa how to let that go and hire people so that it could free her time to do what she should be doing,"" Mr Pham says.  Today, Ms Nguyen employs 20 people, and Astrid is growing exponentially month on month. ""Chris was like, 'Lisa, you can't manage 20 people anymore. You need to make departments, you need to make teams, and then you need to have those team members report to you…,"" says Ms Nguyen with a laugh. ""Learning that within a year and a half is crazy. It took a lot of grit and learning from our mistakes. But now we're at a special stage of growth where we know our purpose, our culture, and a model that works, and now we're asking, 'How do we maintain a people-focused culture whilst we are hyper growing?'” Still, Ms Nguyen has ""loved every second"" of her start-up journey. ""I think one of my biggest learnings was trying to figure out what kind of leader I want to be for my team and what kind of impact I want to have on patients and this industry,"" she says. ""I want to be a compassionate leader, lead by example and make sure the team can create their own legacy.” Mr Pham offers a sounding board for the business challenges she encounters as she develops her leadership style.  “Having Chris there creates that real structure and backbone for me whenever I have a problem. In an emerging industry like cannabis – there are a lot of problems. It is a different perspective from Chris because he works with many different start-ups. He often reassures me that many of my problems are quite normal, and has taught me how to pivot at each curve ball."" Lisa Nguyen says ""we wanted to create a ‘non-pharmacy pharmacy’ Today, Mission Grow consults on a monthly basis to ensure the business maintains its momentum. ""Every month, we go through the six key areas: sales, branding, people, operations, process, procedures and financial. We go through that in depth, and we give her strategic direction to implement in the next month, and we have a plan for the next year,"" Mr Pham says. Beyond the day-to-day operations, Mission Grow supports Ms Nguyen in achieving her long-term goals. ""I would really love Astrid to be an industry leader in the medical cannabis dispensary space. To do this, I want to create a unique patient experience when they come into the store, or whether they talk to us online,” she says. “Hopefully, I'll have little Astrids in every state around Australia.""

MOMENTUM is growing for a state-based trial of medicinal cannabis as more Tasmanians come forward with success ­stories involving cannabis-based treatments. Kingston mum Nicole Cowles says a cannabinoid tincture has all but eliminated the seizures that have plagued daughter Alice since infancy.  Alice, 8, has the rare genetic condition CDKL5 and can suffer up to 30 seizures a day. “There’s nothing more heartbreaking or soul destroying than seeing your child suffering or possibly dying. She could die from any seizure she has,” Ms Cowles said. She said after a number of medicines were prescribed, some with significant side-­effects, she “searched the world” for an alternative. She sourced the cannabinoid tincture from NSW company Mullaways Medical Cannabis, which provides the liquid drops to her free-of-charge. She said within weeks of Alice taking the drops orally twice a day, life had changed dramatically. Alice can enjoy swimming, playing outside, going to school and activities other children take for granted.  Ms Cowles supports a trial in the interests of developing a safe, regulated supply for ­people who could benefit from cannabis-based medicines. “There are at least 80 kids Australia-wide that are on the medicine for seizures,” she said. A petition has also been launched urging the State Government to reconsider its position against holding a trial. Health Minister Michael Ferguson has ruled out holding a trial because he has “real concerns about security, safety and the potential for social harm”. However, the Legislative Council has launched an ­inquiry into the issue and the State Opposition is backing the petition asking the Government to allow a trial. The petition has been ­started by North-West cancer patient Natalie Daley. Shadow Attorney-General Lara Giddings said people in Ms Daley or Ms Cowles’ situation should not have to break the law to obtain medicine for either themselves or their children. “Health Minister Michael Ferguson is standing in the way of public opinion on this issue,” Ms Giddings said.  “Hopefully the Legislative Council inquiry will further ­inform the debate and influence the Liberal Government’s rigid opinion. “In the meantime, I’ll stand with those Tasmanians advocating for a change in policy. “Medicinal cannabis pre­sents significant health and economic benefits for ­Tasmania.” Originally published as Pressure grows for approval on cannabis treatments To join the conversation, please

Fans say “we need to have compassion”. A GREENS MLA has proposed a bold new plan to make Canberra the medical marijuana capital of Australia.  The legislative assembly is currently holding an inquiry into a bill containing a medical marijuana scheme proposed by minister Shane Rattenbury which is due to be ruled on by June 2015.  In the latest move by the minister, he has outlined a plan that would allow the ACT to develop a monopolised cannabis industry akin to Tasmania’s $120 million dollar poppy industry.  Mr. Rattenbury would like to see the ACT government granted an immediate exemption from the federal ban on importing the plant and is calling on the inquiry to allow Canberra businesses to begin developing a medical marijuana industry.  The ACT Greens balance-of-power member wants regulation allowing businesses to grow cannabis for medical and scientific purposes, spruiking the economic benefits of such a scheme.  “The ACT Government should explore the benefits that these businesses could bring to our jurisdiction, as well as the safeguards and conditions that would be necessary to ensure they operate safely and appropriately.” Mr. Rattenbury told the inquiry.  The issue of medical cannabis has been an ongoing debate in Australia but those championing its benefits have long been met with insurmountable inertia.  The CEO of the Public Health Association of Australia, Michael Moore, believes “now is the time” for the passage of such legislation. The PHAA supports the Minister’s plan and believes the current legal framework is “out of step with the attitudes and behaviour of much of the general public and professional opinion.” When it comes to allowing those with terminal illness to use medicinal marijuana, Mr. Moore says he “cannot see any reason not to [allow it] ... we need to have compassion,” he told news.com.au.  But despite a growing body of research and multiple US states adopting medical marijuana, there remains trepidation from some in the Australian medical community. The Australian Medical Association chief executive Christine Brill told the The Canberra Times the ACT’s branch of the organisation did not support the plan. Ms Brill stressed the need for greater research and said smoking crude cannabis “poses unacceptable health risks.” Meanwhile, health minister Simon Corbell has also expressed concerns over the legalisation of medicinal marijuana.  However Mr. Rattenbury believes there has been sufficient time to debate the issue and wants legislation enacted immediately.  “There is a clear urgency for progress on this issue and the political debate is unfortunately taking longer than people should have to wait; we need to legislate now.” Mr. Rattenbury said last month when encouraging the public to make a submissions to the inquiry.  Michael Moore agrees saying “this needs to be something we’re working towards.” Those opposed the proposed bill point to the potential for abuse of medicinal marijuana and the concern that it will lead to the eventual legalisation of recreational use. Given that the plant is decriminalised in the ACT (with punishment for a small plant akin to a speeding fine), Mr. Moore says it’s unlikely that people will start rushing out to their doctors in order to acquire the substance.  The push from the Green’s minister comes after the NSW government announced it will fund three medical marijuana trials involving children with severe epilepsy, adults with terminal illness and people with nausea induced by chemotherapy. The trials, announced at the end of last year, will cost $9 million with NSW premier Mike Baird saying at the time “it’s about trying to make a difference to individuals, their families and friends in incredibly difficult circumstances.” Mr. Rattenbury sees his proposal as getting in on the ground floor of what could soon be a thriving medical sector.  If the legislation comes to pass, he hopes there will be business operating in Canberra that will supply the upcoming trials. With 69 per cent of Australians supporting medical marijuana, if Shane Rattenbury has his way, Canberra could well become the cannabis capital of Australia.  The Liberal Party has made a call on Anthony Albanese’s Indigenous Voice referendum after a lengthy party room meeting in Canberra. After widespread reports Anthony Albanese had been invited “in principle” to Beijing, the Prime Minister has finally weighed in. Peter Dutton and the Liberals have finally revealed whether they will support the Indigenous Voice to parliament referendum. Our Apps",13,734

The managing director of AusCann — a business partner of Tasmanian Alkaloids, which gained a licence in July to grow cannabis to produce pain-­relieving drugs — says those wanting the drug should go through the proper channels.  Interest in the ethical production of medicinal cannabis and cannabis technology was evident at the recent Earth Expo in Launceston. But AusCann’s Elaine Darby said it could be dangerous to take ­unregulated medicinal cannabis sourced from the ­internet or a “street corner”.  “At best, the products are ineffective in terms of what they are claiming to treat. At worst, they are highly toxic and dangerous to the person’s health,” Ms Darby said.  Since September it has been legal for Tasmanians wanting to access medicinal cannabis to obtain it through a prescription from a medical specialist.  So far no prescriptions have been written. GPs are required to refer patients to a specialist, who then applies to the secretary of the Health Department for a decision. A Tasmanian Health Service spokesman said the first three applications received under the state’s medical cannabis access scheme were being assessed.  AMA Tasmania president Stuart Day said there was limited evidence of the benefit of medicinal cannabis and most patients that had requested access so far did not have conditions that would be helped by a ­prescription.  “The current available preparations are uncontrolled and variable, unlike approved medications, and they are also ­expensive and not subsidised by the PBS,” Dr Day said.  “As such, the only affordable way patients can access this product is via public hospital pharmacies. The AMA supports the process in place to allow patients access to this product where there is some evidence medicinal cannabis might offer additional benefit to current treatment.”  Ms Darby said there were up to 104 different cannabinoids that had different effects depending on the condition being treated. She encouraged those wanting to access the medication to find the right GP. “If a doctor is not willing to discuss medicinal cannabis with you, seek one who is open to finding out about cannabinoid medicines or has educated themselves on whether these medicines may be suitable for your medical condition,” she said.  Ms Darby said only medi­cines supplied by a pharmacy on prescription from a doctor met the Therapeutic Goods Administration’s high quality and efficacy standards.  She said there were strict international guidelines to ensure the medications contained exactly what was on the label.  To join the conversation, please

CLINICAL trials of cannabis for medicinal purposes won’t see it approved for prescription and should not delay a law change allowing the use of the drug, an expert says. The former Dean of University of Melbourne’s medical school Professor David Penington says the varying potency of cannabis means it will never be marketed as a pharmaceutical. “Cannabis can never be a pharmaceutical agent in the usual sense for medical prescription, as it contains a variety of components of variable potency and actions, depending on its origin, preparation and route of administration,” he says in the latest issue of the Medical Journal Australia published Monday. Three states are currently examining making cannabis available for medicinal purposes and the federal Senate is set to debate a private member’s bill to set up a regulator to oversee the production and distribution of the drug. The NSW government is spending $9 million on three trials examining the use of medicinal cannabis for children with severe, drug-resistant Epilepsy, adults with a terminal illness suffering pain, nausea and vomiting and those with chemotherapy-induced nausea. ACCEPTED: PM has no problem with medicinal cannabis But Professor Penington says a double-blind clinical trial of cannabis is not possible because people would easily become aware whether they were receiving the drug or a placebo, he said. “The clinical trial proposed, if successful, presumes that cannabis would then be approved and regulated as a pharmaceutical substance,” Professor Penington writes. “Cannabis has variable effects on individuals. It will not be possible to determine universally safe dosage of cannabis for individuals based on a clinical trial.” The use of cannabis should be decided by the patient, following medical advice about the condition from which they seek relief, those using it would have to register for it and purchase it from a registered supplier, he said. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews made an election pledge to legalise cannabis oil and tablets for medicinal use by the end of 2015. And a Tasmanian parliamentary committee is examining the issue in that state.  Professor Penington is urging a faster go ahead of medicinal cannabis claiming Australia is “behind the times”. In the US 23 states have legalised use of cannabis for medical conditions, as have Israel, Holland and the Czech Republic, he says. Clinical trials of the drug won’t be useful because they won’t be able to determine a universally safe dosage. “Response to cannabis varies from person to person partly due to genetic variation among users, he said. The drug has two active elements THC and CBD. THC produces a powerful euphoria but also hallucinations and psychotic effects. CBD does not give a high but can suppress nausea and pain, he says. There is some evidence cannabis can accelerate the development of schizophrenia and that it is linked to social, behavioural and mental problems when used frequently by people aged 15 to 25. The POINT study of people suffering from chronic problems such as back pain, migraine and arthritis recently found 16 per cent of patients had turned to cannabis to relieve their symptoms even though they’d been prescribed opioids like morphine and oxycodone. Perth-based company Phytotech plans to work with farmers in the US and Uruguay to grow indoor and outdoor marijuana crops for medicinal purposes. It listed on the Australian sharemarket this month. It estimates the global cannabis industry is worth up to $US100 billion ($128 billion). To join the conversation, please

Do you agree that medicinal cannabis should be legalised? OPPOSITION Leader Mark McGowan yesterday revealed how meeting a dying young man in a Rockingham nursing home changed his position on medicinal cannabis. He and the WA Labor Party now support legalising cannabis for medicinal purposes and PerthNow today asks you what your view is on this contentious issue.  ●  HOW MARTIN CHANGED MY MIND In a column written for The Sunday Times and PerthNow yesterday , Mr McGowan said chronically and terminally ill people “need compassion, not punishment”. He has opened up about meeting Martin, who died about four years ago. His only relief from a terminal illness was the odd cannabis joint that nursing home staff “turned a blind eye to”. “Even simple acts like getting moved out of bed and sitting in a chair hurt. He felt isolated and out of place, too, as the only young person in a nursing home designed for elderly people,” he said. “The highlight of his day was at nights when he smoked cannabis in a quiet courtyard to ease his pain. Everyone in the nursing home turned a blind eye to it. So did I. We knew it gave him some relief.” Mr McGowan announced WA Labor’s plan to legalise cannabis for medicinal purposes at the party’s state conference last month.  It came days after Tasmania’s Legislative Council announced it would hold an inquiry into the medicinal use of cannabis. “We need to change Western Australia’s laws so that doctors can prescribe medicinal cannabis under the supervision of a medical practitioner,” Mr McGowan wrote. “It would be dispensed like other medications as a tablet or spray. “This is not advocating the legalisation of recreational cannabis but we need to find a way to allow the medicinal use of cannabis to help the nausea, vomiting, lack of appetite and pain in chronically and terminally ill people.” Originally published as Poll: Do you support Mark McGowan and Labor’s stance that medicinal cannabis should be legalised?

COMEDIAN Wil Anderson has called for the legalisation of medical marijuana and opened up about his seven-year battle with debilitating osteoarthritis. Now pursuing a career in the US, the Los Angeles-based comic uses medical marijuana to cope with chronic back and hip pain. Cannabis is legal for medical use in California. The 40-year-old Gruen Transfer host began using the drug regularly after experiencing “massive, serious side effects” with “pretty hardcore” conventional prescription medications. ONLY OPTION: Medical marijuana used to treat little girl’s seizures CONTROVERSIAL: Baird backs medical marijuana News_Image_File: Health battle ... Wil Anderson smokes marijuana daily to cope with chronic back and hip pain. “For me the only thing that truly treats it in a day-to-day way, that I can live my life and go on with it, has been medical marijuana,” he said, “The fact that in one country I can get a legal medicine that treats my pain but when I go back to my own country I either have to go without that medicine or be a criminal...Certainly for me and my situation it would be a lot easier if there was medical marijuana.”News_Image_File: In pain ... Wil Anderson says medical marijunana is the only thing that helps treat his condition.  Anderson’s osteoarthritis is so severe he’s sometimes literally unable to move. He’s been advised by doctors to delay surgery — a double hip replacement — until the technology and failure rates improve. “There has not been one moment in seven years when I have been completely without pain,” he revealed. “Sometimes that pain is so debilitating that I can’t walk, I can’t get out of bed.” Anderson created a stir in June when he was filmed smoking marijuana on the online US show Getting Doug With High. But he laughed off the controversy, saying the public was broadly supportive. “I don’t think anyone gives a s--t about that,” he said. “Comedian smokes pot? That’s your headline?”News_Image_File: TV comic ... Wil Anderson with Gruen panellists Russel Howcroft and Todd Sampson. Outside of medical use, Anderson acknowledged the drug has “genuine side effects” particularly for young people and those predisposed to schizophrenia. He said he’d also seen comedian friends “be stoners and blow their careers, so there are a lot of downsides as well.” But he said Australia has the “highest per capita use of marijuana in the world” so the current laws clearly aren’t working. According to research published in The Lancet in 2012 cannabis use in Australia is three times the global average. “Alcohol obviously does a lot more damage to society than marijuana does,” he said. “So there is part of me that thinks wouldn’t it be better if it was regulated and we could warn people and we could sell it and not make people criminals for chosing a drug? “I’m a person who believes in the principle … that I’m an adult and as long as what I’m doing isn’t hurting anyone else, then I’m not sure what, of anyone else’s business it is.” Anderson made the comments in an interview with Switched On to promote Seven’s upcoming comedy special Montreal — Just For Laughs 2014.

LEGALISING medical marijuana could save many of the hundreds of lives lost each year to prescription drug and ­heroin overdoses. A study in the US — where, like Australia, prescription drug deaths have been rising for a decade — has found the opposite trend in 13 states where medical marijuana use has been legalised. Prescription drug overdose deaths in those states dropped by a quarter, the study published this week on the American Medical Association’s online journal found. Drug sector workers in Victoria said making marijuana available for chronic pain relief would reduce the use of more dangerous drugs, including opiod-based prescription painkillers such as oxycodone and illegal drugs including heroin. In 2012, 209 Victorian deaths were ­attributed to prescription opioid overdoses and 109 to heroin overdoses. The State Government this week announced it would allow clinical trials of medical cannabis but stopped short of legalising its use. Victoria’s peak medical body said medical cannabis may prove more effective than current prescribed treatments in some cases but legalising it would not solve prescription drug overdose problems. “The abuse of prescription drugs needs a comprehensive response that include a real-time prescription monitoring system and increased education about the dangers of certain prescription medications,” AMA Victoria president Dr Tony Bartone said. “However, the legalisation of medicinal cannabis for specific conditions, following extensive clinical trials proving its efficacy, could provide ­patients with further options.” peter.mickelburough@news.com.au Originally published as Overdose deaths fall by a quarter in US states where medical marijuana is legal, study shows To join the conversation, please

SUNSHINE Coast mum Katrina Spraggon is so desperate to get her daughter Kaitlyn the cannabis oil that stops the nine-year-old’s crippling seizures that she has started making the illegal drug herself.  Ms Spraggon said she had tried everything to get Queensland Health to prescribe the drug but instead she had been told Lady Cilento Hospital would no longer treat her daughter if she continued using it and police searched her house the day Kaitlyn returned from treatment.   She said Queensland Health also refused to renew her daughter’s supply of bottled oxygen — which runs out this month and she’ll die without — in the latest episode of her three-year fight with the government.  A last-minute meeting with Health Minister Cameron Dick on Friday afternoon after One Nation MP Steve Dickson raised her case in Parliament secured Kaitlyn the bottled oxygen but her mother said she could not take her daughter off the illegal drug for fear she would have more seizures, which require CPR and oxygen to keep her alive.  The Ningi single mum said her daughter relied on the THC in raw cannabis oil to ease chronic pain from spinal and hip problems. Without it, the pain triggered severe seizures. She said that Kaitlyn had been prescribed a cocktail of strong opioids and other prescription drugs to deal with her 19 medical conditions but they left her heavily sedated.  Since using cannabis her daughter had been alert and had been interacting with siblings and ready to return to school, Ms Spraggon said. She told Queensland Health doctors and the police and put details on Facebook and said it was the only way to stop her daughter’s seizures.  She said she desperately wanted a cannabis oil with THC prescription for her daughter so she could stop making the drug but had been stonewalled.  “The cannabis oil I’m using, it’s illegal,” Ms Spraggon told The Sunday Mail. “I’ve been open and honest since three years that I’ve put my daughter on it. I haven’t hidden a thing.” She said she had repeatedly tried to have a meeting with Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, who had posed with her daughter at Christmas parties but not scheduled a meeting.  A spokesman for Mr Dick said doctors could prescribe raw cannabis if they believed it would benefit patients but Ms Spraggon was told it was illegal to use cannabis in Queensland outside that framework.  “To date, there have been 20 applications from medical practitioners across Queensland to prescribe medicinal cannabis,” he said. But he said privacy laws stopped Queensland Health from naming those doctors. “Ms Spraggon was advised that under Queensland’s new legal framework an application for medicinal cannabis could be made by Kaitlyn’s paediatric specialist if the specialist considered it could provide a clinical benefit,” he said.

OPINION:   AUSTRALIA proved it was open-minded when it came to saying yes to same-sex marriage.  The Yes vote has reason to celebrate, but if we truly are a progressive county like many of you proclaimed on social media, why are we not discussing other outdated practices like the fact weed is still illegal for recreational use in Australia in 2017? Even though I don’t care for the institution of marriage as a whole, I still voted Yes because I believe, as adults, we should be given the freedom to make our own choices for things that really don’t have a negative impact on the lives of others. And I think weed is one choice.   ‘WHAT ARE THE LAWS CURRENTLY IN AUSTRALIA?’ Our country is slowly taking steps to change its stance on weed, with Victoria becoming the first state to legalise marijuana for young children suffering from epilepsy, while NSW also allows use for patients suffering from serious illnesses such as cancer or multiple sclerosis.  Queensland’s laws are the most flexible in the country, which grant patients of any age or suffering from a range of illnesses access to medicinal cannabis products.   Tasmania allows medical cannabis in limited circumstances where conventional treatment has been unsuccessful, as does Western Australia, South Australia, the NT and the ACT. While the use of medical marijuana is a step in the right direction, we also need to be talking about legalising it for recreational use, which would bring us on par with a number of countries across the world.  As of January 1, 2018, weed will be recreationally legal in a number of US states including Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington DC.  This will bring America in line with Austria, Bangladesh, Belgium, Belize, Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Greece, parts of India, Italy, Jamaica, Luzembourg, Malta, Mexico, Myanmar, Netherlands, Norway, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Russia, Solvenia, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine and Uruguay — all of which have made recreational weed use legal or decriminalised.   ‘WHAT ABOUT THE NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS?’ Pot is still largely considered to have detrimental results on mental and physical health, but how much of this view is based on fact and how much is derived from weed-fearing propaganda from days gone by? Earlier this year, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine completed the world’s most comprehensive study into marijuana to try and find an answer.  After examining more than 10,000 scientific abstracts dating back to 1999, the extensive 395-page report unearthed more than 100 conclusions about the health effects of recreational and therapeutic cannabis use — many of which support arguments it should be legal.  “The evidence suggests that smoking cannabis does not increase the risk for certain cancers (i.e., lung, head, and neck) in adults,” one of the findings read. And while it did admit smoking cannabis on a regular basis is associated with chronic cough and phlegm production, it explained the drug orally will likely reduce these symptoms — legalisation of weed means you can buy eatables and not be forced to smoke.  The report also confirmed the many therapeutic effects of weed.  “In adults with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, oral cannabinoids are effective antiemetics,” the report read. “In adults with chronic pain, patients who were treated with cannabis or cannabinoids are more likely to experience a clinically significant reduction in pain symptoms. “In adults with multiple sclerosis (MS)-related spasticity, short-term use of oral cannabinoids improves patient reported spasticity symptoms.” When looking at cannabis use and mental health, the findings offer mixed results. “Cannabis use is likely to increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychoses; the higher the use the greater the risk,” the report read. However, it added that a history of cannabis individuals with schizophrenia and other psychoses may be “linked to better performance on learning and memory tasks”. The research found smoking weed did not appear to increase the likelihood of developing depression, anxiety or PTSD, with heavy cannabis smokers even more likely to report thoughts of suicide than non-users.  ‘IT CAN’T BE LEGAL, WEED MAKES YOU LAZY’ I can already hear the naysayers claiming marijuana is a dangerous drug that will ruin your life or turn you into a lazy stoner who spends their time watching movies and waiting on their couch for Uber Eats to be delivered.  While this is a likely a highly enjoyable way to spend your time, the stereotype is largely outdated and inaccurate for modern-day users of the drug.  I agree there might be people in society that do fit the aforementioned cliche, but you could argue those people likely lack drive regardless of whether they smoke pot or not.  Recent times have actually shown a huge surge in people smoking weed to help athletic performance as it deepens concentration, increases tissue oxygenation, and decreases muscle spasms before, during and after exercise.  Ultra-endurance athlete Avery Collins, who runs 240km per week, said training stoned helps him achieve flow quicker as the “runner’s high” acts upon the same receptors that receive the THC in marijuana. “I use it as a way to intensify and enhance the run. It makes the longevity of the runner’s high last longer because technically you’re already high,” he told Motherboard.  With cannabis also long been accredited with anti-inflammatory properties, Mr Collins said he also smokes weed for the pain relief after gruelling training sessions.  “I’d be lying if I said [cannabis] doesn’t help soothe my muscles,” he added. It’s not just runners who benefit either, with UFC commentator/stand-up comedian/podcaster Joe Rogan talking about its benefits for fighters. “I think it (marijuana) is a performance-enhancing drug. If it wasn’t, a huge majority of jiu-jitsu guys wouldn’t be using it before they train,” he said on The MMA Hour. “They don’t do it because it hurts them; they do it because it helps them.” He also claimed to have seen the benefits first-hand. “I like to smoke pot and work out,” he said. “Getting high and working out is one of the least talked about and least appreciated pleasures of fitness.”  Do you think weed should be legal?

AN Australian company will grow medicinal cannabis on Christmas Island.  AusCann will begin planting trial crops of marijuana on the detention centre island ahead of its planned listing on the Australian Securities Exchange in early 2016.  Cannabis remains an illegal substance in Australia, but the federal government has flagged introducing a bill next year to legalise growing the plants for their medicinal uses.  Auscann said that it was in the final stages of planning the trial planting which will include five varieties of cannabinoids sourced from leading Spanish company Phytoplant Research with which it has an exclusive partnership.  If the trial is successful, and federal laws are changed, Auscann will begin planting the first commercial crop for the domestic market in late 2016, managing director Dr Elaine Darby said.  “We have carefully selected Christmas Island for its isolation, climate and security,” she said in a statement.  “In particular, we note that the amount of available daylight hours is critical to triggering cannabis plant flowering. Christmas Island experiences minimal changes to its daylight hours, so it is feasible that we could produce two crops each year.” Ms Darby said the company had also already begun to reach out to the 2000 locals on Christmas Island and was expecting their full support.  “If our commercial plans proceed as expected, we will create local employment and provide a vital boost to the local economy,” she said.  Auscann was established in 2014 and aims to produce homegrown medicinal cannabis for export to other countries and for the domestic market once proposed legislation passes.  Last week, federal Health Minister Sussan Ley said the government would introduce a national scheme for the controlled cultivation of medicinal cannabis into parliament next year. NSW is also expected to run the country’s first trial of cannabis-based drugs treatment for children with epilepsy next year.  Christmas Island is located 2,600 kilometres northwest of Perth and also houses one of Australia’s largest detention centres for asylum seekers.  Auscann’s plans for the island and its upcoming ASX listing come after it successfully tapped investors for $3 million.

But the man they call the Pot Doctor is prepared to go to prison for what he’s doing. “IT’S bizarre that in the 21st Century we have to hide the production of life saving medicine,” says Dr Andrew Katelaris as he opens the panel to his secret makeshift laboratory hidden inside a bedroom wardrobe. For more than a decade Dr Katelaris has been brewing his therapeutic cannabis oil in the shadows, away from the watchful eyes of the main medical establishment who have shunned his zealot-like approach to medical marijuana.  Dr Katelaris was struck off the medical register in 2005 for conducting research into the drug. He has been arrested dozens of times and charged for a range of drug offences. Since then he has aggressively pursued his belief that cannabis can be used to treat illnesses and has focused on producing an oil that alleviates the symptoms of childhood epilepsy. And he has done it knowing he could be arrested again. It might seem extreme, but for the man making medical marijuana for kids, he says the risk is worth it. “I haven’t sought to avoid legal troubles,” Dr Katelaris says in a new documentary called The Pot Doctor. “Our primary motivation is to actually advance the cause of medical cannabis.  “Over the last few years even though I have operated quite openly I haven’t attracted any negative legal intervention which is appreciated but we’re prepared to fight on any front that’s presented and if its necessary that we go to court and dispute the prohibition against medical cannabis and that’s what we will do.” Dr Katelaris says he believes so strongly in the medical benefits of cannabis that he didn’t have a problem giving up his medical license. He claims he was told to choose between his research and being a registered doctor. “It wasn’t a very hard decision,” he explained. “Seeing the therapeutic affects of what we were doing and the clear superiority of cannabis therapeutics whether they are used a sole agent or a combination agent.  “Once you have seen that you can’t turn your back on people and say ‘yeah there’s something that will help you a great deal but you can’t have it. That’s simply not acceptable for me. “People say of you have sacrificed a lot, your career, but this is my career, right? If I was one of the yes men in a white coat, that’s not a career. That’s the role of a yes man in a white coat. It simply didn’t suit my personality. But I have not sacrificed my career, this is my career.”  Last month, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee unanimously passed the Regulator of Medicinal Cannabis Bill which supporters say is the first steps towards regulating medical cannabis. It is this approach that the Australian Medical Association supports, one that sees checks and balances installed. However the time it will take authorities to conduct and complete trials will not come soon enough. Melbourne parents Cassie Batten and Rhett Wallace have been using cannabis oil with their four-year-old son Cooper who has severe brain damage, cerebral abscesses, hydrocephalus, epilepsy and cerebral palsy. He used to suffer daily seizures and would be have to be hospitalised but since he began taking the oil, the seizures have stopped. Not only that but they say his quality of life has improved dramatically. “Walking doesn’t seem out of the question now,” dad Rhett says in the documentary. The cannabis oil that is used in the medication is derived from a specific type of marijuana plant that is rich in the medically useful cannabinoid CBD but low in THC, the part of the plant that gets you stoned. It is prepared in oil or tincture, which has a mild flavour and is easy for children to ingest. “Since we have discovered the amazing therapeutic effects of CBD in childhood epilepsy, it is becoming imperative that our work not be disturbed because there is nothing worse than actually helping a child to achieve wellness and then by lack of product not being able to continue with that wellness,” he says in the documentary. “So therefore we are forced into hidden places to avoid the ignorant and draconian policies that are currently limiting access to medical cannabis for sick and dying children.” But not everyone shares his views. While the medical establishment are interested in exploring the uses of medicinal marijuana, they prefer it be tested and tried under strict guidelines before being given to the masses. “I suppose our bottom line is this, we would like evidence to make the assertion rather than one person who has spent ten or more years on almost a single issue,” Australian Medical Association vice president Dr Stephen Parnis told news.com.au, referring to Dr Katelaris. “I am concerned by his approach where it is a bit holier than though. He seems to feel that he knows more than the scientific community.  “I am concerned that the potential downside of any of the cannabinoids is not factored in. Any therapeutic substance, any drug can have potential benefits and potential risks. Cannabinoids are no different. And what we have said is that these things need to be considered like any other therapeutic substance.” Dr Parnis said he believed medical cannabis could be used to treat nausea and stimulate appetite in cancer patients and for the treatment of epilepsy.  “But it can’t be done by growing something in someone’s backyard, it needs tight control, it needs the right type of plant to be used because there’s more than one chemical — there are literally thousands of them. “And in terms of the evidence, it certainly points to optimism. These things can and should be used but as I said before, if we get this wrong and someone suffers an avoidable adverse outcome no one will thank us for it.” A search is currently underway in a state’s high country, where an Irish hiker has reportedly been missing for days.

THE State Government has signalled it could step back from its ban on a medicinal cannabis trial under pressure to grow the hemp industry in Tasmania. Treasurer and Local Government Minister Peter Gutwein has told councils pushing for the trial that the Government will seriously consider the recommendations of an Upper House committee. “We’re supporting that process and obviously we’ll be guided by the response that comes out of that process,” Mr Gutwein told the Local Government Association state conference in Hobart. “Are we prepared to look at and support the committee process and then look at the outcome? Absolutely, yes.” Mr Gutwein’s comments were in response to a question from Legislative Councillor and Latrobe Mayor Mike Gaffney. Several councils were dis­appointed by Health Minister Michael Ferguson’s decision earlier this month to disallow a trial proposed by Tasman Health Cannabinoids. Huon Valley council says a trial could create 40 jobs in the region. The 13-strong Regional Councils Group has thrown its support behind the industry as a possible antidote to the downturn in forestry. “We shouldn’t shut the door to anything,” spokesman Barry Jarvis said. “Too much in the past we’ve had groups that say no to things. “Let’s investigate it and get the data, and have a logical conversation.” Mr Jarvis said his group would be watching the recommendation of the Legis­lative Council committee. “If there’s value for our communities in it, we will lobby hard for the State Government to implement those changes,” he said. The debate was reignited as NSW’s Liberal Premier, Mike Baird, ­reportedly backed a trial of medicinal cannabis in his state. “The intransigence of Will Hodgman and his minister in blocking the proposed Tas­manian medical cannabis trial is holding Tasmania back when we could, and should, be leading the nation,” Greens MP Cassy O’Connor said. Councillors also expressed concerns about red tape constraining the growth of the ­industrial hemp industry. However, Mr Gutwein said the Government fully sup­ported the production of ­industrial hemp. “We’re looking at the red tape and regulation that surrounds that to ensure that an appropriate level of necessary regulation exists, not an ­unnecessary one,” Mr Gutwein said.

A BRITISH pharmaceutical company was working today to develop a new breed of cannabis-based products aimed at treating a range of conditions including diabetes, epilepsy and Crohn's disease. GW Pharmaceuticals, which launched a cannabis-derived medicine for symptoms of multiple sclerosis last year, has cross-bred different types of the plant to produce a new strain that could treat a wide range of disorders. The new varieties contain enhanced levels of therapeutic compounds, including an appetite suppressant cannabinoid called THCV, which the company hopes will be used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, obesity and other metabolic disorders. Research leader Dr. David Potter said, ""We've demonstrated that there are something like 60 cannabinoids in the cannabis plant, and so far we've looked in detail only at 12 to 15. You could say we've only scratched the surface so far."" Human safety trials are already underway on some of the new varieties, and the company hopes that by combining THCV with other cannabinoids they will be able to treat inflammatory diseases and epilepsy.
