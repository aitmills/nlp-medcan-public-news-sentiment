You might have seen her movies, you might have watched her on your small screen. You might not have known that Whoopi Goldberg, along with her business partner Maya Elisabeth, has launched her own line of cannabis medical products. These ones exist to specifically treat period pain among women. Of course, none of them are designed to provide a mental high, but a body high as a means of contributing to pain relief. Experiencing severe period pain herself, Goldberg told Vanity Fair in March this year that PMS is so heavily entrenched in her family, it was a natural cause for her to want to address. “I have grown granddaughters who have severe cramps, so I said this is what I want to work on,” she said at the time. She’s also not alone in her pursuit of period pain relief through the use of cannabis. Just this week, Psychiatrist Dr. Julie Holland spoke to Goop about how cannabis can be specifically effective in treating hormonal and emotional issues that are common among women, particularly around their periods. Do you avoid using the ‘period’ word? Post continues after video. So where does that leave us in Australia? Is it possible, after all, that medicinal cannabis could reach our own shores to specifically target the kinds of pain reserved for the most dreaded, bed-ridden kinds of periods? Perhaps. Dr. Nial Wheate, an Australian pharmaceutical chemist at the University of Sydney, is cautiously optimistic about the potential for medicinal cannabis to be used for women across the country side-lined by troublesome periods. The shortest answer Dr. Wheate can give us is that it’s likely medicinal cannabis will be effective in treating period pain. However, despite its use in the Unites States, statements claiming it is wholly, 100 per cent effective aren’t supported in Australia by a heap of evidence or studies to prove one way or another. “At the moment, there is no medical evidence, because no-one has done any studies, to uncover how well cannabis can treat period pain and cramps,” Dr. Wheate explains. “I think it’s likely that it would be useful because we know it’s very good for chronic pain and we do know it’s useful for muscle cramps. It’s likely to be useful, but there’s no evidence to support it as of yet.” No, you can’t. You might have read only a few weeks ago that medicinal cannabis was finally made legal in Australia after years of debate and a massive push from health professionals strident in their belief it can be a saviour for those experiencing chronic pain. But there's still one hurdle blocking the widespread use of medicinal cannabis in Australia. ""At the moment, any doctor in Australia can prescribe medicinal cannabis, although no-one is currently allowed to provide it,"" Dr. Wheate explains. ""The only limitation right now is that no-one is allowed to import it or produce it in Australia. As soon as we have someone who is approved by the government to manufacture it and produce it it would become available to all women through that off-label prescribing."" Glad you asked. Basically, when a drug is approved, it's approved for a certain condition or group of patients. However, doctors can use their expertise to look at your condition, look at the drugs available and say that they'll prescribe you one that isn't designed for that very condition, but that it might work well anyway. ""A doctor can use their own judgement and say, 'Well I know it’s not meant to be for this, but I’m prescribing it for you because I think it can still be useful'. A doctor can still do that, although we are trying to train them to not do that,"" Dr. Wheate says. Assuming the government approves somebody to manufacture medicinal cannabis soon, technically a doctor can prescribe you cannabis for period pain if they have a legitimate belief it will help manage pain. Women confess their most embarrassing period stories. Post continues after video. According to Dr. Wheate, women would not need to wait for a clinical trial to prove its usefulness to necessarily get access to it. ""That could be important because I haven’t yet heard of any studies looking into that, so it might be many, many, many years if we’re waiting for a clinical trial to approve that,"" he says. However, it's still important to be reminded that although many benefits of medicinal cannabis are known, we haven't totally uncovered its impact and side effects if it is prescribed for period pain. Like any drug, there are short-term side effects that come with taking it. According to Dr. Wheate, medicinal cannabis comes with increased heart rate, increased risk of stroke, short-term memory problems and it can bring on anxiety, psychosis and panic. However, to know the full extent of the side effects, Dr. Wheate believes ""we need to look into a lot more than what we are"". ""The bigger issue here is that the period pain and the cramps aren’t going to go away with time, so if you’re using medicinal cannabis for pain relief or mood stabilisation, you’re going to be on it for a long time. And there are direct links between cannabis use and mental illness and lots of other chronic problems. I wouldn’t want anyone to use it as a long time solution,"" he says. It's not as if period pain is a cause that has been ignored for years. Of course, no-one has found a perfect way to cure cramps and pain, but there's no shortage of drugs. Medicinal cannabis is just, Dr. Wheate believes, another option. ""I am all for people having as many options as possible and finding what works best for them. I can see medicinal cannabis playing a much larger role over the coming decade and I would have no problem having it being used to treat things like period pain and cramps,"" he says. The sooner the better, it worksWe are not criminals for finding a method that works, and with little to no side effects for me personally  Yes, and can we get it for Crohns Disease and Ulcerative Colitis soon too please? We are so slow to adopt new medicines here in Australia without 5 different double blind placebo trials -well thats what is feels like anyway when you are desperately waiting for some relief from pain! Please fast track the approval of suppliers, and be abit lenient with the off label prescribing. Not every illness or ailment such as period pain have a vocal lobby group advocating for that particular illness to be on the approved list.","Dec 22, 2016 ...

https://www.mamamia.com.au/medicinal-marijuana-legalised-in-australia/,"Medicinal cannabis legalised in Victoria, child epilepsy patients to be given access from 2017.","April 12, 2016","  Victoria has become the first state in Australia to legalise the use of medicinal cannabis. Children with severe epilepsy will be the first to access to the drug in 2017, Victoria’s Health Minister Jill Hennessy said, after the Access to Medicinal Cannabis Bill passed Parliament. The legislation enables the manufacture, supply and access to medicinal cannabis products in the state. “We’re starting with these children with severe epilepsy, whose lives have been shown to improve so significantly, because we know these children often don’t make it until adulthood,” Ms Hennessy said. “We want to improve the quality of their life.” She said it also meant parents of children with the disorder have to purchase the drug illegally. “I just think that in this day and age, it’s unfair and unacceptable to ask a parent to make a decision between obeying the law and acting in the best interests of their child,” she said. “Those parents will no longer have that dilemma.” Ms Hennessy has said access to the drug — available in a variety of forms, including tinctures, oils, capsules, sprays and vaporisable liquids — would be rolled out gradually and eventually be made available to palliative care and those with HIV. The Government said it would set up an Office of Medicinal Cannabis to oversee the manufacture of the drugs and would educate doctors and patients about their role and eligibility for the scheme. An independent body will also provide advice on the introduction of the drug, which is also legal in more than 20 states in the United States, Spain and Israel. First state in Australia.

The Victorian Government will undertaking a small-scale, strictly controlled cannabis cultivation trial at a Victorian research facility. The Queensland Government last year announced that a trial to treat children with epilepsy with medicinal cannabis would take place this year. New South Wales Premier Mike Baird this year announced 330 patients suffering nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy would take part in a clinical trial using a cannabis-derived tablet manufactured by a Canadian company. The medicinal cannabis trial is the third of its kind in NSW after trials involving terminally ill patients and children with severe epilepsy.

https://www.mamamia.com.au/medical-cannabis-australia/,'My son was having 10 'knockout' seizures a week. This is the only thing that's made it stop.',"January 10, 2019","We first realised our son Cooper, six, had Epilepsy two years ago, most likely resulting from his chromosome deletion. Cooper faces many challenges daily as he learns to walk and talk and feed, but hands down his Epilepsy has been his worst hurdle to date. We’ve tried an array of traditional medications over the years but with very little success. Throughout our trial of the various medications, he was still having a lot of seizures. Most of the seizures were what we call ‘knockouts’, where he would go stiff and stare vacantly for 60 to 90 seconds. After these seizures it was like he had jogged a marathon, Coop would sleep for up to five hours. He was averaging about 10 of these a week and sometimes two to three a day. We tried everything, hoping for some miracle – nothing worked, not even the strongest medications. The first I heard about cannabis oil was through a therapy mum. Coop does most of his therapy at the NAPA Centre in Lane Cove. One of the mums there had been sourcing cannabis oil from a health and wellbeing store in Western Australia. I thought why not and ordered some too – we had nothing to lose. The cannabis oil was OK, but it certainly wasn’t stopping Cooper’s seizures. I persevered with it until the government put a freeze on this type of cannabis oil and we then we couldn’t buy it anymore. Later, I went to a Hemp Expo and found a place in Nimbin that sold cannabis products. My husband and I knew this would be risky but were out of options. We were very keen to get Cooper on a medical cannabis clinical trial but, unfortunately, he didn’t fit the criteria. In October 2017, after a lot of pleading on my part, my paediatrician told me you could now legally access medical cannabis through a prescription, which is properly dosed and trialled, like any other pharmaceutical. He recommended a product from a Canadian company called Tilray, one of the biggest producers of medical cannabis in the world. I researched them and found they are also involved with many trials here in Australia and while they’re a global company, they also have an Australian base. We started on the Tilray product just over 12 months ago. Our paediatrician guided us through the use, starting Cooper on small doses morning and night. It took a bit of time to get into his system and we were conservative in our approach. By the time we reached what was considered a reasonable dose for a 15kg child, it was the end of January. We had our last seizure on February 18 2018. This medication has changed our life. We need Coop to thrive, to put on weight, but with every kilo comes a potential increase in dose – which ultimately means a further increase in price. Unfortunately, medical cannabis is not subsidised on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) like other pharmaceutical medications. We are in a position where we are paying out of pocket for a medication that has changed Cooper and our family’s life. I believe this medication should be recognised and covered accordingly by the government like the other pharmaceuticals that have tried and failed us over the years. We are not wealthy by any means, but we will do whatever it takes. I’m a mum who will pay any amount of money to get a rid of these seizures. No family should have to live with the worry and uncertainty attached to seizures. They are 100 per cent life controlling. This medication has given us back our lives. I would never have believed this possible 12 months ago. For us the results have been amazing. For this reason, we are committed. My husband and I would do whatever we have to do to ensure we are in a financial position to be able to keep this up. The government needs to make it easier for people to have access to medical cannabis, but not at the price we are having to pay. Products should be covered by the PBS nationally. In Victoria there is a Compassionate Access Scheme for seriously ill children with severe intractable epilepsy and in Tasmania the government is subsidising medical cannabis for patients through all hospital pharmacies. We still have a lot of ground to cover. Being the parent of a rare bear, life is tough enough. When there is something out there that works, shouldn’t this be available for everyone? I don’t want any family to go through what we went through. I believe everyone should have access to this amazing product. At the moment we are in the best position that we have been in years. Cooper started big school and we haven’t had to miss a day. I hope this continues.","Jan 9, 2019 ... Medicinal cannabis: Six-year-old Cooper was having two to three horrific seizures a day.

The NSW Government has announced it has secured a cannabis-based medicine from the United Kingdom for 40 child patients. The oral drug known as Epidiolex has already been trialled overseas. NSW Premier Mike Baird said children in the state with the most severe cases of the condition would now have access to the drug. “I have spoken to some of those parents, I’ve been moved by their tears,” he said. “I just can’t imagine what it would be like to stand there, to be there, to look at your children suffering and continuing to suffer. “Sometimes you can provide hope and today is one of those days.” The 40 children will be eligible for the drug under a compassionate access scheme. The scheme will be administered outside of separate trials for medicinal cannabis that start in New South Wales later this year. Dr John Lawson from the Sydney Children’s Hospital in Randwick said it was unfortunate the drug was initially being limited to a small number of children. But he was optimistic the upcoming medicinal cannabis trials would increase the number of patients given access to the treatment. “Hopefully we will have hundreds involved in the next 12 months [in the trials],” he said. Dr Lawson said the children who were given the drug would be monitored over a period of 12 weeks. “This is not a miracle for everyone,” he said. “Maybe one in 10 will have a very good response and maybe one in three will have a good response. “But this is in a group where there has been no hope.” This post originally appeared on ABC News.      © 2015 Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

David was born with a condition known as Dravet syndrome. He had his first seizure when he was five months old, and now has up to nine seizures a month. “If it could reduce his seizures, it would be fantastic,” Ms Tankey, who lives in Victoria, said. The 14-year-old boy is about to start a new trial of medicinal cannabis, run by Professor Ingrid Scheffer from the University of Melbourne. Her team published what has been called the first scientific evidence that medicinal cannabis helps children with severe epilepsy. The research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed cannabinol is “as good as some of the best anti-epilepsy medications”. David has a tremor, difficulties walking and hyperactivity. “We’re really hoping that his quality of life will improve,” Ms Tankey said. Of 120 children in Professor Scheffer’s study, 40 per cent had their seizures halved and 5 per cent became seizure free. Professor Scheffer said the findings were critically important. “It’s the first scientific evidence that cannabidiol is effective for uncontrolled seizures in Dravet syndrome,” she said. “Until now, there has only been anecdotal evidence but now we have scientific evidence proving that medicinal cannabis is definitely effective in severe epilepsy.” Epilepsy Action Australia said the study confirmed what many families have been saying for years. Chief executive Carol Ireland hoped the study prompts authorities to speed up processes to make medicinal cannabis much more accessible in Australia. “Families still can’t for the most part get access to a legal product right now, it’s still quite difficult, there’s not a lot of product around, there are issues with the price of product that is available and having someone prescribe it for you,” she said. “So this study doesn’t solve that for the families in that situation right now.” This post originally appeared on ABC News.

As an infant she would sometimes have more than 1,000 brain-damaging seizures a day — that’s one every 15 seconds. When Katelyn reached six months of age, and it was clear regular treatments had failed her, Lambert turned to medical cannabis, which he said “saved her life.” Before he began treating her with cannabis oil, she had a one in two chance of dying before she was 18 years old and a 100 per cent chance of intellectual disability. “Katelyn is well. Every day without a seizure is a good day,” he told Mamamia. Lambert has a Federal permit to import cannabis but under NSW law it is still illegal for him to possess it, he said. Regardless, there is a law that allows NSW police to use their discretion when it comes to the drug. Lambert's home-grown cannabis plant.

But for 17-year-old Lindsay Carter, suffering from a terminal brain tumour, frequent seizures and chronic pain, it’s too little, too late. On last night’s 60 Minutes, Lindsay’s mother Lanai Carter made a desperate plea to save her son. For Lindsay, chemotherapy is not an option, and surgery will only worsen his condition. The only thing that improves his quality of life is medicinal marijuana – and he can’t get it. “When Lindsay is able to have medical cannabis, it makes a huge difference to his quality of life,” says his mother. “It reduces his seizures, it manages his pain and his nausea – and one really major thing is that it actually helps to stimulate his appetite.” While traditional cancer treatments aren't appropriate for Lindsay's condition, there is one thing that appears to have an effect on his tumour: a controversial cannabis oil, which his family travelled to the United States to obtain. That treatment shrunk his train tumour by an astounding 7mm - but, like other marijuana, it's illegal where Lindsay lives in Queensland. ""We've been to the US four times in 2014,"" Lanai Carter told 60 Minutes. ""That took a tremendous toll emotionally, financially on our family. We wiped out our superannuation trying to get our son to a country where he can get this treatment legally. And it's just been incredibly hard."" Watch a snippet of last night's episode of 60 Minutes below (post continues).   The family hasn't been able to make the trip to the US since 2014 for financial reasons. Meanwhile, Linday's tumour is growing and his condition is deteriorating. The family's only hope was to petition the Federal Government to allow the import of the cannabis oil for Lindsay's use. After a year of work, her application was granted - only to be met by more bureaucratic red tape at the State level. Despite being approved by the Federal Government for Lindsay's use, the Queensland Government must now approve the medicine. ""They are putting my son's life at risk by playing God,"" Carter says. ""Queensland is just trying to do the same process over again, and it's unjust that they should put any patient through that."" Queensland Health, for their part, say they have an obligation to be as ""thorough as possible"" - but what terrible risk they're searching for remains unclear in a terminal case like Lindsay's. ""I would never want other families to have to go through what we've had to go through to try and treat a child with a medicine,"" Carter says. ""It's just insane.""","Apr 17, 2016 ...

The Federal Government has approved the sale of medicinal marijuana after the first licence for private cultivation was issued last week. The drug — used to treat patients with chronic or painful illnesses including cancer, severe epilepsy and motor neurone disease — could be available under the Government’s new scheme in eight weeks. Currently, the medication is sourced from overseas on a case-by-case basis, a system involving delays. Health Minister Greg Hunt will today announce it can be sold in Australia, if patients visit their doctor to request it. Mr Hunt told the ABC the change would ensure there were sufficient supplies for “all of the medical demand”. “That won’t happen overnight, but what we’ve done here is issue a call for people to be able to establish an interim supply for and within Australia through importation,” he said. “Last year, the law was put in place which made medicinal cannabis available. Now however I want to … deal immediately with the question of supply.” The Government last year legalised medicinal cannabis use and states regulate its cultivation, with Victoria having already harvested its first cannabis crop for medicinal use by people with epilepsy. Mr Hunt praised Victoria for its work in cultivating the crop, citing the need for “safe, high quality, appropriately obtained medicine”. He said there was also a private cultivation program being developed for long-term supply with the first licence issued last week. But the Australian Medical Association (AMA) has urged caution about the sale of medicinal cannabis. AMA vice-president Tony Bartone said many doctors were still waiting to see the results of clinical trials. “The majority are still waiting for the proof, the reliable trials, the clinical evidence to come in,” Dr Bartone said.

As the debate surrounding the medical usage of cannabis in Australia wages on, a case involving a father giving his dying daughter cannabis oil to alleviate her symptoms has captured the hearts and minds of many. Over 50,000 people have now signed a petition to save a man called Adam Koessler, who they’re describing as a “fearless father”. Koessler was arrested and charged this month, after giving his two-year-old daughter, Rumer Rose, cannabis oil as an alternative treatment for stage four neuroblastoma. After taking the little girl from Cairns to Brisbane for an oncologist’s appointment.  Koessler was arrested on January 2 at the Lady Cilento Children’s hospital and charged with giving dangerous drugs to a person under 16 and possession. Koessler claims that after administering the oil with some coconut, little Rumer showed vast signs of improvement. “Her cancer-ridden little body was alive again,” he told the Newcastle Herald. “I saw first hand that the cannabis oil was extremely beneficial and I hope I simply did what any father would do.” Koesslar had posted bail to appear in court tomorrow — but part of his bail conditions prohibits the father from contact with his daughter, whose condition has severely worsened since being taken off the treatment. Little Rumer is now in intensive care, the Newcastle Herald reports.   Cannabis activists have rallied behind the father, with an outpouring of support coming through in the name of petitions, Facebook pages and donations. The Change.org petition asks for Queen Premier  Campbell Newman and justice minster Jarrod Bleijie to intervene in Koessler’s case and “have his parental rights to see his child reinstated, the charges against him dismissed by a court and the right to decide the treatment options  of his own child”. “It is inhumane and unjust to keep a parent, who acted out of love for his child, wanting to prolong her life, away from her during such severe illness” and that “Medicinal cannabis oil, its supply and use, should be decriminalised in Australia without further delay,” the petition, which now has more than 59,000 signatures, argues. Adam Koesslar’s arrest comes at a period in which the medical use, along with the legalisation of cannabis is hotly contested. In the US, many states have already started legalising the use of medical cannabis. Australia looks to follow the US, with the Victoria government moving towards legalising its use by the end of the year and New South Wales running trials with cannabis to treat epileptic children and terminally ill patients.  What do you think of the use of medical cannabis? Should it be used to treat patients?    Medical Cannabis is clearly showing that it can help some people.....some children. People have developed a superstition about this product and it's pretty childish. I don't think that it's intended for use INSTEAD of current medical treatments so why not add it to those available ?Parents with gravely ill children are traumatised enough without removing what just might be an important addition to their child's medical routine. Drug companies are raking in profits so I can imagine their interference in a product they can't as yet control.Time to apply some kindness and logic.........and fast. While I completely support the legalisation of cannabis for recreational use and think there is some medicinal value in cannabis this situation has me concerned. Cannabis may be the best course of action for this kid but the dad sounds like some kind of whacko and probably shouldn't be making the call. Of course it could be that the mother is irrationally opposed to using cannabis and the father is the one be logical. In a perfect world the doctor would be able to advise if cannabis is a good idea but that obviously can't happen, at least officially, so the decision must lie with the parents. In the end the whole problem comes back to this absurd prohibition. Whatever the truth of the situation keeping a dad from his sick child seems a big drastic, surely supervised visits would be a reasonable compromise.","Jan 18, 2015 ...

Medicinal marijuana changed that.""","November 23, 2017","Fifteen years ago, I went out to buy a Christmas tree in the Adelaide hills and came home with a rescue kitten instead. My boyfriend at the time was not impressed. It’s sort of a long story. On a sunny Wednesday afternoon last month, that much older cat of fifteen years lost the ability to walk. By the afternoon, she was completely paralysed and I rushed her in to see the vet. Prognosis? Not good. Definitely neurological. Cause undetermined. After a short exam, the vet advised me to take her to a cat neurologist if ‘money is no object”. Unfortunately for Charli, money is in fact an object in our house and we simply do not have enough of it to take her for spinal taps and MRI's with a cat neurologist. Especially since my little mouser just turned fifteen, the vet in no uncertain terms recommended that I take her home, make her comfortable and hope to see improvement in her function (which his face told me he seriously doubted). If not, then I needed to consider euthanasia as a serious option. The best he could do was provide fluids and sent me home to discuss the options with my husband, since I refused to put her to sleep without him there. Somehow, she survived the night, but was barely clinging to life and twitching uncontrollably. She managed to drag herself into my closet and I thought for sure I would find her cold body amongst my shoes in the morning. I thought she had gone blind, as she didn't flinch or respond to my hand in front of her face. With a broken heart, I made the decision the first thing the next morning to release her from her pain. Unfortunately, we couldn't get her in to be euthanized until later that day. My husband gently asked me one question ""Are you sure you are ready to let her go?"" My husband knows I am a realist who prefers to end a pet's suffering rather than needlessly extending their natural life. He also knows that I have had Charli since I was 20 years old. She has lived with me in seven different houses on two continents. She has been by my side through good times and bad. She is the very last of my three rescue pets I brought with me when I moved from Australia to California.
I mulled this over. No, I wasn't ready to let her go. No, I didn't want her to suffer this way. No, I didn't have thousands of dollars to spend on definitively diagnosing her neurological problem (which most likely couldn't be fixed). Yes, she did seem to be stubbornly clinging to life. What could I do? In my desperation, a vague idea started to form in the corners of my mind. Of the possibilities the vet had described as the potential cause of her symptoms, I reasoned the most likely was a brain tumor. Right before my nana died from breast cancer in 2013, several friends had sent me information on how medicinal marijuana could be used to treat cancer. I had read numerous articles and watched documentaries on the ability of cannabidiol (CBD) in Cannabis to shrink tumors. Could this work for my cat? What did I have to lose? I didn't even know for sure if she actually had a brain tumor, or whether she had had a stroke or a bacterial/viral infection such as meningitis which were other possible causes of her symptoms. None of these suspected causes had a particularly good outcome. But, she purred when I stroked her fur, and I knew she was still in her poor, frozen body. By the time early afternoon on Thursday had rolled around, Charli had actually shown some improvement and had regained a little strength in her front legs. I agreed to give her the weekend to try to rest and recover, as long as she wasn't in copious amounts of pain, and look into CBD oil as a treatment alternative. CBD oil is made from Cannabis strains high in CBD and low in THC (the compound that gets people stoned). Thus, CBD oil typically doesn't get users high. It is purely for therapeutic benefit, without the harsh side effects that you typically find with prescribed pharmaceutical drugs. LISTEN: Sorry to all the parents of fur babies, but they’re just animals.
 Now - I've never been a pot smoker. Thanks to the 'Just Say No' campaign in the 80's, I thought marijuana was a terrible and destructive drug for a long time. I have witnessed firsthand, people very close to me that have had some pretty serious problems with pot. My viewpoint has shifted in recent years however, simply due to education. Now that I live in California, the laws and the attitudes towards both medicinal and recreational marijuana use are very different than in Australia. I have a dear friend who has Multiple Sclerosis. Medicinal marijuana has immensely relieved the severity of her symptoms and provides excellent daily pain relief for her. It's incredible to watch the immediate effect marijuana has on her physically when she has a spastic attack. She goes from being cramped up and basically unable to move or get around, to relaxed and 'normal' within minutes. It does so without the harsh side effects that come with the many pills she must take each day. It is also more cost effective in the long run – some of her prescribed medications cost thousands of dollars each month in the United States. Whilst it essentially amounted to a shot in the dark, we made the decision to treat our cat with CBD oil, since the alternative was obviously to put her out of her misery. We started her on CBD oil the following Monday. It's surprisingly easy to get CBD oil in California – you can order it online these days, although you have to do your due diligence and find a quality product. I have to say – the results were ASTONISHING. Her right pupil had been dilated for days (a possible indicator of a brain tumor) and went back to normal the day after she started on the CBD oil. Within four days of starting on CBD oil twice a day, Charli started to eat and drink on her own again. Prior to that, she had been refusing all food and water and I had to keep her hydrated (and alive) by using a baby syringe to get water down her throat. Five days after starting on the CBD oil, she was able to use her front legs again and was able to slowly sit up and prop herself up against walls and furniture, even though her back legs still did not work. The following day, her back legs started to work again, but she was weak and wobbly and struggled to take more than a few steps. A full week after starting on CBD oil, our cat was up and walking again – albeit tentatively. All in all, our lively and friendly cat spent two weeks in our bedroom ICU, confined to a towel on a pee pad, unable to move or get to her food or kitty litter. Our vet did not have an expectation of a positive outcome for her. Things were not looking good. Cannabis saved her life. A month on, and Charli is 95% her previous self. She shows no real signs of any illness. She can jump up on chairs again. Her appetite and toileting habits are back to normal. Her head tic is gone. Her pupils are back to normal. Because I've had her for so long, I can see that she doesn't walk quite as well as she once did, but most people wouldn't know otherwise. She has resumed her life of luxury and spends her days sunning herself in the window, or lounging on the couch. If I hadn't seen it myself, I wouldn't believe it. The change was MIRACULOUS. My fifteen year old cat was dead. D.E.A.D. Medicinal marijuana changed that. After we started the treatment, several friends shared their own stories and told me they are convinced they have been able to keep their pets alive by including CBD oil in their diet. Multiple people admitted to treating their older cats and dogs upwards of the past three years. It got me thinking – why didn't I know about this? Why isn't medicinal marijuana widely used to treat very serious health problems in both people and pets, when there appears to be a wealth of anecdotal evidence in support of it? Wil Anderson for example, has been very candid about his support of Cannabis for medicinal use, and his long term struggles with chronic pain. Here's a fun fact. Did you know that the US Government owns Patent no. 6,630,507 for the pharmaceutical use of Cannabinoids as an antioxidant and neuroprotectant? This patent was filed in 1999 and approved in 2003. Fairly interesting stuff, given the history of the war on drugs in the United states. The very first patent in the US for isolating CBD dates back to 1942. According to the Australian Hemp Party, Cannabis possession is illegal except under certain circumstances in each Australian state or territory. However, the laws vary widely between the states. The Turnbull government purportedly wants to enable the safe and legal distribution of medicinal cannabis, with the aim for it to become a standardized medicine like any other. There are many prominent medical professionals in Australia who support reform when it comes to the use of Cannabis for medicinal use. Dr Alex Wodak AM, is a notable advocate of drug reform laws and believes the basic problem is the negative attitudes to medicinal cannabis hanging over from the prohibition of recreational cannabis. Controversial Sydney doctor, Dr Andrew Katelaris ""The Pot Doctor"" has treated many people with Cannabinoids in the last decade, and says he has seen children go from wheelchairs to pushbikes after treatment. ""There has been considerable publicity in Australia concerning medical cannabis as more people are being successfully treated for a range of serious conditions. ""It was originally proposed that there be an independent office of medical cannabis to oversee the growing, production and distribution of medical cannabis. However, Australians can only source expensive, overseas, 'approved' cannabis. A licence has been issued for local growing but it is still under TGA control."" The TGA has approved one medicinal cannabis product for use, Sativex, but no stock is held locally in Australia. There are in the vicinity of 800 natural chemicals in the cannabis plant including approximately the 100 referred to as cannabinoids. Our bodies naturally produce endocannabinoids and therefore we have receptors in our brain and body which the cannabinoids in cannabis can easily bind to. Laurence E Mather, DMedSc, Emeritus Professor of Anaesthesia at The University of Sydney is a researcher in pain management and was able to explain to me the basic science of why cannabinoids have a range of therapeutic benefits and why it has been so hard to regulate. The essence is not complicated. The nub of the issue is that various components of the cannabis plant have been found over very many years to be useful as medications by humans. This is essentially the same as have been found for innumerable other plants used as medications, think, as examples, morphine-type chemicals in opium, digitalis-type chemicals in foxglove, atropine type chemicals in belladonna, etc. Folkloric preparations evolved over centuries if not millennia, and when science caught up, synthetic or at least semi-synthetic versions of such. There are several issues, however, that need amplification. Because of its being from a natural plant source, the chemical composition of any cannabis preparation is likely to depend on the plant strain, growing conditions, harvesting conditions, apart from the medicament making process, and thus could be of uncertain pharmacological outcome. LISTEN: Mamamia Out Loud - Who let the dogs in? 
 The mode of administration also alters the chemical composition that ultimately gets into the body, and this too has implications for effect. The nature of the condition being treated, as well as variability in the conditions being treated in that individual, also can lead to uncertainty in outcomes and successes. Hence, hard evidence for effectiveness of cannabinoid pharmacotherapy is problematic, and this creates difficulties for regulatory bodies. Anecdotal evidence and the like is not regarded particularly highly by regulatory authorities. And what does Professor Mather think about the use of Cannabis in the treatment of animals? ""Sure, why not? The endogenous cannabinoid system seems to be ubiquitous amongst mammalian species and the successfulness of such treatments would seem to be just as likely as with humans. But then again, so do all of the uncertainties and variables."" Whilst it might not have been particularly scientific, my experiment with CBD oil saved my cat's life. And that's all the science I need. The Amounts Please The Dosage! I am Very Desperate !","Nov 23, 2017 ...

https://www.mamamia.com.au/anti-vaxxers-son-removed/,Queensland anti-vaxxer has disabled son taken from her.,"May 20, 2017","A young disabled boy who was last month snatched from hospital by his anti-vaxxer mother has been taken into the care of authorities after being deemed “at risk”. In a now-deleted video posted to Facebook on Friday night, a number of NSW police and child protection workers appear to enact an order for the removal of the 4-year-old boy, while his distressed mother watches on. The young boy, who suffers cerebral palsy, was last month the subject of a cross-border Amber Alert after his 26-year-old mother removed him from Brisbane's Lady Cilento Hospital before doctors could administer treatment. The boy's mother has claimed she believes her son's condition is a result of vaccination and has built a loyal social media following through her aversion to Western science-based medicine. She claims instead to be healing her son through medicinal cannabis and organic food. In a video posted to social media in January, she claimed Queensland child safety authorities ordered her to take the boy to hospital to be fed “this formula synthetic s**t”. Last night's removal of Chase was also issued on medical grounds following the results of a recent hospital blood test. The Daily Mail reports that the person who captured the Facebook video can be heard saying, 'The police are trying to take [the boy]… they're going to put him on poisonous food and medicine again.' NSW police confirmed to Mamamia this morning that a young boy had been taken into the care of authorities. ""At 4.30pm on Friday the 19th police attended a premises on Hunter Street in Newcastle in support of Family and Corrective Services regarding a child at risk,"" a spokesperson said. ""After extensive negotiations, a four-year-old boy was taken to John Hunter hospital for medical assessment."" The child is reportedly still in the care of authorities. I worked in childcare for over 8yrs in a high migrant area. I witnessed children from many underprivileged countries lining up to be vaccinated mainly because of deaths that had affected those families. When a child is sick and has been in care generally it goes right through a centre. Yes an immunized child can still contract measles or chicken pox but its not to the same degree as not being immunized. I get angry mainly because the parents were immunized themselves and clearly suffered no issues from having been so. I know how difficult it is to remove a child from a parent. Police just cannot waltz in and grab a kid. There must be a reason. This woman was giving her child cannabis. Is she a qualified medical practitioner to do so, ie a doctor or qualified nurse who has full knowledge of correct dosages. Also where this mother lives is in a State whereby use of cannabis is illegal. She broke the law. All mothers endeavor to provide fresh vegetables and fruits to their families. Thats a good thing but she is no different and cannot use this as an excuse. Personally i feel she was putting her child at risk. Had this child died from her actions would people say it was right what she had done or would she be viewed as being neglectful? Would people question why the child had not been removed? Of course the answers would be a resounding yes. The boy was clearly striving after she fed him proper food and helped his seizures with cannabis oil which is well known to treat and heal such conditions. I pray for Chase to be home soon with his loving parents. ♡♡♡ Had he been thriving his blood test results would've reflected that. They didn't and she broke the law. ","May 19, 2017 ...

https://www.mamamia.com.au/cbd-oil-australia/,Over-the-counter cannabis oil is now a thing Australia. But we have questions.,"June 3, 2020"," A few weeks ago, I received a Facebook message from my mum that perfectly sums up the confusion around ‘cannabis’ beauty products. “Darling, does this have… dope… in it?” she asked alongside a photo of The Body Shop Hemp Hand Cream I sent her. It made me giggle, but considering the tube has a big ole cannabis-esque plant on the front and an ‘earthy’ fragrance, I don’t blame her for being confused. WATCH: Here’s what the horoscopes are up to with self-care in isolation. Post continues after video. Recently, low-dose cannabidiol (CBD), also known as cannabis oil, was approved to be available over-the-counter in pharmacies across Australia.  According to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), this means you're now able to buy CBD products without a referral, special approval or prescription. So, you can only expect to see more and more ‘cannabis’ serums, face oils, body creams and hair products pop up in the beauty aisles. Naturally, your mind goes to marijuana or CBD oil when you see the word ‘cannabis’. So, what can they actually do for your skin? The answer comes down to two things, my friends: green marketing, and some science. First thing to know: Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil is another fancy name for Hemp Seed Oil, which, let’s face it, just doesn’t sound as sexy. Then, to understand the difference between cannabis sativa seed/hemp seed oil, CBD oil AND the cannabis used, erm, recreationally, think of the cannabis sativa plant (the plant all of the above come from) like an apple with juicy flesh and the seeds near the core. Cannabis sativa plants have leaves, flowers and seeds that contain around 500 cannabinoids (compounds secreted in the cannabis plant). In the leaves and flowers, you’ll find the two major ones: cannabidiol (CBD or medicinal cannabis) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC or marijuana/recreational cannabis). CBD oil is now available over-the-counter in pharmacies across Australia  – so, you no longer need a prescription from a doctor to buy it. According to the TGA, you can purchase a daily maximum dose of 150mg, with products limited to a maximum of one per cent THC.  Moving on to cannabis sativa seed/hemp seed oil. This comes from the seeds of the cannabis sativa plant, and doesn’t contain any of the medicinal or psychoactive properties of CBD and THC. In other words, cannabis sativa seed/hemp seed oil is not the same as CBD oil and doesn’t have any medicinal benefits used to help manage pain and chronic health conditions. Oh, and it definitely won’t get you high. Therefore, it’s also legal and can be purchased wherever you buy beauty products. OK cool, but what does cannabis sativa seed/hemp seed oil actually do, then? A few things. It has anti-inflammatory properties that are great for reducing inflammation that presents as acne, rosacea and other skin conditions. It’s also a non-comedogenic emollient, so it’ll hydrate the skin without clogging your pores. Sometimes, you'll find it in a formula with other popular skincare oils like jojoba oil and rosehip oil. Essentially, it’s a lovely, hydrating, soothing face oil that smells a bit like something that could be weed. Where things get tricky is when products are marketed in a green bottle covered with marijuana plants as ‘cannabis’ skin care, and at a premium price. The easiest way to know what you’re actually paying for is to look out for ‘cannabis sativa seed’ in the ingredients list on hemp seed oil products.  Now for the fun bit: product recommendations. If you're keen to give hemp seed oil a try, here are six hemp seed oil beauty products I'm enjoying slathering all over my face and body. I was sent these two 10ml testers from this Aussie-made, vegan and cruelty-free brand. They're the perfect size to see if a botanical, hempy-smelling face oil is for you before committing to a full-size bottle. Both serums have a very light, almost dry oil consistency, and contain hemp seed oil (the renewal serum's is unfiltered so you have to shake the bottle before using). The clarifying serum also features squalane, and rosehip, argan and jojoba oils. In the renewal serum, you'll find jojoba, rosehip, broccoli seed and camellia oils, among others. You Beauty co-host Kelly McCarren loves this face mask for glowing skin and talks about it constantly. The natural product features the brand's own patented CannaCell® hemp stem cells complex, as well as organic hemp seed oil. Apply to clean, dry or damp skin and wait for 10-20 minutes before gently rinsing off. Glow city! How gorgeous does this green bottle look? RAWKANVAS is a new-ish Aussie-made, vegan and cruelty-free brand and I've been applying this body oil all over my limbs straight out of my evening shower. The body oil has a serumy texture and really does sink into the skin very quickly. It also has a lush, sleepy scent that's a mix of hemp, citrus and ylang ylang. As it's made using essential oils, it's not recommended for use during pregnancy or when trying to become pregnant – always double check with your medical professional. The Body Shop's hemp hand cream has come up over and over again in the You Beauty Facebook group because it's just a really bloody good hand cream. It's intensely hydrating, sinks in quickly and doesn't leave your hands feeling sticky or slimy. It also makes an excellent gift. This recommendation actually comes from my partner, but I agree it's a great affordable hemp seed face oil. The silky formula also contains jojoba oil and macadamia seed oil for further anti-bacterial benefits, and smells natural, but not too earthy. Last but not least, the oil that kicked this trend off. This one is great for congested and/or inflamed skin. It does smell very hempy, but the packaging looks chic in my bathroom. The texture is fairly light but still takes a while to sink into the skin, so I only use a drop or two when massaging into my face at night. I can't say whether it's reduced my redness and blemishes, but it's a lovely product to use and my skin feels plump and hydrated after use. Feature Image: Getty.

https://www.mamamia.com.au/wil-anderson-medical-marijuana/,Wil Anderson helped an 80-year-old woman get into medical marijuana.,"April 1, 2016","  Wil Anderson is one of Australia’s funniest people. The comedian and Gruen host has a stellar career at home and overseas, two successful podcasts (if you haven’t listened to Wilosophy yet – do) and an all-round funny dude. But he is in almost constant pain. He suffers from osteoarthritis in his hips. And uses medical marijuana to cope with the constant aching of joints. On the latest episode of Meshel Laurie’s Nitty Gritty Committee, Wil spoke about how medicinal marijuana has helped him cope. You can hear him, and some other very funny people, talk about that, here: “A huge amount of our population doesn’t sleep properly because their pain wakes them up, or has to manage their pain by either drugs or something else throughout their life.” “And because it’s chronic pain and it is ongoing, I think that it is one of those things that it’s almost like a hidden pain.” Wil told Meshel. A photo posted by Wil Anderson (@wilarious) on Jul 25, 2014 at 10:19am PDT Earlier this week actress and TV host Whoopi Goldberg announced she would launch a cannabis-infused line of products aimed at women to help them cope with pain. “People who have chronic pain are really susceptible to depression. When I was talking about using medicinal marijuana I got this letter from an 80-year-old woman, and she said: “‘I’ve never really liked you, but now I like you… I have never broken the law in my life, but I have the same thing as you, osteoarthritis in my hips…. (and I thought, ‘Great I have the same hips as an 80-year-old woman’) and she said the only thing that helped her hips was medical marijuana – and she felt so ashamed of it because it’s illegal here and she had to use it – and she was really grateful that I’d spoken about it. ” “But it was the sign-off of the letter that I loved the most, she goes – ‘and by the way, I’m 80. I’ve never broken the law, I’ve paid taxes all my life and I make biscuits everyday… and I think those biscuits might be cookies. I think they might be medical cookies.” Nanna baking skills have never been more useful, obviously.   When did he get his doctorate? I missed that news. And where is his research published? I just find it hard to respect Wil Anderson any more after seeing him live where he made extremely offensive rape and sexual assault jokes. Awful :-(","Apr 1, 2016 ...

https://www.mamamia.com.au/medical-marijuana-for-epilepsy/,Max found out he had epilepsy at 16. Medical marijuana might be his best chance at a normal life.,"November 7, 2016","Max was 16 when his symptoms first started. “It started as a nauseous feeling every month or two. This built into stronger feelings of nausea that were more frequent. They then became so strong I was unable to focus on what other people were saying and what I was saying just went quiet,” he told Mamamia. “One night I was at a party and my memory just blanked out. My girlfriend at the time took me into the bathroom and waited for me to ‘come to’. I couldn’t remember anything that had just happened.” It was at this point Max decided he should see to a doctor. “The epilepsy diagnosis was soon overshadowed by the brain tumour news,” Max’s mum, Elizabeth said. “We had to wait a month or so over Christmas to compare a follow up MRI to see whether the tumour was growing and to find out whether it was benign. It was heart breaking.” “You just want perfection and an easy life for your kids and this was so shockingly far from that,” she continued. “The mood of everything just changed, it was an absolute challenge to maintain life as normal. It was most important to maintain strength for Max, not be one of those flip out mothers.” A benign tumour was found in Max’s brain, the cause of his epileptic seizures. Because of the tumour’s location, an operation to remove it was – and still is – too dangerous. Max’s diagnosis has meant extreme life changes for the now 18-year-old. He’s not able to drive; he’s not able to work in jobs like retail or hospitality; he can’t do anything that might be dangerous if a seizure hits. He had started doing stand-up comedy before the diagnosis. He’s now quietly script writing a sit-com at home instead. “I get about 10 seconds of warning before a seizure hits, it’s this weird feeling of building nausea. It’s like my teeth and tongue turn into different textures,” Max said. “If I’m holding a drink or something, I put it down. During the seizure itself, I usually just dribble all over myself. Tapping my hand on my leg. Sometimes people will hand me tissues and I don’t know what to do with them. Sometimes they’re more intense, and there is more chewing of my mouth and tapping of my hands. I don’t remember any of this. This is just what people tell me. Coming out of a seizure feels like being woken up in the middle of the night from the deepest sleep. You feel so vague. I have no idea what triggers them.”  Medication is all Max has to try and reduce the severity and frequency of the seizures. At the moment Max is on three different types of medication but he’s tried many others. Tablets upon more tablets upon more tablets are now an everyday part of Max’s life. Even with all these pills, he’s still having seizures every three to five days. Taking over his mind, stripping his consciousness, hitting him unpredictably. Any time, any situation. “Watching my son pop a bunch of pills is pretty agonising, but it’s important to be supportive of what’s necessary,” Elizabeth  said. “I’m still not convinced they’ve been great [for him] though. Some have made him dizzy and weary. He had fewer seizures before beginning the pills. But if he tries to stop, they’re worse again.” Side effects like nausea and fatigue are common with epilepsy medication. Max says the pills also affect the way he expresses himself. “When I first started taking medication, I was beginning year 12 and English was my favourite subject. I love writing. I could feel the pills limiting my vocabulary. It was like I had a word on my tongue and I couldn’t get it out. The first lot of medication destroyed the thing I most loved to do, which is write” Max said. “I only take one of the pills at night so the side effects are lessened. It gives you a really drunk feeling, you feel really wibbly wobbly. None of the medications are working fully. They might increase the time period between seizures a little bit. They might help me stay more aware during seizures. But I’m still having regular episodes.” Cannabis might be the solution. A breakthrough clinical trial is currently underway in Australia. It is the first trial using cannabis extract in a gel – applied to the skin twice daily – to reduce symptoms in epileptic adults. The gel could be a new way to reduce epileptic seizures, without the side effects associated with traditional medications. “Medications act by suppressing nerve cell activity. Anything that suppresses nerve cell activity also works to slow the brain down,” neurologist at the Royal Melbourne Hospital Professor Terry O’Brien who is leading the clinical trial told Mamamia. ” These medications come with neurological and psychiatric side effects. Drowsiness. Dizziness. Lack of energy. Even depression and psychosis.” The gel uses the medicinal part of the marijuana plant called cannabidiol (CBD), which acts completely differently to traditional medication. CBD is not the ‘psychoactive’ component of marijuana. The chemical that causes the ‘high’ is called tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and it is not present in the gel extract. “In this trial, the CBD is synthetically manufactured- not botanically produced,” Professor O’Brien said. “Typically, medicinal marijuana still contains a small proportion of THC. This gel has zero THC.” The gel application is a big deal. It’s never been tested before and it’s designed to boost effectiveness, without the nasty side effects. “The problem with the medicinal marijuana that’s been used so far is that it’s oral. This means CBD is broken down in the stomach first, and then metabolised in the liver,” Professor O’Brien said. “Some of the side effects are generated in the stomach and liver, and topical application bypasses this. Oral medication also means most of the CBD is broken down before it reaches the brain, which is where you want it to work. That is why people have traditionally inhaled marijuana. One way of getting around this, which is safer than inhaling it, is topical preparation gel.” Linsday and Lanai’s fight for access to medical marijuana. Post continues below video.
  At the end of year 12, almost a year after his diagnosis, Max went to Schoolies Week on the Gold Coast. During the week away, while staying with friends, Max smoked marijuana for the first time. It was the longest time Max had gone without a seizure since his diagnosis. “I told my doctor (Professor O’Brien) about smoking marijuana and he said ‘well, let’s find a way for this to work legally’,” Max said. “He pointed me to the trial. My parents were very supportive, they were just happy I had seen some kind of result.” “If there’s a time to smoke some weed, schoolies would be it,” Max’s mum said. “None of his friends smoke cigarettes, or party hard. They’re really a great bunch of clever, creative, and driven teenagers. I’ve had no concerns that a few joints would turn them into a horde of junkies.” “It was really a ray of hope that we are living in the right era for medicinal cannabis to be a possibility,” Elizabeth continued. “Max has no desire to be high or sedated all the time, so an extract that is free of THC is ideal. A rub would be less intrusive than swallowing pills.” The implications of this trial are huge. It could mean reduced reliance on medication for epileptic sufferers. It could mean a more ‘normal’ way of life for adults living with epilepsy. It could mean fewer seizures, without the drowsiness and nausea and foggy-mindedness that come with current medications. “We’re hoping that it will be able to control seizures for people whose seizures aren’t controlled in current medication,” Professor O’Brien said. “The gel should be better tolerated, with fewer side effects. The results of this current trial will come through mid next year and they will be critical in how it advances. If possible, it will lead to another trial, an international trial of 300 – 400 people. It will hopefully be available for general prescription within five years.” The participants in the trial, however – like Max – will receive early access to the gel. The trial is happening at the same time medicinal cannabis is being legalised in Australia. Changes by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, which come into effect this month, will mean medicinal cannabis no longer falls under Australia’s most stringent of schedules, used to control the use of the most dangerous drugs. Instead, it will become legal for people who are seriously ill to grow and use marijuana for medicinal purposes. Permits are required. “If [the gel] has any effect at all, that’s appealing,” Max said. “I want to be writing, I want to do things, I don’t want to be living with the side effects of medication or on a high of THC.

https://www.mamamia.com.au/dan-haslam-medical-cannabis/,'Cannabis eased my son's suffering. I'll keep fighting for others to have that right.',"April 9, 2017","In 2010, my happy life as a rural nurse and mother took an unwelcome turn when our third son, Dan, was diagnosed with stage 4 bowel cancer. From that instant our lives changed, as we struggled to accept the reality that our beautiful son — a previously fit 2o-year-old with a bright future and love of life — was facing at best an uncertain future reliant upon aggressive treatments, and at worst a death sentence. When Dan first tried cannabis, we had reached a point of utter desperation. He had endured more than three years of continuous gruelling chemotherapy, multiple major surgeries, oncothermia and radiation. Dan battled anticipatory nausea, where just the thought of chemotherapy would cause him to vomit before he had even left home for treatment. To watch this every fortnight as a parent was absolutely soul destroying. He had tried every available anti-nausea medication but nothing worked. For those who are familiar with the cancer battle, the need to maintain your weight is imperative. Each cycle Dan would lose up to five kilos on chemo week, and spend the next week trying to put it back on before his next treatment. He was depressed and afraid death was knocking at his door. The cycle of depression became indelibly linked to chemotherapy treatment and made us all feel powerless, so when a former cancer patient suggested cannabis we were ready and willing to encourage Dan to try it, despite our long-held view that it was a dangerous gateway drug. My husband had worked for 35 years in the police force with most of that time in the drug squad — but as we soon found out, watching a loved one suffer is motivation to change entrenched attitudes. The first time Dan tried cannabis we watched on nervously but with no real expectations. Nothing had worked so far, so we were used to disappointment. But that day was a game changer: Dan started to use cannabis immediately after chemotherapy and he never vomited again. He regained his ailing appetite and maintaining his weight was no longer an issue. He could be at home with his young wife Alyce and, importantly, he regained some power and control over a situation in which he'd previously had none. Listen: Jane McGrath's best friend Tracy Bevan explains how the McGrath Foundation began. (Post continues after audio.)
 What followed was a journey to educate ourselves, and that journey for me is ongoing. The joy of seeing Dan’s suffering relieved was short lived, as we began to confront the reality that we were in fact criminals because of the legal status of cannabis at that time. That made Dan feel vulnerable, but it filled me with a sense of anger and injustice. This really was a last resort for Dan; it was not about using a recreational drug to get high. It was about giving a dying young man a better quality of life and keeping him at home with family for as long as possible. The general community overwhelmingly supported us when we went public. I realise now this is largely because so many others were quietly using cannabis to treat a wide range of conditions because conventional medications have failed them. As we spoke out, others gained the courage to do so too. Dan and I met many others, including children with intractable epilepsy. That had a huge impact on both of us and spurred us on. During that very public campaign media interest was enormous. That's when I met the lovely Helen Kapalos, who worked with us as presenter on Channel 7's Sunday Night program. Helen and Dan developed a bond that was deep and personal for Helen, who had lost her own mum to cancer years earlier. To my delight and surprise Helen agreed to help me organise the first Australian Medicinal Cannabis Symposium in November 2014. I knew that it was essential to show the policy makers there was science behind the hype and that this was about medicine rather than recreation. During this time, Helen told me she felt the need to follow this story beyond the bounds of commercial television, and she bravely decided to pursue the story further by funding, producing and directing a documentary. Over a few short weeks, the planning for the Symposium and for the filming of the documentary The Truth about Medical Marijuana took place in my kitchen and over long phone calls with Helen in Melbourne and me in Tamworth. Dan’s involvement decreased as he grew sicker and sadly he did not live to see the result of Helen’s creative work, nor did he live long enough to see the legislative changes that resulted from his legacy. I know he would be proud, but I also know he would see all this as unfinished business. Most people choose a path in life that symbolises their personal belief and values, but my path in life was chosen for me. It has taken me on a journey of self-evaluation, education, and included many personal challenges. It has been bitterly sad but Dan’s courage inspires me, and it is surprisingly rewarding to think that many of our sickest and most vulnerable may have the chance for a better life because of his courage. The Truth About Medicinal Marijuana premieres tonight, Sunday 9 April, at 8.30pm on SBS UIC 2017 Medicinal Cannabis Symposium will be held in Melbourne on 23, 24, 25 June, 2017.

https://www.mamamia.com.au/medical-cannabis-trial/,Children will be allowed to use medical cannabis in NSW in a world-first drug trial.,"January 24, 2016","Children with drug-resistant epilepsy in New South Wales are set to receive a cannabis-based medication in a world-first medicinal marijuana trial. From March, terminally-ill adults and sick children alike will be able to use cannabis for medicinal purposes to ease their conditions in this landmark trial for Australia. As the NSW state government prepares to launch the drug trials, hospital ethics committees have officially given their approval. While children in the trial will be given the drug Epidiolex, a liquid drug to be dispensed in syringe droppers,  some 30 terminally ill adults in Newcastle will be given vaporised leaf cannabis to inhale, easing their discomfort and pains while increasing appetite. The children’s trial will be monitored by the Sydney Children’s Hospital in Sydney’s Randwick and Westmead, while the adult trial will take place at the Calvary Mater Hospital in Newcastle. This announcement comes less than a year after Medical Research Minister Pru Goward was in talks in the UK to persuade the world’s top cannabis researchers towards testing cannabinoid medicines in NSW. “There are plenty of countries where you can buy capsules or cookies, but NSW will be the first country to have pharmaceutical-grade products,” Ms Goward said. Epidiolex founder, Dr. Geoffrey Guy rallied for cannabis-based drug trials in Australia over ten years ago and is happy to finally see some progress in the field, “We always look for ­research where we can see a channel all the way to the end product,” he said. Epidiolex contains CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabinoid, proven to alleviate the symptoms of epilepsy. NSW will undertake the fourth and final phase of the Epidiolex trial before it can be approved for the public, while another epilepsy anticonvulsant, the cannabis-based CBDV, is also set to begin it’s phase two trial here. Epilepsy Action Australia CEO Carol Ireland estimates that thousands of families continue to source their own cannabis-based drugs illegally. Ms Goward says a rollout of the compassionate access scheme and various drug trials will come as a relief to many struggling families. A third trial involving cannabis in the treatment of chemotherapy and it’s side-effects is also set to take place, with details to be announced later this year. I wish they'd hurry up and get over the obstinate bias against marijuana. It'd be a life changer to be ""allowed"" to access non-physically damaging and addictive pain relief. Engineer a strain to omit the weird 'high' (I hate it) and I'd be onto it in a heartbeat.  Fantastic news! I fully believe that there are significant medical benefits that come with marijuana (particularly with colon cancer), and it's about time we took it seriously and maximised the benefits.","Jan 24, 2016 ...

https://www.mamamia.com.au/petitions-on-change-org-2016/,2016 was the year everyday Australian women took the power back.,"December 26, 2016","We are hearing a lot about how 2016 was a “bad” year, especially for women. And it’s exhausting. We have to remind ourselves of the good things that have happened, alongside the “I-never-could-imagine” and “for-all-the-progress-we’ve-made”. A friend of mine is having a baby. Another got engaged. A friend at work got a well-deserved promotion. There have been other victories, too — bigger than my social circle. Women in Australia have caused real change this year. Positive change. In 2016, women were responsible for eight of the 10 biggest social change victories of 2016 on Change.org — a website where everyday people can start a petition for change. These women have changed federal laws and influenced huge supermarket chains. They’ve fought to decriminalise medicinal cannabis; raised $500 million in relief for dairy farmers; and saved 26 lives by cutting the waiting list for a life-saving cancer operation. Below is a list of the nine biggest ""victories"" of women change-makers on Change.org from 2016. A ""victory"" is when the decision maker grants the ask of a petitioner. The petitions from the women below attracted more than 10,000 signatures, and resulted in real, tangible, positive change.  See? 2016 wasn't all bad. ""After a three year battle, first started on behalf of their terminally ill son Dan, Tamworth couple Lucy Haslam, a former nurse, and Lou Haslam, a former drugs squad police officer, changed the federal law in February 2016, to decriminalise medicinal cannabis,"" Gary Nunn, the Communications Director from Change.org, told Mamamia. ""It’s the second biggest win in the history of Change.org in Australia, with 251,000 on their petition and official responses below it from all major parties."" ""A 16-year-old schoolgirl persuaded the Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce to review the milk pricing system and offer a $500m relief package for battling dairy farmers like her dad,"" Nunn said. ""Chloe became the ‘face’ of the campaign to tackle the dairy crisis and met with senior MPs. Mr Joyce personally called Chloe and issued official responses on her petition, granting her ask and recognising her campaigning efforts."" ""Nicole spoke for many when she expressed her dismay at the manslaughter conviction for domestic violence perpetrator Gerard Baden-Clay,"" Nunn said. Baden-Clay was convicted for murdering his wife by a Queensland jury in 2014, but the state's Court of Appeal downgraded this to manslaughter in December last year. In August, 2016, the High Court reinstated his conviction to murder. ""[Nicole's] petition became a place where the public could express their desire for justice for Allison,"" Nunn said. ""Fitness instructor and mum of six, Galy was on death row for a perfectly curable cancer – because NSW Government refused to fund extra surgery places for the life-saving op she urgently needed,"" Nunn said. ""Galy would’ve died on the waiting list unless it was cut. Her successful campaign saved 25 lives before Christmas, and resulted in Mike Baird calling her personally to promise she’d be operated on before it’s too late."" ""16-year-old Angelina’s successful ask that supermarket giant Aldi stop stocking caged eggs began as a school project,"" Nunn explained. ""When her teacher suggested it become a petition, things took off: Billboards outside Aldi; customers being shown life for chickens in cages; and, ultimately, Aldi agreeing to go cage-free."" According to Georgia's petitions, Survival Island 3 - Australia Story 3D was a game available on a number of App stores that encourages players to fight and kill Aboriginals to survive. ""The game shamelessly promotes the fact that you will “have to fight with aboriginals” and uses warning messages like, “Beware of Aborigines!” when Indigenous people appear on screen. The game portrays Indigenous Australian’s as violent and aggressive,"" the Change.org petition reads. ""The App Stores that sold this app and its developers should be held accountable for not only promoting racism but profiting off it."" Nunn explained, ""When Georgia discovered a computer game encouraging the killing of Indigenous Australians, she targeted Amazon, who removed it within 24 hours of her petition being started."" ""When Aboriginal woman Lynette Daley was allegedly violently raped and murdered and left to die on a beach, two prime suspects escaped prosecution,"" Nunn told Mamamia.  ""Carolyn’s petition successfully persuaded the Department of Prosecutions to charge and prosecute the two men suspected of killing her."" Two men have been charged over the death of Lynette Daley at Ten Mile Beach in northern New South Wales in January 2011. Ms Daley, 33, was on a camping trip with her boyfriend, Adrian Attwater, and his friend, Paul Maris, in January 2011. Her body was found bruised and bloody on the beach, and an autospy revealed she had died from blunt force genital tract trauma. Both Attwater and Maris were charged, and the coroner referred the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions, but neither of the men were prosecuted. In June this year, charges were again made for manslaughter and aggravated sexual assault, as well as accessory after the fact to manslaughter and aggravated sexual assault. The petition came following a suggestion in the Federal Governments Driving Innovation, Fairness and Excellence discussion paper, according to the post on Change.org. The petition explained that ex-students would be forced to make contributions to their university Help Eligible Commonwealth Supported (HECS) loan before reaching the current threshold of $54,000 per year, if they lived in a high-income earning family. ""How is this fair? You do not require an income to take out a HECS help loan to complete your education,"" the petition reads. ""Monique successfully campaigned for the Government to abolish its plans to make HECS repayments means tested, highlighting the lack of fairness in the plans,"" Nunn said. Two doctors, Dr Biswajit “Jit” Banik and his wife, Dr Sarmin Sayeed (both internationally qualified medical practitioners), who arrived in Australia in 2007, faced potential deportation just because their son, aged three, was diagnosed with autism. ""Despite their extraordinary personal and academic achievements and contributions to the Australian community over the last nine years, the Australian Government has decided that Sarmin and Jit’s value and personal efforts do not outweigh the ‘burden’ of accepting their child, Arkojeet aged 12, who has mild autism,"" the petition reads. The petition was conducted as the couple were appealing the rejection they'd received following their applications for permanent residency, the petition explained. ""Following this petition, they were allowed to stay"" Nunn said. Some great stuff showing the power of compassion and determination.

The family of Belgian backpacker Theo Hayez is confident a hat found in bushland in Byron Bay belongs to him. Volunteers searching for Hayez discovered a distinctive grey Puma hat more than five weeks after he vanished on a night out on May 31. Police are yet to release the results of DNA tests on the cap, but a Facebook post on the Looking for Theo Hayez Facebook page on Saturday confirmed the family strongly believed it was Theo’s. “Over the past months, many of you have been wondering about the results of the DNA testing of the hat found in bushland off Tallows Beach on July 7th,” the post read. “Although no DNA results have been released publicly and may not be for some time, the family is certain that it is Théo’s hat. “The hat found was the exact same model and colour (grey, not black), shows the same wear and tear on the brim, and the position precisely matches one of his last known GPS locations.”    Police announced last month Hayez’s disappearance had been referred to the NSW coroner His family celebrated his 19th birthday on September 29, without knowing what happened to him. Theo has not been seen since May 31, when he left Byron Bay’s Cheeky Monkey’s nightclub. His phone last ‘pinged’ near Cape Byron Lighthouse on June 1. He was reported missing on June 6 when he failed to check out of his hostel, leaving his belongings and passport still in his room. Protesters lay on tram tracks at Bourke Street Mall before being moved on by Police. #ExtinctionRebellion #9News pic.twitter.com/IimAcSxdb6 — Nine News Melbourne (@9NewsMelb) October 11, 2019  Hundreds of thousands of dollars will be spent on overtime for police officers who worked during week-long climate change protests in Melbourne. Victoria Police Commander Tim Hansen said on Sunday the force was still totalling the cost of the Extinction Rebellion protests in the city, but overtime was already high. “The overtime budget is in the hundreds of thousands already… 16,000 patrol hours have been deployed,” he told reporters on Sunday, adding that 111 people had been arrested. “It has had a huge impact on our resourcing out in the regions and out in the suburbs.” Commander Hansen slammed the organisers for keeping police in the dark about their movements during the “spring rebellion”, which meant officers had to be taken off other duties. The commander ruled out making the protesters pay for the costs incurred during their activities, as that would only be applicable if there is a “level of commerciality”. “This is clearly a public community protest in public space. We are resourced and financed to deploy in those circumstances,” he said. The Extinction Rebellion movement held protests from Monday to Sunday including marches and other protests aimed at blocking traffic across the country. Among its requests, the movement called on governments to “tell the truth” about climate change by declaring a climate and ecological emergency. The moment that won it for the Silver Ferns.

Australia have blown a five-goal lead to lose 53-52 to the Silver Ferns in the first Test of netball’s Constellation Cup in Christchurch. A dominant third quarter on Sunday put the Diamonds ahead 44-39 but a series of errors quickly evaporated their advantage. The match was the first between the teams since July’s World Cup final in England where the Silver Ferns upset the Diamonds 52-51. Diamonds coach Lisa Alexander said it was frustrating to watch her team’s lack of attention to detail in the crunch moments. “I think we went away from some areas of our game plan that we had made a commitment to do. “And got a little bit sucked in to the environment that was going on around us and that will be a learning, particularly for the new players, that they can’t let that distract them,” Alexander said. The final quarter steadily worsened for Australia, who also lost goal shooter Caitlin Bassett. She left the court in discomfort and was replaced by Caitlin Thwaites. Bassett was one of Australia’s best, shooting 26/30 before leaving the game. The four-Test series will move to Auckland on Wednesday and Alexander said her captain would be “cherry ripe” for game two. The Diamonds found themselves down 26-25 at halftime after a poor opening half in which they were unable to capitalise on turnover ball. Australia, who hold the Constellation Cup, were particularly wasteful in the attacking third as their connections from the mid-court to the shooting circle were rusty. Alexander brought Laura Scherian on for her Test debut late in the second quarter and she was more efficient when feeding the shooting circle. “She’s just reminded us about how accurate she is with her feeding and the work that she does. She’s enormous in there. It was terrific to see her out there,” Alexander said. But that fluidity went out of the Diamonds’ attack in the final quarter and the Silver Ferns regained the lead with seven minutes to go and never gave it back. After Auckland, the series heads to Australia for Tests in Sydney and Perth. Nearly 8000 South Australians are going hungry each month, as a new report reveals the number of people seeking food handouts has grown by 15 per cent this year. More than 130,000 people in SA are seeking food relief each month, compared with 117,260 people last year. Of those people, it has been revealed that more than 7876 people are unable to be fed by charities. The report, released by Foodbank SA, confirmed the “very sad fact” that food demand could not be met in the state, chief executive Greg Pattinson said. “Despite our best efforts, we still can’t get to the parts of the state that really need our help, either due to the high cost of transport, logistics or that we just can’t get enough food…” he said. The report also found that women are 50 per cent more likely to go hungry than men. Mr Pattinson said the state government needs to do more to address the problem. “There shouldn’t be more than 7000 South Australians every month worrying about where they are going to get their next meal,” he said. Foodbank runs five food hubs across SA, as well as a mobile food van for remote communities. The Foodbank Hunger Report surveys 2,000 charities from around the country. An extra 30 children with epilepsy will be able to take medicinal cannabis as the state government expands its scheme to help more lives. https://t.co/8U1Wwcdg6O — SBS News (@SBSNews) October 13, 2019  A Victorian teenager who spent the past seven years battling up to 50 epileptic seizures a day hasn’t had any episodes since taking medical cannabis. Madison Williamson, 15, has been taking medical cannabis as part of her treatment for epilepsy for the past 10 months and hasn’t had a seizure since, her mum says. “Over the years the seizures changed. She ended up having cluster seizure where they could be up to 50 a day,” Amanda told reporters in Melbourne on Sunday. “Within two months, I realised that there were no boxes ticked for seizures. There’s been nothing since to this day. Everything has changed.” Madison has become the poster girl for the state government’s decision to expand its scheme for children with intractable epilepsy to use medical cannabis from 60 to 90. “We are going to expand the program to 90 children so that more children have the same opportunities to fully participate in society, to see a reduction in their seizures,” Health Minister Jenny Mikakos announced, adding it would cost $3.7 million annually. Ten children will be immediately added to the scheme, with the extra 20 young people to start on the scheme next year. Canadian pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol is used in the scheme. Royal Children’s Hospital paediatric neurologist Jeremy Freeman said many patients, aged from infants to 18, benefited from using the product with their other medication. “For the patients that have a good response, the change is pretty dramatic and fairly quick,” he said. “About half the patients we’ve treated have had significant reduction in their seizures and two-thirds of those are major reduction (less than half the normal amount of seizures), about a third of those have had about a minor reduction.” The hospital has about 30 children on its waitlist for the scheme, which has also been rolled out at Monash Health and the Austin Hospital. Ms Mikakos wants the federal government to add the medication it to the PBS. The federal government last month announced $3 million for clinical trials looking at how cannabis can be used to help treat cancer pain and other side effects. Opposition leader Michael O’Brien said more work needed to be done to find out if it is as effective as it can be before it goes on the PBS. “(But) if it is going to be effective in helping young people get through very difficult medical problems, I wouldn’t have a problem with it being added to the PBS,” he said.

https://www.mamamia.com.au/cannabis-oil-australia-lindsay-carter/,Lindsay has epilepsy and an inoperable brain tumour. Cannabis is the only thing that helps.,"April 13, 2021","Lanai Carter has had to grieve the days where if her son ran out of cannabis, they'd simply drive down to the local dispensary and pick some more up. Or they'd put in a phone call knowing it would be delivered to their doorstep in just four hours.  That was only the reality for a year of Lindsay Carter's journey with intractable epilepsy and an inoperable brain tumour. When the 22-year-old first got diagnosed at the age of 14, he and his family found themselves in America searching for answers. Cannabis oil and cannabis flower were the only things that helped, and thankfully over there, he could get access to both legally.  Watch: Lindsay and his mum on 60 Minutes in 2016. Post continues after video. Without it, Lindsay wouldn't eat. He was constantly nauseous, and he'd vomit all the time. He would get up to 20 seizures a day. On cannabis - which he is supposed to take in oil form three times a day, alongside vaporised cannabis which he uses throughout the day - he is a completely different person.  ""He went from barely being able to write on a birthday card to being able to write essays again,"" Lanai told Mamamia. ""From being a kid who barely went to school, to a kid bounding out the door full of energy wanting to live life to the fullest. It was just a complete turnaround."" But yo yo'ing between America and Australia every three months to top up their visa wasn't sustainable. After spending their life savings helping their son, the Carter family were forced to come home to Brisbane in late 2014.  Lanai was terrified. ""It was really hard to come back because it was this horrible feeling of being in a country where my son can’t get what he needs in any legal way. I remember us even looking at moving to another country as a family. I felt like that for so long - like I just needed to get him out of here,"" she said. But the family didn't have many choices. They'd spent all their money, and they needed to make Australia work. So they started lobbying the government, both state and federal, begging for access to the drugs - considered illicit here - that saved their son.  ""It felt like a necessity. We had multiple doctors saying he needed this medicine to keep him alive. That was the stage we were at....and we weren’t prepared to watch our son die. We didn’t want him to suffer brain damage from all the seizures he would have."" It took a year but eventually in 2015, Lindsay was the first in the country to be granted special permission to import cannabis into Australia, a year before it became legal here for medicinal use in exceptional circumstances.  But since then he's cycled through eight different companies after various interruptions to supply. As the New York Times reported in 2018, ""Even Australia's Medical Marijuana Poster Boy Can't Get The Drug."" ""First, we were experiencing lots of import issues, then changes to regulations that impacted supply and then companies would get bought out or taken over. Or they'd stop growing the strain [Lindsay needed]. It became one nightmare after another... we’d find a new product, and then that company would fall through,"" said Lanai.  Next to accessibility, affordability is the other enormous problem. Thankfully, companies like Australian Natural Therapeutic Group (ANTG) have been able to help Lindsay via a compassionate care program. Without their help, Lanai says they'd be looking at up to $90,000 per year securing medicine for Lindsay. They still end up forking out hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars a month depending on the supply blockage they are facing at the time.  ""The difficulty in acquiring commercial licencing has led to a saturation of the Australia medicinal cannabis market from countries such as Canada, where companies are not required to meet the same level of restrictions placed on Australian businesses,"" said ANTG CEO Matt Cantelo.  ""It’s imported at a premium price. Many patients in Australia are unable to afford the ongoing costs of imported medicinal cannabis,"" he told Mamamia. Matt's NSW based facility was recently granted a license to produce large quantities of medicinal cannabis oil for commercial use - a move which will mean more affordable access for Australian patients. They're hopeful they'll have four new varieties of Australian medicinal grade cannabis oils available in the market within the next few months. But as the Carters know all too well, right now the demand is far greater than the current supply, and it means someone always misses out. Right now that's Lindsay, who needs a very particular type of cannabis oil that's not currently available.  Thankfully, this week he finally got access to more flower product, but his mum says without the oil he will end up in hospital again. Access to medicinal cannabis is granted by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, and in 2020 the number of approvals was up around the 100,000 mark. In March 2021 alone, there were 8000 approvals.  ""The government needs to step up and make sure the measures they are taking have that foresight into the future so there's always an adequate supply [of cannabis for medicinal use]. There also needs to be more funding options. Patients can’t be left in this situation where they can’t afford their medicine so they just suffer. But it just feels like there’s a long time between now and when there’s actually going to be suitable solutions,"" Lanai told Mamamia.  Without consistent access to suitable oils, Lindsay is unable to work and has had to give up on studying cybersecurity - which he was loving. ""He would have had a very bright future ahead of him if he’d been able to complete that qualification but there were interruptions to his medicine again and he ended up in hospital after having five tonic-clonic seizures (a seizure that involves a loss of consciousness and violent muscle contractions) in 24 hours,"" she said. ""He just wants to be normal young man. He doesn’t want to be talking about this. He wants to get on with his life. The same for all of us, we want to get on with our lives. It’s certainly not something we want to be worrying about in years to come."" Feature image: Supplied/Gary Mills Photography.","Apr 13, 2021 ...

https://www.mamamia.com.au/mums-and-marijuana/,"""Hey mums, it's time to put down the wine and pick up a bong.""","March 3, 2016","At first I loved the idea of pot-smoking mums. Groups of women who say taking a hit from a bong before reading their children bedtime stories makes for a much better experience for all. Then I fast-forwarded to thoughts of the morning after – the fruit roll up wrappers strewn across the kitchen bench and all the ice-cream eaten. Then I thought maybe it isn’t such a good idea after all. Sure, these kids are getting a happy and relaxed mum who is thrilled to read the same bedtime story three times, complete with funny voices. however these children will eventually be deprived of all of their favourite snack foods because after the high comes the munchies. And nothing satisfies the munchies more than children’s snack foods. I’m talking fruit roll ups, cheese snacks, crunchy crackers and tiny teddies. All the snacks. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. So I’m reluctant, despite testimonials from women such as The Moms of Marijuana, a group of women in Beverly Hills in the US who have access to medical marijuana and say it makes them better mothers. FYI, medical marijuana is legal in some parts of the US however isn’t yet legal in Australia. Wine is legal. But we can live in hope. January Jones is a Beverly Hills mum who proudly takes a hit from a bong before bedtime. Ms Jones started using marijuana due to early onset arthritis and noticed many other benefits, telling Barcroft TV, “Smoking cannabis helps me be a better mother. It makes me a more creative mum, a more relaxed mother.” She also reads her two-year-old daughter a book about cannabis use called, It’s Just a Plant because, education people. “Marijuana is for grown-ups,” said Jackie’s mum. “Some things are for adults and not for children, like driving a car or drinking a coffee.” Suddenly, Jackie stopped to sniff the air. “I know that smell!” she said… In Australia a mother’s preferred method of relaxation is usually wine, or in my case, a cup of tea and a mint slice biscuit (because I don’t drink, don’t judge). True, my night-time relaxation ritual doesn’t improve my performance as a mother because I can’t truly enjoy it until the kids are in bed. Every extra request they have between their bedtime story and actual bedtime fills me with resentment. Mummy needs her tea and mint slice biscuit. Please go to sleep, now! Where as if I went outside and took a hit from “Mummy’s special helper” I’d be so chill that their requests would be met with lazy smiles, sleepy nods and my own requests for them to bring me more packets of sweet and salty popcorn from the kitchen. My kids won’t know what hit ’em. “Marijuana mum” January Jones spoke to Barcroft TV about her use of medicinal cannabis and the affect it has on her parenting. Post continues after this video… They might be a bit scared, actually. I can imagine them saying, “Mum, why are you so happy,” and looking at me with suspicious little faces. Which is the moment I would choose to pull out my own copy of It’s Just a Plant and read it to them, followed by several Dr. Seuss books and then maybe a bit of a go at Where’s Wally? “You can’t hide from me today you little bugger,” I’d say as I sent my daughter to get me another bag of sweet and salty popcorn out of the cupboard before falling asleep on the floor and waking up a few hours later, only to find the kids in the living room playing on the X-Box. At 1am. Obviously I could do it better than this. There are so many YouTube videos available showing mothers who use cannabis in a variety of interesting ways, including hosting dinner parties using it as an ingredient and a garnish. Why don’t I have friends like that? I just have silly friends and their paellas and their fancy coffee machines… Smoking is safer than a drunk mum There can't be two January Jones... surely this woman has named herself after the actress?","Mar 3, 2016 ...

When Australian dad Adam Koessler gave his tiny daughter medicinal cannabis oil, it was a desperate attempt to ease her suffering. A small part of him was probably hoping it would save her life. Rumer Rose is just two and has stage 4 neuroblastoma which attacks her nerve tissue. It’s in its final stages. Watching his bed-ridden daughter suffer day in and day out has been excruciating for him. He’s a father. He’s meant to protect his daughter from pain and suffering. Instead Rumer Rose is lying in a hospital bed slowly and painfully dying. After finding out about the effectiveness of cannabis oil on cancer patients he bought some, mixed it with coconut and gave it to her. He says the improvement was immediate. He told the Newcastle Herald, ""She would say ‘Daddy, tummy’s not sore’ and she would be able to eat like a champion and began to gain weight. Her energy was up and she wanted to go outside with me instead of lay on her back with her legs curled up. Her skin colour came back, her eyes were sparkling again and we just looked at each other in complete amazement."" Adam - who is separated from Rumer's mother - traveled to Brisbane with his daughter so she could have further treatment and was arrested and charged with supplying a dangerous drug to a person under 16 and for possessing a prohibited drug. He was released on bail on the condition  that he not have contact with his dying daughter. The devastated dad sought permission from the court to visit his her and was granted supervised visitation, however was turned away by her mother and hospital security staff. He is due to appear in court next Tuesday. Nearly 50,000 people have signed a petition calling on politicians to allow him to be with his daughter. They have remained spectacularly silent thus far and the lack of compassion being shown is mind-blowing. Adam is being supported by a further 30,000 people on Facebook and thousands of dollars has been raised to fund her treatment and her dad's legal fight. The petition calls on Queensland premier Campbell Newman to intervene. It states: It is inhumane and unjust to keep a parent, who acted out of love for his child [and] wanting to prolong her life, away from her during such severe illness. Medical cannabis has been legalised in many countries and jurisdictions around the globe. There is ample evidence to show that it has many beneficial effects for cancer patients without the harmful side effects and other associated risks of current drug treatments. In fact working in conjunction with the recommended treatment regime, medical cannabis has also been proven to alleviate these adverse side effects. Rumer Rose is now in intensive care and her condition is deteriorating but it may not be enough to reunite this father and daughter in time.

https://www.mamamia.com.au/cannabis-oil-australia-trial/,'Some are alarmed my 12yo is in a medical cannabis trial. But life is difficult enough.',"May 16, 2019","We celebrate when my 12-year-old daughter Rebecca puts her school uniform on without refusing, when she doesn’t swear at her teachers or peers, and doesn’t lift up her dress to seek attention. A good day is when Rebecca doesn’t throw herself on the ground in a tantrum or say she won’t go to her weekly after school therapy sessions. Most mornings, I feel like I have run a marathon before we get out the door. Rebecca is more than a handful and that is okay, I love my daughter, she is my shining light. I’ve learnt to adjust my barometer of what’s ‘normal’. Rebecca has a rare genetic condition called FOXP1 Syndrome which is neurodevelopmental and behavioural in nature. It took us nine years before doctors confirmed Rebecca’s diagnosis. No parent should have to wait that long or longer, when we have genome sequencing testing which yields a 30-50 per cent diagnosis rate. The trouble is, the test is not funded by Medicare. Rare conditions are difficult to diagnose because for that exact reason, they are rare. Rebecca was the 13th person diagnosed worldwide with FOXP1 Syndrome. Now we estimate there are 100 because genomic sequencing testing makes it easier for a geneticist to pinpoint the disease-causing gene variant. Symptoms include: dysmorphic features, global development delay, intellectual disability, issues with speech, poor fine and gross motor skills, impulsiveness, low muscle tone, autistic like features, anxiety, ADHD, obsessive compulsive traits, sensory reactivity symptoms and other significant behavioural problems. Rebecca takes longer to learn things because of her cognitive ability and she has difficulty controlling her emotions which can lead to some pretty extreme behavioural issues and safety concerns. I can cope with the intellectual disability and the language issues, but the behaviour is the hardest thing to deal with. This is why we are taking part in a pilot trial to determine if medical cannabis can help curb her extreme behaviour. The Murdoch Children’s Research Institute (MCRI) trial uses medical cannabis produced by Tilray, a global leader in the field. It is a pilot study to see if it is possible to run a large scale in the future. The 2012 ABS data shows that four percent of children aged 0-14 have an intellectual disability. It is unknown exactly how many of these children have behavioural issues as well, but I imagine it would be quite a few. There is very little research into suitable treatment plans and medication to help our children and support the families to cope with what can sometimes be extreme behavioural concerns. I’m hopeful medical cannabis will prove to be an effective therapeutic treatment, where other medication has failed. As Rebecca’s behaviour escalates, we continue to increase the quantity of Fluoxetine which is a Prozac and is used to treat depression and OCD. Like most commercial anti-depressants it comes with unwanted side effects such as sleep difficulties and anxiety. Some people may be supportive of medical cannabis while others may be concerned and alarmed that I would allow my daughter to participate in this trial. I believe in supporting research that has the capacity to lead to better treatment plans for people like my Rebecca. Life is difficult enough when you have a child with a rare disease so why wouldn’t I support a clinical research trial that could help her. I think there is just so much misinformation and lack of can close some people’s minds to this treatment. A cannabis plant produces between 80 and 100 cannabinoid chemicals. The two main cannabinoids with therapeutic benefits are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC has strong psychoactive effects, meaning it makes a person ‘high’, whereas CBD has no psychoactive effects. Only CBD which has the therapeutic benefit is being given to children taking part in this trial. MCRI’s study has seen ten children undergo a 74-day course of CBD in the form of oral peppermint-flavoured liquid. Half of the trial participants received CBD, the other the placebo. We hope that the results from this trial pave the way for a larger research study. Rebecca's diagnosis inspired her mum Heather to set up Syndromes Without A Name (SWAN) Australia, a not for profit charity which provides information and support to families who care for a child with an undiagnosed or rare genetic condition. Good. It's about time people in this country had access to medicine that could help them manage their medical conditions. First step towards accessing new medicines is to prove said new medicines actually work and are safe to use. Hence, clinical trials. Cannabis has been used for thousands of years, both medically and recreationally. It seems to be an effective medicine for quite a few different medical conditions. It's also quite safe, no-one has ever died from a cannabis overdose, although they might have raided the servo for chips and soft drink. Uh, no. It's not good enough to say it ""seems to be effective"" - you need high-level scientific proof that it *is* effective. Having a feeling that something might work, based on nothing more than anecdotal evidence, is a primitive, low-level approach to modern medicine. The safety profile of medications - ascertained by trials - means ascertaining evaluating optimum dosing, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and any interactions a new drug has with other medications and physical states. This also addresses a drug's toxicity profile and how best to manage side effects. Again, all done in clinical trials. Lots of potentially harmful, but largely ineffective remedies have been ""used for thousands of years"". Historical habit is no substitute for scientific enquiry. You don't get to cut corners if you want to be intelligent and evidence-based in medicine. Since it’s already been approved in the states, it seems a bit ridiculous that we need to conduct our own set of clinical trials. Talk about duplication of effort.","May 16, 2019 ...

https://www.mamamia.com.au/physical-grief-symptoms/,Last month I lost my dad. There are 4 aspects of grief I didn't expect.,"April 3, 2022","When a parent dies, it’s so incredibly hard to comprehend that you will no longer create another memory with them. This is a person who taught you everything you know; someone who has been there at every major life event.  No matter how much warning you receive that they’re going to die, it still hits like a tonne of bricks when it actually happens. Even if you actually see them die in front of you, you’re still likely going to be shocked by the fact you can no longer cuddle them or share further memories.  Watch: Robin Bailey on losing her dad at a young age. Post continues below. My dad, Peter Brian Hudson, was a remarkable person, husband, father, grandfather, professor and musician.  But boy, was he unlucky. Seriously, someone would’ve had a better chance at winning the lotto twice than going through what my dad endured.  In 2017, Dad was diagnosed with a stage 4 prostate cancer that was incredibly rare; only 47 cases recorded in the world. No one had lived past five years.  He had been complaining about back pain for years, but his PSA readings had continually come back as normal. Further examinations showed he had a deadly cancer, adenosquamous carcinoma of the prostate, but it’d already breached the organ. It was likely in his blood.  Surgery. Radiation. Chemo. Hormone therapy. More radiation. Chemo. Steroids. Surgery.  It was exhausting, but mostly he did it with a smile on his face, wearing comically colourful socks, ensuring it wouldn’t get us down. His positivity gave us hope that maybe, just maybe, we’d find a cure. Or perhaps even a miracle would occur? We’d read about other people’s miracles, so why couldn’t our dad have one?  It was a rocky road, with cancer popping up in various areas, but he was defying the odds of his predicted life expectancy. He even got to meet two of his adoring grandchildren, my two boys, who kept him very occupied.   Medicinal cannabis helped dad through pain and insomnia.  During this time, he even recorded four albums, which are now on Spotify. A self-taught artist, the songs are all written, played and recorded by my dad in his home studio.   In his previous academic “Professor” life, he wrote and published hundreds of research articles.  I thought perhaps he’d go on to do so much more.  But then, the unthinkable happened.  Dad had been in a small car crash. He was confused and disoriented.  Mum decided to take him to the hospital for a CT scan.  I will never forget the day. December 28, I was playing cricket in our backyard with my family when my dear mum called me.  “It’s a brain tumour,” she cried.  Low and behold - another rare, primary stage 4 cancer, but even deadlier than the first. An enormous butterfly glioblastoma. The ‘butterfly’ aspect means it’s covering both sides of the brain, making it even harder to treat.  How could one amazing man be so unlucky? He wanted to live more than anyone I knew. He still had so much more to offer.  From then on, every day was a struggle for Dad, however, when I came over to their house every second day with my two little boys, he’d muscle up every bit of energy he had to play with them. Even swim in the pool at times.  We often spent time laying on his bed, cuddling him and showering him with love.  He could barely walk or see out his right eye, yet my dad would do everything humanly possible to have more special moments with my boys. Being “Poppa” was one of his favourite roles.  Grandparent photo taken just days after dad was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Image: Supplied.  Words can’t fully describe how wonderful, exhilarating and beautiful this man truly was - he exuded an excitement for life like no other.  Dad had a seizure while I was cuddling him. He had only just finished reading a book to my boys. Two days later, he died in hospital with my mum, brother, sister and me by his side. We knew he was dying, yet when he died, we still couldn’t comprehend that we’d never see him again. Why were we still so shocked?  Image: Supplied.  We hadn’t seen anyone outside our immediate family in months, but it was a small sacrifice to make - none of us wanted to ‘be the person’ who gave dad COVID-19 and potentially fast-tracked his death. I worked from home and my kids didn’t go to childcare.  That day when we came back from the hospital, one person down, now just the four of us, we invited some family over to help ease the pain.  This is my first real experience with grief and for those who may go through it for the first time as well, here’s what I have learned so far:  Sometimes, you may feel fine, particularly when you’re distracted. Other times, it will make you sick to your stomach. Someone may ask a simple question like “how are you?” and it could very well set you off.  Grief can control your entire body, from feeling physically sick to being exhausted all the time. Strange things may start to happen to your body – for me, I get bouts of nausea and have tinnitus from stress. People are so kind and want to help, but no one is going to be able to make the pain go away. I feel robbed of time, like many do when they lose a loved one. People say lines like “I know how you feel”, or “It’s not as bad as....” Try to understand that these sentences have good intentions; they come from empathy and not knowing what to say.  My dad was not a religious man, and neither am I, so what I’ve been grappling with is “an eternity of nothingness” for him - the man who I knew as being full of life.  The scientist in him knew that energy can’t be destroyed – humans have energy and therefore, his energy will be around us. I take comfort in that.  Technology also makes it easier for us to remember those who pass. My little boys, who are one and three years old, watch the dozens of videos we recorded of their “Poppa” and talk to him – none the wiser that he is no longer physically here.   100 years will go by – will he be remembered?  Peter Brian Hudson was more grateful to be alive than anyone I knew. I know people die younger, but I still feel like I’ve been robbed of time. Since his death on March 1, I have listened to his albums – and wow – my dad has left us so many beautiful messages.  “Live your life your way” being one of the main messages to come out of one album. Dad lived every day like it was his last. He never took anything for granted. It was like he had more time, with the amount he crammed in his 65 years. Hundreds of people attended and watched dad’s funeral. Even an Italian man who sound mastered dad’s songs watched via Zoom – they hadn’t met, but he said he considered Dad a friend.  I will never know why my dad was dealt such s**tty cards – maybe it was so I could remind you all how precious and short life truly is?  From here on out, I’ve made a pact that I am going to make sure my dad is remembered passed 100 years, through my kids, and theirs ... because he deserves that.  “Every day is a gift and I can’t wait to see what it holds” – Peter Brian Hudson.

Essendon plane crash pilot was already under investigation, Fairfax can reveal https://t.co/jz5V3fJn4F pic.twitter.com/8IwG2fEgCk — The Age (@theage) February 21, 2017  Fairfax is reporting that the pilot of the plane that crashed at Essendon Airport yesterday, killing all five on board, was the subject of an ongoing investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. Max Quartermain, 63, was reportedly facing a possible suspension of his aviation licence over a mid-air near miss with another plane in September 2015. The Beechcraft B200 King Air Quartermain was flying came “within 1.8 kilometres horizontally and 90 metres vertically” to a plane travelling from Sydney. The pilot of the other plane claimed that if there was a mid-air collision between the two aircraft “18 people would have been killed”. Yesterday’s crash at Essendon Airport is Victoria’s worst civil aviation accident in 30 years. Witnesses say the plane, carrying pilot Quartermaine and four passengers, erupted into a “massive fireball” when it crashed into a DFO shopping centre just after 9:00am.

Aussie saves teens from frozen NYC pond https://t.co/QAa19DrlkJ — news.com.au (@newscomauHQ) February 21, 2017  Two male models have been hailed as heroes after they rushed to help a group of teenagers who fell through ice on a Central Park pond while taking selfies, news.com.au reports. Australian model Ethan Turnbull, 24, was skateboarding through the famous New York City park with his friend, fellow model Bennett Jonas, when he saw the teens struggling in the freezing cold water just before 6pm on Monday. “I look over, I saw six heads just trying to get to the shore,” Jonas told NBC News. “The back one was probably a good 20 yards from dry land.” Turnbull added that the last teen they rescued from the water was unconscious. The teens were taken to local hospitals with minor injuries, most of them hypothermia-related. Divers then entered the pond – believed to be around five metres deep in the middle – to ensure no one else was in the water. FDNY officials believe the group of boys – aged 15 and 16 – were “horsing around” on the thin ice of the off-limits pond before deciding to take a photograph of themselves.

The news comes after the federal parliament passed laws last year to legalise medicinal cannabis for use in Australia by patients suffering from painful and chronic illnesses, like HIV sufferers, those with severe epilepsy and cancer patients. Patients have previously been forced to import medicinal cannabis from overseas or turn to the black market for medications. Mr Hunt’s announcement means sick patients would no longer have to wait for treatment. “We have listened to the concerns of patients and their families that are having difficulty accessing the product while domestic production becomes available,” he told News Corp Australia. “We are now making it easier to access medicinal cannabis, while still maintaining strict safeguards for individual and community safety. As part of these changes, importers can source medicinal cannabis products from a reputable supplier overseas and store these in a safe, secure warehouse in Australia.” The growth and use of cannabis for recreational purposes is still illegal, with state-based criminal laws still in place. Parents arrested after 8-year-old son overdosed on heroin, police say https://t.co/sW1FdnJadG — Washington Post (@washingtonpost) February 21, 2017  A couple from Ohio have been arrested and charged with child endangerment after their eight-year-old son reportedly suffered a non-fatal overdose of heroin last month, the Washington Post reports. Police responded to a report of a child not breathing at a home on January 11. When they arrived at the scene, they found the child unresponsive and his father doing chest compressions. Officers suspected the parents – Charles Dowdy and Danielle Simko, both 31 – of narcotics use after finding drugs and syringes on their property. According to police reports, Dowdy originally said that he and his partner had been in bed with their son when they noticed his lips turning blue. “I think he was sleeping and I think what happened was he rolled over and I don’t think he could breathe,” Dowdy told dispatcher in the 911 call obtained by WKYC. “I think he was just, like, in the pillow and he suffocated.” According to cleveland.com, staff discovered prescription pills and a small bag of heroin in the child’s sock.

https://www.mamamia.com.au/one-nation-policies-from-wikipedia/,"Pauline Hanson: Text slabs from One Nation party policies lifted from internet, including Wikipedia.","July 11, 2016","By political reporter Dan Conifer Pauline Hanson’s One Nation Party has copied slabs of text from the internet for some of its policies — including from Wikipedia. Ms Hanson will this year return to Federal Parliament as a senator for Queensland after nearly two decades in the political wilderness. During the campaign, Ms Hanson called for a ban on Muslim immigration to Australia, a royal commission into Islam and a ban on new mosques. One Nation picked up nearly one in 10 Senate votes in Queensland. The party claims it could also win Senate seats in several other states. But chunks of the party’s policies on halal certification, sustainable development and medicinal cannabis have been copied off the internet. One part of One Nation’s policy on halal food — which links the religious blessing to terrorism financing — has been lifted from Frontpage Magazine — a right-wing American “battle tank, geared to fight a war” against the political left. Another section of the halal certification policy comes from the website of the Q Society — an anti-Islamic group which organised for controversial Dutch MP Geert Wilders to visit Australia in 2012. Part of One Nation's position on the Agenda 21 international sustainable development agreement is almost identical to a five-year-old pamphlet from US group The John Birch Society. A section of One Nation's medicinal cannabis plan is very similar to parts of a user-generated Wikipedia page on the subject. The Wikipedia entry reads: ""The ancient Egyptians used hemp (cannabis) in suppositories for relieving the pain of haemorrhoids.""  ""Surviving texts from ancient India confirm that cannabis' psychoactive properties were recognized, and doctors used it for treating a variety of illnesses and ailments, including insomnia, headaches, gastrointestinal disorders, and pain, including during childbirth,"" it says. The One Nation website reads: ""The ancient Egyptians used hemp (cannabis) in suppositories for relieving the pain of haemorrhoids … In ancient India, doctors used it for treating a variety of illnesses and ailments, including insomnia, headaches, gastrointestinal disorders, and pain, including during childbirth.""

It is pretty much standard practice these days with the internet. 1) To the person ""guest"" who thinks women are sheep and just follow other women I have news for you, we are thinking, intelligent humans who make our own minds up. Hanson is detrimental to the social fabric of society, for women, for men, for diversity, for intelligence, for sustainability, for social cohesion. Women don't support other women just because they are women - that is sexist and demeaning.2) I don't care about her education level, as mentioned there are plenty of university educated bigots, that are cunning and dominate public policy (Safe Schools, national curriculum, funding for low socio economic people). I am not elitist and I care more about the dangerous links Hanson has not whether she can articulate or develop her own policies. Although the author makes a reference to Wikipedia being her one of her sources I consider the other sites way more troublesome. Ill informed is one thing, down right hate sites are another.3) Why do so many men write on mm that obviously either show clear bias against women, have sexist views, or MRA agenda? I am curious why they are allowed to perpetuate stereotypes? Surely the email tree has been recognised and we can moderate them out of making demeaning comments? That is why we have moderation, right? Or is a site that says it targets women and mothers as an audience, obliged to contain women-hating bigotry? I have been on generally male dominated sites for technical things and I can tell you women are not there making sexist remarks against men! I agree with your first two points, but regarding your third I think it's a good idea that these sexist men have their say (unless it's downright hate speech and/or violent) - it's important that everyone be allowed to share their view, and hopefully be educated by the replies that will no doubt follow it. Most likely they'll be keyboard warriors who ignore or fight back against any feedback, but others may learn better. I am not against opinions. I am against organised campaigns to detract, dictate debates. I enjoy sharing of information and I have noticed a distinct anti women sentiment. Most men don't have this opinion so it is coming directly from the email trees that operate to hijack genuine opinions. Sometimes I comment because I firmly believe in something.Sometimes it's because I see someone say something stupid and I want to fight back against it.Sometimes people will make blindingly awful arguments and I will comment so that they have to defend their position.Going back to your original comment (part 3), I could certainly argue that even though this is a feminist website it should be obliged to cut out any man hating bigotry, as well as not be perpetuating stereotypes. It's most obvious in a lot of the domestic violence articles. The stereotype is women are victims, men are perpetrators. Fully 1/3 of all victims are ignored, simply because they are men. 1) totally agree with you. I think your issue is with women who say things like there is a special place in hell for women who don't support other women in politics (re Clinton). Or, closer to home, write a response to Tanya Plibs MM piece http://www.mamamia.com.au/w... 2) totally agree with you. 3) ask the men why they comment, but be aware if you are new here a few regulars get instantly aggressive about men commenting.

About a dozen homes were damaged or destroyed in fires on Tuesday, as parts of the state endured a “catastrophic” fire danger. NSW remains in a state of emergency, with high temperatures, strong winds and very low humidity causing treacherous conditions for some 1500 firefighters battling blazes. At 5:30am, 73 fires are burning across the state, 37 yet to be contained. Two fires are at Emergency Warning. Residents near active fires need to be aware of the potential for fire activity to increase under stronger winds today and a statewide Total Fire Ban is in place. #NSWRFS pic.twitter.com/5ZkBoOCWuh — NSW RFS (@NSWRFS) November 12, 2019 
More than a million hectares of land has been consumed by bushfires, and authorities dealt with 300 new blazes on Tuesday alone. The southerly wind change brought lower temperatures, but Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said NSW once again faced hot, dry and windy conditions predicted on Friday and over the weekend. He warned the challenge ahead remains “enormous”. “All these fires… are still subject to the influence of this strong southerly change that’s moving across the fireground which will impact and influence fire behaviour, create volatile and potentially dangerous circumstances,” Mr Fitzsimmons told reporters in Sydney on Tuesday evening. “The enormity of the task to bring these fires properly under control, to consolidate them, to get around them and mop them up is enormous.” He said there was still “a really long way to go”. A number of firefighters were injured, but none are in a critical condition, and there were no people missing as of Tuesday night, he said. Injuries to firefighters throughout the day included fractures, heat exhaustion, fainting and collapse. The bushfires, which hit hard on Friday, have claimed three lives and destroyed another 12 homes overnight, bringing the total number of properties destroyed to about 160, the Nine Network reported on Wednesday. While conditions are expected to ease on Wednesday, Mr Fitzsimmons said a forecast for severe weather into the weekend and another burst of hot air next week means “we simply aren’t going to get the upper hand on all of these fires”. “Unfortunately there’s no meaningful reprieve. There’s no rainfall in this change and we’re going to continue to have warm dry conditions dominating in the days and weeks ahead,” he said, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. “It’s going to be a long, difficult fire season and we have the worst of our conditions typically ahead of us as we come into the months of summer.” A statewide total fire ban remains in place. Bureau of Meteorology state manager Ann Farrell said as the southerly change moves up NSW “the fires will be fanned in a different direction”. A week-long state of emergency has been declared in NSW with the armed forces standing by to provide support, including for search and rescue operations. Some 600 schools were closed although most are expected to reopen, apart from about 140 state schools – mainly in the north. .@nswpolice has taken action against three men for allegedly breaching a state-wide fire ban as well as a nine-year-old boy who has been accused of committing an act of arson. #NSWfires #7NEWS https://t.co/XYytsEEp3L — 7NEWS Australia (@7NewsAustralia) November 12, 2019  Three men have allegedly breached NSW’s total fire ban while a nine-year-old boy has admitted to lighting a fire with a blowtorch as blazes rage throughout the state, according to NSW Police. Police allege the first incident saw a 27-year-old man light a small campfire at Wallacia in Sydney’s west on Monday afternoon to boil water for cups of tea. He immediately extinguished the flames when police and firefighters arrived, and was issued an on-the-spot $2,200 infringement notice. Hours later, police were called to a home at Prestons in Sydney’s south-west, where a 35-year-old man allegedly burned fence palings in a cylindrical barbecue. “Embers from this fire fell to the ground and ignited palings, causing a secondary blaze,” NSW Police said in a statement. Both fires were extinguished and the man was also issued an infringement notice. The third man will face court after he allegedly lit a small coal barbecue at a Lalor Park home in Sydney’s west in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Fire and Rescue NSW extinguished the fire and the 46-year-old man was arrested for failing to comply with a total fire ban and breach of bail. He’s due to appear in a local court on Tuesday. The nine-year-old, due to his age, was warned under the Young Offenders Act after a small grass fire broke out behind a street in Nowra on the South Coast about 11.35am on Tuesday. Police say the boy, who was with a group of other children, admitted to lighting the fire with a blowtorch. The total state-wide fire ban remains in place and has been extended into Wednesday. It means people cannot light, maintain or use a fire in the open, or carry out any activity in the open that causes, or is likely to cause, a fire. Mine site murder – the homicide squad head to the Pilbara where a father of three was found dead. A FIFO worker is in custody.https://t.co/iuw7S3koFo #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/0QaMKHngOf — 7NEWS Perth (@7NewsPerth) November 12, 2019  A FIFO worker has been charged over the death of a colleague at a mine site in Western Australia’s north. Police were called to Pilbara Minerals’ Pilgangoora lithium-tantalum project about 120km south of Port Hedland about 6.30am on Monday after the 40-year-old victim from Marble Bar was found deceased. Homicide Squad detectives questioned his 30-year-old co-worker, who is from the Perth suburb of Craigie, and charged him on Tuesday. The man will face South Hedland Magistrates Court on Wednesday. Pilbara Minerals issued a statement saying the “tragic incident … involved contractor personnel … and not direct employees”. “Pilbara Minerals will continue to provide full support to the Western Australia Police Force as their investigation progresses and is unable to provide any further comment,” it said. Managing director Ken Brinsden said on Monday he was extremely shocked and saddened by what had occurred, and offered condolences “to the affected people and their families”. The Australian stock exchange-listed company suspended work to facilitate the investigation and has now been cleared to resume operations. Pilbara Minerals says it expects to return to planned production rates within the next 24 to 48 hours. It curbed production and processing during the September quarter due to weak demand. In Yeppoon alone, eleven homes have been lost. Tomorrow, conditions are expected to get even worse, with hot temperatures and gusty winds on the way. https://t.co/g9riPivq6C @AmeliaAdam1 #qldfires #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/s9ixwcxoc4 — 7NEWS Wide Bay (@7NewsWideBay) November 12, 2019  Firefighters battling to contain a massive blaze in Central Queensland before conditions flare up again are hoping their preparations will hold. Fire authorities near Yeppoon are worried about rising temperatures and strengthening winds forecast for Wednesday. “We hope to undertake enough action today … so that tomorrow we have a better success of keeping the fire within the existing lines,” Rural Fire Service’s Inspector Wayne Kapernick said. The efforts of exhausted firefighters, who have been fighting a blaze burning near Cobraball, Bungundurra, Maryvale and Lake Mary for days, have been boosted with firies from elsewhere in the state. “It has been a long campaign (that is) taking a tremendous toll,” Inspector Kapernick said. At least 11 homes were destroyed in the blaze that by Monday was 30-kilometres long. About 65 per cent of the Cobraball fire was contained on Monday but firefighters were making slow progress on Tuesday, he said. “Given the dry conditions we’ve got a lot of work to do to make sure those edges are safe and hold up to tomorrow’s conditions with the increased wind strength so there’s no escape of embers,” he said. Queensland Fire and Emergency Services acting commissioner Mike Wassing said he was comfortable with the status of the state’s largest blazes but containment lines would be tested when the winds shift. Backburning operations at Cobraball have been stalled until winds drop, making it safe to continue. Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Dean Narramore said winds would pick up late on Tuesday and Wednesday morning with gusts up to 60km/h from late morning or early afternoon. Tuesday’s fire danger rating for the Darling Downs and Granite Belt and Southeast Coast is already severe and will remain so on Wednesday and also take in Wide Bay and Burnett. There is likely to be little reprieve on Thursday before temperatures and winds increase again from Friday throughout the weekend. West Aussie GPs are now able to prescribe medicinal cannabis, in a major shake-up of the state’s health system. The change comes into effect as of today. pic.twitter.com/U6f1xFAjxk — Nine News Perth (@9NewsPerth) November 11, 2019  Doctors in Western Australia can now prescribe medicinal cannabis without the need for a referral to a specialist. Allowing GPs to prescribe the medication for patients suffering conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and chronic pain, brings WA into line with other states including NSW, Queensland and Victoria. But doctors must still seek specialist approval when prescribing for children under the age of 16 and patients who are drug dependent or have a history of drug abuse. Medicinal cannabis products are not approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration or funded by the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme, which is the responsibility of the federal government. “It is important for the Commonwealth to have a flexible system that expedites affordable access to new and emerging healthcare treatments,” Health Minister Roger Cook said on Tuesday. Australian Medical Association WA president Andrew Miller backed the state government’s decision and said the potential for “doctor shopping” was low. He said medicinal cannabis had been shown to help children with epilepsy and patients with neurological conditions. “At this stage, the evidence for this use more widely for things such as nausea or for chronic pain is not very good at all,” he told reporters. “We already have quite good drugs for these things … so, we’ll need to collect a lot more data and see some proper trials coming forward from the drug companies before we’ll be supporting widespread use.” Half of NSW is burning, and still some idiots don't understand what a total fire ban means.

But, we’re also partial to cheering on an underdog. In 2015, impassioned Aussies attached their virtual signature to many a petition. These were six issues that really riled us up, according to online petition platform Change.org.  A small businessman from the Gold Coast, Klaus Bartosch, led a three-year campaign against exorbitant credit card surcharges being forced onto customers. “Credit card surcharges are gouging customers hundreds of millions of dollars every year,” he wrote in a change.org petition. “They’re being added to flights (Jetstar $8.50 per flight), paying bills (Telstra 2%+ GST), cab fares (10% of fare). They’re out of control – and it’s time they’re banned. “There have been too many excuses on this, for too many years.” His petition, which was signed by more than 90,000 others, led to 5,000 submissions calling for the surcharges to be banned in the Murray financial system inquiry. In October, the government said it would ban excessive surcharges on credit cards. Thanks for keeping them honest, Klaus. When a teenager loses a parent, an expected reaction might be for the child to withdraw or act out. But not Josie Pohla. Just one month after her mother took her own life, the 14-year-old began an online petition calling for domestic violence prevention lessons to be included in the school curriculum. She had considered the violence in her household as normal and wanted children to know better than that. Her petition, signed by more than 100,000 people, persuaded the NSW Government to include domestic violence education in the school curriculum. Of the change, Josie wrote: “I wish this change had of occurred in time for me to save my mum, but it makes me feel so happy to know it will exist to help others. Mum’s death wasn’t for nothing – it has now helped to create the change to save others.” The teen was also nominated for a Pride of Australia award. Maria Sevilla moved to Australia from the Philippines with her son, Tyrone, when he was two years old. She worked hard and they built a life here. But her skilled working visa application was rejected when Tyrone was nine because the government believed treatment for Tyrone’s autism would be a burden on the Australian taxpayer. “My child Tyrone has spent almost his entire life here, English is the only language he hears, yet now, at 9 years of age, the government are going to deport myself and my son to the Philippines because of his autism,” she said. Ms Sevilla was concerned her son would not have the same quality of life in the Philippines because they had no close relatives in the country and he couldn’t speak the language. More than 120,500 Australians agreed, signing her petition and prompting Immigration Minister Peter Dutton to change his mind and allow the Sevillas to remain in Australia. Three men took turns raping 20-year-old Katrina Keshishian by the bank of a Sydney river in 2008. They went to jail, but the gang rape survivor was paying dearly for the psychological help she needed to recover from the horrific crime. Six years and mounds of paperwork later, she was still waiting for her victims of crime compensation payment from the Government to come through. Then she found out it was going to be reduced by more than half the amount due to retrospective legislation. Katrina Keshishian talks about the difference her petition made (post continues after video): Luckily, her change.org petition garnered more than 134,000 signatures and resulted in a personal call from NSW Premier Mike Baird, who reversed the cuts to victim compensation. The huge policy back flip also impacted 24,000 other victims of crime. Shane Raisher begged Tony Abbott to save his life by putting an expensive but effective cancer treatment on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. At $10,500 every three weeks, it was sending him and his young family broke, he said. “This decision could mean life or death for me,” he wrote. “It could mean seeing my little boy grow up or not. But this is about more than just my family. 1,400 people are dying from melanoma every year in Australia – it’s one of the biggest, silent killers. Yet we’re dragging behind the US and Japan in approving this new treatment.” More than 170,000 people agreed with him, signing his Change.org petition. Sadly, the 32-year-old never got to meet his second son after losing his 15-year battle with melanoma. And, just weeks after his death, Abbott announced the drug would be listed on the PBS. His widow, Danielle, said it was a bittersweet moment, but she was glad her husband’s death would not be in vain. As a former nurse and police officer respectively, Lucy and Lou Haslam were the unlikely faces of the push to decriminalise medicinal marijuana in Australia. But, after seeing the positive impact it had on helping their terminally ill son, Dan – who died from bowel cancer in February at just 26 – deal with the side effects of chemotherapy, including nausea and loss of appetite, that’s exactly what they become. Lucy’s petition to decriminalise cannabis for terminal cancer patients was signed by more than a quarter of a million people.

https://www.mamamia.com.au/marijuana-moms/,"""Marijuana makes me a better and more creative parent.""","September 23, 2013","        By MAMAMIA TEAM So, a growing number of women in the USA are realising that the whole ‘parenting thing’ is actually kind of hard. The obvious solution? Get stoned. Yep – mums be gettin’ high. Several times daily in fact. Since medical marijuana became legal in California in the mid 90s, more and more parents have reportedly been turning to pot to help them combat the daily stresses of parenting. They’ve been dubbed ‘The Marijuana Moms of Beverly Hills’ (and no, it’s not a reality show… yet). Yesterday, Channel Seven’s Sunday Night featured the story of Cheryl Shuman – a woman who started smoking pot to remedy her depression – and who now deals the stuff to many of Beverly Hills’ stressed-out elite parents. A Californian mum who calls herself a ‘cannabis activist,’ Cheryl grows and distributes marijuana to anyone who comes to her, provided that they’re armed with a doctor’s note and enough cash. “I like to think we are bringing some glamour and exclusivity to marijuana use,” Cheryl explained in a recent interview with Channel 7’s Sunday Night. “These are successful corporate mums who use cannabis responsibly and it works well for them.” In a few short years, Cheryl has grown (literally) a marijuana empire worth millions of dollars. What started as a few plants in her backyard has become a 30-hectare medical marijuana farm. She has collaborated with top US chefs to create pot-filled gourmet meals, and sells a range of niche pot-products that are perfect for the woman who has everything (except an easy way to get high). Take for example, January Thomas. She’s 37 and the mum of beautiful two-year-old daughter Zenna. She also smokes pot five times a day and says that the drug helps her handle the pain of her early-onset arthritis. “Marijuana makes me a better and more creative parent. It puts me in the moment with Zeena and stops me worrying about everyday problems,” Thomson told The Daily Mail. But it’s not just the elite who are lighting up. This anonymous American mum wrote on website Jezebel about what it’s like to parent after having a smoke, in a story called “I’m a mum and I’m stoned right now”: “In the middle of playing some totally vacant, rule-less game that involved pretending to chew stuff, making growling noises, and giggling, I realized that she’s like the funniest fucking person I’ve ever met. Anybody who thinks that weed makes parents ignore their children has clearly never been high around one. Weed takes the edge off of my fatigue-induced bitchiness. It helps me not care so much about things. Wait, that sounds bad! I mean, it helps me not care about the stupid little unimportant things that I have a habit of getting hung up on and stressed about. …The point of all of this is that I know I’m not the only one, and I know I’m in good company, but I wish that more parents were open about smoking pot in order to reduce the stigma associated with it. You know, I’m a mom, but I’m also a person. Don’t put me in a box. Unless it’s a hot box. There have been numerous studies to show that marijuana has positive side-effects for people with chronic illness or pain. In fact, that’s why it became legal for medical purposes in California in the first place. But here’s the thing we want to know. While cannabis may make the parent feel better about how well they’re managing, does it actually make them a better parent? Highly regarded Australian addiction psychiatrist Dr. Karen Fischer was also interviewed as part of Sunday Night’s story and said there was no way marijuana could make someone a better parent. “I’ve not seen it. I’ve not seen it at all. And I can imagine it’s much like suggesting to me that tobacco’s making you a better parent, alcohol’s making you a better parent,” Dr Fisher said. “To me, cannabis has too many side effects for health,” she said, adding that the effects of smoking pot can be worse then what most people anticipate. “If we’re talking about coming into us for a cannibis withdrawal, what we see are people truly struggling with their sleep patterns. We see highly agitated people.” “We see people that don’t really know what to do with their time. We see people that have forgotten what it is to eat normally without having the stimulus that cannabis brings them.” “We see people that are quite horrified that it’s turning out to be as hard as it is for them to get off what they perceived to be a drug that wasn’t really that big a deal.” But Cheryl doesn’t think those risks outweigh the possible benefits. “We’ve all come up against people who say marijuana is for dirty druggies, but we are proof you can be good parents and productive members of society and use it.” “Now, I’m a much better mum. Sometimes I laugh and say ‘I’m not just a better mum, I’m a better human being’ because you know what? I’m so much more pleasant to be around these days. I’m always smiling, I’m always happy.” Do you think there it’s okay to smoke marijuana when you’ve got kids? What about being high when you’re actually playing with your kids? Is it any different to having a couple of glasses of wine? I think it's very sad that mothers think they need pot to be a better parent and I 100% agree with the stance that they just want to get stoned. That being said, I'm a mother who smokes pot. I smoke pot because I'm an adult who wants to smoke pot. OH HEAVEN FORBID! I grew up in a household where smoking pot was as common as having a glass of wine with dinner; so exclusively for adults and in the evening, often behind closed doors (until I was older and could better understand). Because of this upbringing pot holds no elusiveness or 'bad' stigma in my brain and is something to be consumed by responsible adults who have their shit together, which my parents absolutely did. And as for it's effects on my mothering? Well, it doesn't really affect my mothering. I mother sober. After my little sweet girl goes to bed my husband and I smoke a bowl and talk and laugh and bond (well, most nights). It's my treat and is just for me. My beautiful three year old deserves all of me and not someone who has to get high to think they're the funniest and most precious little person on the planet. Marijuana is not a drug...it is not man made and processed and filled with crap and fillers...it is as natural as tomatos or lettuce! I use this magnificent herb to help with pain relief and to help with numerous medical ailments...it even helps prevent my husbands seizures. Cannabis has also been prooven to cure cancer! No one has ever died from cannabis use alone EVER. It is safer than most pharmaceuticals and way safter than grog or tobacco which are all perfectly legal and kill people every day.. Granted it isnt for everyone and some people will find that its not for them..which is no different to prescribed pills from your gp...Hemp is fuel, food, fibre, medicine and so much more...it could save out planet and our economy!! As you may have also seen, sunday night did a poll on peoples views of medical cannabis and the number of people is favor ended up being about 80% than those who do not want it legalised..I would also like to point out that that foot baller had an amphetamine and alcohol addiction...but no it was tbe cannabis that ruined his life...what a load of rubbish...never have i seen a more one sided biased bull crap story... If you dont want to use it thats fine..it wont be forced upon you .. but for those of us who are desperate enough and have tried everything else shouldnt we also .have the right to choose! *NB I AM AWARE PPL USE CHEMICALS ON THEIR WEED PLANTS ETC...THIS IS NOT WHAT I AM SUPPORTING..I SUPPORT ONLY NON CHEMICALLY TREATED MEDICATION..MOTHER NATURE AT HER FINEST.. I have attached a photo of the sunday night poll results when there were a few hours still remaining...couldnt help myself haha...happy 4 20 all! Cannabis has also been proven to cure cancer! Really? Yes...thats right!! Studies have shown that cannabis red flags the cancer cells so the body is able to locate those cells and destroy them. Heaps of people have used cannabis (usually eaten or in the form of juice) to cure their cancer and lived to tell the tale.

https://www.mamamia.com.au/hangover-clinic/,Sunday's news in under 5 minutes.,"December 13, 2015"," We’ve rounded up all the latest stories from Australia and around the world – so you don’t have to go searching.  1. Australia opens its first “hangover clinic”, leaving health experts outraged. Australia’s first hangover clinic has recently opened its doors in the suburbs of Sydney, but has left several health experts outraged. The center, which is named hangover.clinic, offers consumers “revolutionary IV hangover treatments” that have been sourced from all over the world, including London, New York, Las Vegas and San Francisco. On the website it writes, “Sometimes, we just overdo it. Might be a BBQ at a mate’s place, or drinks with the girls, but since time began we’ve all been known to overindulge on the drinks, or our hectic schedules just run us down. “In as little as 30 minutes, we’ll have you off the couch feeling fresh and ready to tackle the day ahead…” The clinic sprouts three hangover remedies, including “The Resurrection” and then three health and fitness boosters that are priced between $140 – $200. Despite the seemingly innocent advertising, health experts have warned that the clinic’s opening further perpetuates a harmful drinking culture in Australia. The Australian Drug Federation, as told to 9NEWS, labelled the practice “unethical” and “totally unnecessary”. The chief executive of the Public Health Association of Australia, Michael Moore, echoes the sentiments of the ADF. “This encourages people to use alcohol in an entirely inappropriate way,” Moore told the Sydney Morning Herald, “and it’s something the government should look at very, very carefully. “After all the hard work that has been done to reduce the harm associated with alcohol…this is ridiculous.” The co-founder of the hangover.clinic, Max Petro, has defended its operations, claiming that it does not encourage binge drinking. “We don’t serve alcohol. We are not a pub. We encourage binge drinking as much as hospitals encourage people to get sick.”  2. Historic agreement finally reached on climate change in Paris.  The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, has finally called to an end the official discussions on a climate change agreement after a fortnight of negotiations. After banging his gavel the minister declared, “I see the room, I see the reaction is positive, I hear no objection. The Paris climate accord is adopted.” The Paris agreement is an unprecedented political recognition of the risks of climate change https://t.co/k3uA46GKe0 pic.twitter.com/gwJfib2qob — The Economist (@TheEconomist) December 12, 2015 The deal, which has been endorsed by a number of world leaders, sets out to restructure economies by operating as fossil-fuel free, and slow the rate of global warming to at least 1.5 degrees Celsius. Additionally, it provides billions of dollars to assists less economically developing countries to face the challenges of climate change and transition to emissions-free economies.  The #ParisAgreement on battling climate change is a turning point for the world, Obama said https://t.co/Oa1f1HlSQE pic.twitter.com/4qN7USwxAW — Los Angeles Times (@latimes) December 12, 2015  Foreign minister, Julie Bishop, has commended the work done in Paris, with only some hesitations. “Our work here is done and now we can return home to implement this historic agreement,” Bishop said. “No country would see this as the perfect outcome. Certainly it does not include everything that we envisaged. However, this agreement does give us a strategy to work over coming years and decade to build the strong and effective action the world needs.”  3. Mother admits to using cannabis oil to treat son who has ADHD. Cherie Dell is a mother to five children, with their three-year-old daughter, Abbey, suffering a rare genetic disorder called CDKL5, and her five-year-old son, Wyatt, diagnosed with autism and ADHD. Abbey, whose genetic disorder causes her to experience violent seizures, has been legally medicated with medicinal cannabis oil to help control her condition. However, authorities are now investigating Mrs Dell for also treating her son, Wyatt, with cannabis oil for his ADHD. Mum turns to cannabis oil to calm ADHD son: A MOTHER who legally treats her daughter’s seizures with cannabis … https://t.co/9d43xvtDWp — Creative Money Ideas (@WeCreate4) December 12, 2015 The Herald Sun reports that Wyatt’s disorder often causes him to be extremely violent, stating that he has even thrown tables around his grade one class. The extreme violence and subsequent impacts the family suffered led Cherie to also treat Wyatt with the same cannabis oil she used for Abbey. Mrs Dell claims that the cannabis oil has had a number of positive impacts on Wyatt’s behaviour. “He is calmer, he is not having outbursts,” she says, “we don’t have as many issues with him hurting his brothers and sisters.” Despite the benefits she reports, authorities are allegedly treating the mother “like a criminal”, as the treatment of cannabis oil on ADHD and autism still remain illegal. “I would never do anything to harm any of my children, I am only doing what I think is best.” The department of Family and Community Services has advised that whilst compassion may motivate the use of cannabis oil on treating a variety of disorders, it still have to be “supported by strong science”.  4. Memorial of the Sydney Siege has been revealed. The New South Wales Premier, Mike Baird, has finally revealed the design of the permanent memorial of the Sydney Siege at Martin Place. The Premier announced that the design would both honour those who died at the scene, and then pay tribute to the survivors. Inspired by the masses of flowers left after the siege, that occurred this time last year, hundreds of floral cubes will be laid into the pavement of Martin Place. The design has been described by the designer, Professor Richard Johnson, as a “scattered starburst pattern” and “quietly reflective”. The Premier had admired the design, saying the flowers “showed everyone across the city was prepared to stop what they were doing. “We are very proud of this city and that those that might want to come and bring hate, we have another message, we come together and respond in love.” Mr Baird paid tribute to Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson who both lost their lives in the siege. “I said at the time that Katrina and Tori would be in our hearts forever and they will be. “At the same time we never want to forget how we say the city and state come together. My hope is on that day we focus in on what brought us together rather than those forces that tried to drive us apart.”  5. Saudi Arabian women vote for the first time.  Women from Saudi Arabia have been legally able to vote for the first time in the municipal council elections. The historic step to allow women the vote has left masses of women celebrating, stating that they now have a voice.

And while it’s certainly one of the more memorable lines from the film, it’s not exactly true anymore. Slowly, the use of weed is becoming a bit less taboo and more socially acceptable.

With these law changes, we’re beginning to hear more stories about marijuana users – especially, why they need access to it. No longer is weed solely associated with the stereotype of glassy-eyed stoners, but we’re beginning to hear stories of those who use weed to ease symptoms of mental illness or the pain of physical ailments. We’re hearing stories of mothers desperately seeking medicinal marijuana for their sick children and pet owners helping their ill pets. And of course, there are definitely people who smoke marijuana for a bit of fun. We spoke to three women on why they smoke weed recreationally or self-medicate with weed, to get to know the stories behind the stigma. Side note – Mamamia Out Loud unpacked the the debate surrounding the decriminalisation of cannabis, get it in your ears below. Post continues after audio.  “My first time trying weed was pretty unsuccessful. My cool colleagues and I met up before a work Christmas party at one of the girls’ houses, and someone had brought pot. I was quite nervous to attend this staff party and can get anxious in social situations so I got very, very drunk before trying to smoke the weed, which probably wasn’t the wisest idea. Turns out I didn’t really understand how smoking worked (having never smoked anything) and didn’t get a high. Eventually, I got high with my flatmates – and it was worth the wait. I hallucinated that my head was about to fall off and had to get my partner to help me ‘keep it on straight’. It was heaps of fun, although I didn’t see why my then-flatmates would get high all the time (as soon as they woke up they would ‘wake and bake’ and smoke again in the afternoons). I didn’t think smoking was anything special, really. I mean, it seemed fine for the occasional fun time but I wasn’t interested in smoking more. Four months later, I began to get sleep anxiety. I got quite sick a couple of times, and I know that all the specialists tell you to get at least seven hours of sleep a night to ensure your immune system is strong, so I put insane amounts of pressure on myself to get to sleep. This caused me a lot of anxiety around sleep. There were nights when I’d sleep an hour or two a night because I was so stressed about getting to sleep. I’d think, ‘if I can’t sleep I won’t be able to perform at work’ or ‘If I don’t sleep I’ll get sick and I have no sick days left’. And yes, if I just relaxed, my body wouldn’t have been coursing with adrenaline and I’d be able to sleep fine. But I am a huge overthinker and I couldn’t stop. I ended up asking my parents-in-law for weed to help me calm down, and then began a reliance on pot to help me go to sleep. After smoking I could go straight to sleep within 60 seconds. I felt so care-free and didn’t fret all day about how much sleep I’d get that night, because it was guaranteed I would get some. I smoked every night for about four months until I moved away from my partner’s parents and no longer had access to the weed. The detox was… tricky, but not as bad as I thought. For the first few nights I was up until 4am each morning trying to sleep, but I had conditioned my body that sleep time means weed time. After about a week I was back to normal. My anxiety surrounding bedtime hadn’t subsided, but I wasn’t reliant on weed any more. Six months later, I started a new job and my anxiety surrounding sleep came back. My new boss wasn’t exactly nice to me, and I stressed about my performance again. One night I just didn’t sleep at all. I tossed and turned in bed for eight hours without sleeping – and I got through the next day. After that, I relaxed a little. If even on my worst day I could turn up to work, then I didn’t need the weed. I also rationalised that new mothers deal with way worse and more consistent sleepless nights so I didn’t need to resort to weed for help. The stigma surrounding weed used to bother me and I hated thinking of myself as a ‘stoner’, which I guess I was at the time. I used to get really anxious if my supply was becoming low and would only buy from people my partner and I knew and trusted. We had some really fun times while we were high but I’m glad we don’t smoke anymore. Every now and then – like if we stay home to watch a comedy on Saturday nights – I’ll wish we had a weed connection so we could light up but overall, I’m happy I’m off it. I do struggle to sleep at times but it’s no longer every day. I wish I had CBD oil in these cases to help me sleep.” “I smoke weed for several reasons. Firstly, to wind down after a long stint at work – I am sometimes away from my home for two to three days at a time for work. I also smoke to help my anxiety and because it feels amazing. Especially at munchies time and sexy times. I suffer from pretty severe clinical depression paired with generalised anxiety disorder. When I smoke I feel… lighter. I can focus on TV, a computer game, even study sometimes. These are things I struggle to do sober because my mind is so busy, I find it hard to focus on a single task. I do it because no other doctor-prescribed drug has helped to this degree. It helps me dull the voice in my head that says… everything. Like ‘You’re not good enough’, ‘did you turn the hair straightener off?’, ‘remember that time when you were 7 and you said something stupid?’ and ‘Fred at work seemed quiet today, he probably hates you’, and so on. After smoking I feel amazing. There is no hangover, no comedown. I have the best sleep and wake up feeling fine. During the high I feel… I can’t even explain it. Light. The weight of the world seems to become someone else’s problem for a while and I can just enjoy TV/computer games/sex/relax time. It makes things funnier and food taste better. When I budget hardcore, I smoke an ounce (28 grams) a month. But I can smoke an ounce a week. Generally, I lose my budget battle and get and ounce every 2 weeks. It’s $300 an ounce. The stigma doesn’t bother me per se, but the laws/legal system do. The marijuana plant can be used for paper, textiles, plastic, clothes, medicine, and a WHOLE lot more. It’s illegal because the big companies that profit from destroying the planet (paper, plastic, etc) don’t want to lose their profits. So they demonise it as a drug and it makes me so mad, it’s a plant, not ecstasy cooked in a toilet. I wish it was more widely accepted. Not “just” for medicinal purposes. For example, during the Melbourne Cup, alcohol and parties – domestic violence skyrockets. You never hear a story about a man/woman who got high AF and beat the shit out of their spouse. It’s less harmful and less addictive than current LEGAL drugs (alcohol, cigarettes, etc) I think it is a harmless but fun alternative to alcohol or ecstasy etc. I believe is should be legalised. It works and it’s something I also enjoy recreationally and I believe it helps me best in my current situation. I don’t want to have to rely on drugs that ARE unnatural and addictive like diazepam, which I have a prescription for. I don’t really drink alcohol. Mostly because I have a very high tolerance and end up getting sick before I get drunk so it feels redundant. Also, who wants to ever deal with a hangover? I’m very lucky that I have a reliable guy 15 minutes from home [for my weed]. However I have resorted to driving over an hour (each way) to get it, or rummaged through draws in my house hoping to find scraps. My brother smokes too so bribery is always an option. On very rare occasions when I’m highly anxious I’ll have a diazepam and a bottle of moscato (mixed with alcohol diazepam can act similar to ecstasy but not as intense) to help me escape reality. The first time I got high I was… 18-19 and at a mate from work’s party. There was weed there and he attempted to teach me how to use a bong. I coughed up my lungs and hurt my throat – but it was… insane. It hit me almost instantly and I didn’t lose control – I don’t like losing control. But everything just had this layer of ‘the world is good, who gives a sh*t?’ It’s very much a head high for me, but I’ve never been so high that I cannot think clearly (not without mixing it with harder things, of course) or keep control of myself, but at the same time – things are just better. Jokes are funnier, food tastier, existential crisis’ are put on pause and you can just enjoy the moment.” My first experience with weed was in my twenties with my husband at a family function. I was comfortable in the company of trusted family members. I had a great time dancing and eating which lead to the munchies! Weed mostly helps me with my mental health issues as I suffer from anxiety and depression sometimes, depending on the situation I'm dealing with. It also helps me relax at bedtime if my brain is overthinking. I take no medication from doctors when they advised me to take antidepressants because I find weed is a much better alternative with no side effects. After smoking or eating edibles I have a feelings of contentment and deep relaxation. Sometimes it feels like a sense of freedom as all the knots in my stomach undo and go away, at times it's drowsiness which helps with sleep time. Then, other times it's a feeling of increased energy - this is a perfect time to go for a walk, to clean my car or to get creative in my garden. If I'm feeling emotional, after smoking it's like I have no worry in the world. Sometimes I also have an increased libido. I also love listening to music when stoned. I probably smoke about 28 grams a month or 10 to 15 grams a week, and this costs me roughly $200 to $300 a month. At times the stigma around weed bothers me. The negative view of weed as a recreational drug with the criminal/illegal sanctions associated with its use... I tend to only associate with people who understand me and my health issues and understand why it's my choice of self-medicating. When I can't source weed, I'll resort to breathing exercises and meditation. Feature image: Getty Images. I've been smoking since I was 15 on and off. I go months without then will smoke for 6 months. As a person with bipolar, taking meds really squishes my creativity. It's all very nice being stable and I wouldn't have it any other way - it's how I got my life back together, that and giving up alcohol except for a few times a year. I don't get hangovers, I don't get aggressive, it motivates me to do things like housework and aids me in sleeping. It ramps up my creativity which is very important. As a post menopausal woman it does also help to lift the libido without the aid of hormone replacement. Contrary to most people's view of a stoner - it makes me engage socially and I actually eat less. An important part is knowing what smoke you are buying and keeping away from hideous chemical laden hydroponic skunky rubbish. Even better, grow your own and chose your strain and when to harvest to get the kind of high you want. Couchlock high is no fun imo and I don't see the point. Im Networking CBD oil in Australia, just search my name on google.Great acticle, hopefully, you guys might make it a regular Spotlight. Im suprised how many people are keen to learn and have to good regular source of product in Australia. We also, have access and able to sell all Hemp Herbal, we have a great skin care, Nigella Stavia. Before we only had access to products made only from the seed.

Everything we know about the wild cast of MAFS 2023.","January 30, 2023","To catch up on all the Married at First Sight recaps and gossip, check out the MAFS hub page. We've got you covered.  Another year, another selection of singles arriving on our TV screens to fake marry a stranger and fall in love/be involved in a cheating scandal. How exciting. This year, the infamous show will be kicking off on January 30 with 10 couples from around Australia, and Nine are certainly promising a good time. We've been told to expect ""the biggest shock ever to rock a wedding"" and a brand-new twist that will thrust the contestants ""into the unknown with dramatic consequences"".  And hoy boy, do we love when MAFS has dramatic consequences. Watch: the first look at Married At First Sight 2023. Post continues below video. With a matter of hours to go, here are all the people who will join the most cooked experience on television in 2023. Instagram: @alyssa_barmonde and @alyssabakescakes TikTok: @alyssabakescakes Image: Nine. Alyssa is an executive assistant (and cake influencer) who was raised Mormon in Utah. She has been single for 12 months following the end of her seven-year marriage. According to Nine, she has a two-year-old son who she prioritises over everything, including finding love. She finds dating as a single mum difficult, especially on those damn apps. She's nervous about walking down the aisle for MAFS but believes her soulmate is out there waiting for her.  A post shared by Alyssa (@alyssa_barmonde) Instagram: @_bronteschofield TikTok: @_bronteschofield Image: Nine. Bronte, 28, is an online beauty educator from WA who Channel Nine describe as an ""outspoken, fiery and confident"" ""pocket rocket"". Which I think is code for ""will give us the drama we tune in for"". Bronte is attracted to an ""alpha male"" who can hold a conversation (the bar truly is on the floor). According to Nine, she is used to receiving attention from men but has developed trust issues after being hurt and taken advantage of before. So she's, uh, put her faith in the MAFS experts to help her open her heart up again. What could go wrong?! A post shared by Bronte (@_bronteschofield) Instagram: @caitlinmcconville TikTok: @caitlintaylormcco  Image: Nine. Queensland makeup artist Caitlin, 27, is a ""hopeless romantic"" who falls hard and fast, which always goes well on a show like this. Nine describe her as having high standards and as unwilling to settle for anything less than she deserves, so she's supposedly ""chosen a solo life"" in recent years.  But ""after two years of no intimacy"" she's looking to the experts for an intervention. Image: Instagram @caitlinmcconville ﻿Instagram: @cforclaire_ Image: Nine. Claire is an ""unapologetically loud"" kindergarten assistant from Victoria.  Her parents are divorced, and she is extremely close to her grandparents, who are the result of an arranged marriage. Now she wants to be the one in the third generation to ""make it"" in love. Claire is both a Holden car fanatic and an astrology chart reading, crystal loving softie. The range! Channel Nine say she is ""all in"" when it comes to not just finding love, but a soulmate she can have kids and grow old with. A post shared by Claire (@cforclaire_) ﻿Instagram: @janellemyh TikTok: @janellemyh Image: Nine. Janelle is a beauty influencer from WA, with a whopping 528,00 TikTok followers. She is described as direct, driven, clingy and short-tempered. (Imagine reading a media package for yourself to find a publicist has written the sentence ""She's bossy, clingy, short-tempered and 'ridiculously picky' when it comes to men, finding any reason for confrontation."" I'd cry.) Janelle is incredibly close to her Singaporean Chinese family, whose family must love and approve of her partner.  She also has autoimmune disease Lupus, which, according to Channel Nine ""means her biological clock ticks louder than for many women nearing 30, so she feels pressure to have kids sooner that later"". ﻿Instagram: @10dall TikTok: @10dall Image: Nine. Ok, this is pretty incredible: 27-year-old accountant Lyndall, from WA, lives with cystic fibrosis and never thought she'd make it to 30, let alone marriage and children, so she didn’t prioritise any long-term plans. But thanks to new medicine that has dramatically extended her life expectancy and given her the lung capacity of someone without CF, Lyndall has a renewed outlook on finding love. She's also become a risk-taker who grabs every opportunity by the horns and wants her partner to match this.  Lyndall is described as unafraid of confrontation and always seeking justice, which once again is absolutely just code for 'drama'. A post shared by Lyndall (@10dall) ﻿Instagram: @melindarichelle Image: Nine. Melinda's description begins by describing her as an ""alpha female"". She's a Queensland CEO working in fashion and beauty, who can command a room. But underneath her confident exterior, Melinda is emotional and prone to self-sabotage in relationships. She's looking for an ambitious man who is business-minded, understands her lifestyle and won't be clingy. A post shared by Melinda (@melindarichelle) Instagram: @mel_sheppard1 Image: Nine. Melissa, a hairdresser from Sydney's Northern Beaches, is looking for a long-term relationship again after her 10-year marriage ended several years ago. She now co-parents her son and lives with her twin sister, and is ready to meet the man of her dreams. Channel Nine say Melissa is upbeat, cheeky and comfortable with her sexuality, and is looking for a man who can keep up with her. A post shared by Melissa (@mel_sheppard1) Instagram: @sandyjawanda TikTok: @sandy.jawanda  Image: Nine. Sandy, a dental hygienist from Victoria, has never been in a serious relationship... so what better place to start than with a fake wedding to a stranger? According to Channel Nine, Sandy grew up in a strict household and was not allowed to mix with boys.  Her lack of experience is a source of insecurity, so Sandy wants to fast-track dating with someone who can respect her boundaries and help her overcome her fears. A post shared by S A N D Y J A W A N D A (@sandyjawanda) ﻿Instagram: @itstahnee TikTok: @itstahnee Image: Nine. Tahnee is a fast-talking, passionate and bubbly PR manager from NSW.

A post shared by Tahnee (@itstahnee) ﻿Instagram: @adam_seed13 TikTok: @adamseed13 Image: Nine. Adam is described as ""cocky and confident"", so we're off to a... good start. He's a business owner who finally wants to settle down, after calling off a long-term relationship in his 20s because he realised it wasn't ready. Adam's been living in London for the past six years - it's where he was born, before being adopted by Australian parents and raised in Queensland - but has flown across the world to find love. A post shared by Adam (@adam_seed13) ﻿Instagram: @yepcams_on Image: Nine. Cameron grew up on a farm in Queensland before moving to Darwin to work as a carpenter in Indigenous communities in the remote Northern Territory. He's described as ""down-to-earth, cheeky and laid back"", but he also went ""out bush"" to mend a broken heart after he turned up to a hospital with flowers for a woman he had feelings for only to find her there with another man.  Cam's never had a girlfriend, yet he has full faith that the experts will find him someone compatible (oh, sweet summer child). A post shared by Cameron (@yepcams_on) ﻿Instagram: @danhunj Image: Nine. Dan is a semi-retired digital marketing business owner from the Goldie, whose profile includes the fact that he lives a ""comfortable lifestyle"" and that he drives a Porsche 911. Cool, cool, cool. He's been married twice before and is father of a 16-year-old girl.  He's looking for someone who can slot into his active outdoor lifestyle, and who is as motivated and ambitious as he is (and likes Porsches, probably). A post shared by Dan (@danhunj) ﻿Instagram: @duncan__james Image: Nine. Duncan is a Sydneysider working in cyber security sales, who ""has no trouble meeting women"" but is looking for Mrs Right... aka a woman he's physically attracted to, who has class, emotional intelligence and confidence. Lol. According to Channel Nine, growing up in a close family unit with two older sisters means Duncan understands and appreciates women on a deeper level. We'll see about that. A post shared by Duncan (@duncan__james) ﻿Instagram: @harrison_boon_ Image: Nine. Harrison is a builder from NSW who doesn't take himself too seriously, but after two years of single fun, he's supposedly now serious about finding love. He's a single dad of a three-year-old, and is open to having more children with the right partner.  He wants a woman who shares his ""zest for life"" and sense of humour, but also admits to having a ""ridiculously high"" bar, so here's hoping the experts nail it (they won't). A post shared by Harrison (@harrison_boon_) ﻿Instagram: @jesse_burford Image: Nine. Jesse is a heavy metal band member turned marriage celebrant from Perth, who officiates weddings in the style of a rock star. There really is a niche for everything. After officiating more than 500 weddings, he's looking for the love and commitment he sees regularly from other couples on the job. But Jesse is also extremely fussy, with an extensive list of turnoffs including wine snobs, gym junkies and cosmetic enhancements. So... he'll go really well on this show. Famously, no one on reality TV has ever had cosmetic work done. A post shared by Jesse (@jesse_burford) ﻿Instagram: @whitej81 Image: Nine. Josh describes himself as the ""station wagon"" of relationships, which allegedly means he's stable, dependable and solid as a partner. He's a single father-of-two who has struggled with navigating the world of dating apps following the end of his marriage, so he's put his faith in MAFS to help him establish a solid emotional connection with a partner. Have any of these people ever watched the show before? Anyway, Josh is looking forward to all the small things about being in a relationship, like sharing his day with his partner and having a laugh. Bless. A post shared by Josh (@whitej81) ﻿Instagram: @laymills Image: Nine. Layton has been an entrepreneur since he was 19, and his current project is in medicinal cannabis for pets (?!?!). He's a bit of a workaholic, which gets in the way of love, but has realised that something has to change. Now, he is looking for a woman who shares his work ethic, his sense of determination and drive. A post shared by Layton (@laymills) ﻿Instagram: @skeltonollie Image: Nine. Ollie is a confident, charismatic and supposedly ""mature beyond his years"" voice-over artist. He has sworn off dating apps, instead opting for the more reliable option of... Married At First Sight to find love. He was raised by his mum and two sisters, so is looking for a strong, independent woman who can also, get this, accept his sometimes lazy and stubborn nature.  Channel Nine really knows how to sell a person! A post shared by Ollie (@skeltonollie) Instagram: @shan_adams_44 Image: Nine. Shannon is a personal trainer. I was waiting for one of those to pop up! We got him! Shannon has a three-year-old daughter and was in an on-again-off-again relationship with his ex for many years, but he's ready to move on with someone he can build a future with. Nine say he's spent the past year on self-reflection and reflection and now believes he's the best version of himself.

https://www.mamamia.com.au/khandalyce-karlie-news-latest/,Thursday's news in under 5 minutes.,"October 21, 2015"," We’ve rounded up all the latest stories from Australia and around the world – so you don’t have to go searching. Nine News reports that police have “several suspects” in the investigation into the double murder of Khandalyce Kiara Pearce and Karlie Jade Pearce-Stevenson. The mother and daughter went missing from Alice Springs in 2006 and the body of Khandalyce was found this year in a suitcase dumped on the side of a highway in South Australia. Yesterday police announced a “significant development” in the investigation into the identity of that body occurred when a call came through on October 8 to Crime Stoppers, the 1267th call  “nominated Khandalyce as possibly being the little girl in the suitcase”. “Investigators then located a witness who had seen Khandalyce and her mother at Marion Shopping Centre, Adelaide, in November 2008,” police said. The mother of Karlie had reported her missing in 2009, but mysteriously withdrew the report five days later after being reassured her daughter was okay. It has been confirmed that Karlie’s body was dumped 1100 km away from her daughter in Belangalo State Forest in NSW. It had been found as a “Jane Doe” in 2010. For the latest developments read this post here. A Sydney café on the North Shore have banned  ‘feral’ children from the venue due to their “disgusting” and “deplorable” behaviour. Black Mocha Café in Turramurra have announced they have removed their playroom- set up for young children – after  they became appalled by rowdy, disruptive children who disturb other patrons. “Black Mocha Café no longer offers a ‘kids playroom.’… Our café was designed with families in mind unfortunately so we have had to make a decision that is heartbreaking for both sides,” the owners of the café announced on Facebook.  Last year a newspaper review of the café called it a “paradise for parents” with its playroom allowing parents a break from their children. The owners of the café have told The Daily Telegraph that the decision was heartbreaking but the situation became so dire they had to ask themselves: ‘do we want to keep the children or do we want to keep the café?’ The owners Mr and Mrs Osterberg say parents sit in the café for three hours after buying just one coffee, allowing their children to “break toys, draw on the worlds, and run and screech unsupervised around the café.”   Their decision has drawn praise from many on social media. One man writing: “I find it totally incomprehensible how parents would act like this or let their children act like this. Surely these parents should show some form of responsibility for their children. Very much the “me” generation in these cases. “  Warning: this item deals with sexual assault and may be distressing for some readers.   The 23-year-old Iranian asylum seeker Nazanin was allegedly raped in May this year. The ABC reports that Nauruan police do not dispute that Nazanin was sexually assaulted. She was taken to Brisbane after her health deteriorated. Her brother and mother told Lateline that the Federal Government needs to reunite them. “As a mother, I cannot tolerate the suffering of my child. I don’t want to live,” she said. She and Omid, Nazanin‘s brother are able to occasionally call the young woman who remains in care in a Brisbane hospital. “She is a young girl being alone in hospital, she is scared and just always crying whenever we have a phone call,” Omid said. “My mother, my sister, they are dying gradually, they are dying and we are really alone here. The ABC reports that both Omid and his mother have attempted suicide due to their distress. “All the doctors and trauma specialists and the psychologists, all of them are saying that the most important part of my sister’s medical recovery is she needs her mother, she needs her family to be beside her.” The Department of Immigration and Border Protection told Lateline “The individual concerned has been receiving appropriate medical and mental health support and care,” it said. “The Department takes allegations of sexual assault and criminal conduct very seriously and immediately refers them to the appropriate authorities for investigation.” “The Department reviews all requests for family reunification on a case by case basis.” For help: Lifeline 13 11 14. Kid’s Helpline: 1800 55 1800. DV and Sexual Abuse hotline 27/4: 1800 737 732 The QLD Health Minister Cameron Dick has launched an investigation into the death of a boy who was waiting for emergency lung surgery at the Lady Cilento Children’s Hospital last month. The 12-week-old boy was scheduled for life-saving surgery at the hospital in August but because of a bed shortage, was forced to wait for a transfer from Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital. The child died on September 17. His death comes just weeks after a 15-week-old baby from Maryborough requiring brain surgery died after the Mater Mother’s Hospital could not find her a required bed. “She needs this surgery I can’t stand to see (her) weak and struggle any longer,” her mother wrote on social media, reports The Courier Mail. “LCCH had (a bed) we got told then suddenly (we) don’t … I want to be a step closer for her to come home and meet her family.” The baby girl was booked in for emergency surgery but was discharged and sent home the following day where she died soon after.   A judge has order the sacked NRL player to stay away from the women he allegedly stalked. The court also issued “orders of protection” for two other victims, the man who came to the women’s assistance during Lodge’s alleged rampage, Joseph Cartwright and his wife. The 20-year-old is accused of following the two women home to a unit block and telling them “this is the night that you die”. He faces up to 25 years in jail for a string of offences, which include assault, criminal mischief, reckless endangerment, and first and second-degree burglary. Fairfax Media reports that Lodge’s father assisted in the payment of $US20,000 ($A27,500) bail. A trial at Brisbane’s Lady Cilento Children’s Hospital next year will allow children with severe drug-resistant epilepsy to be treated with medicinal cannabis. Health Minister Cameron Dick said yesterday in a letter tabled to parliament “[It is] an opportunity to show medicinal cannabis can be a safe and effective addition to existing treatments,” he wrote in the letter. “As more information becomes available, I will be better placed to consider what is in the best interests of all Queenslanders, including the need for legislative change.” Australian researchers have made a world first fertility breakthrough giving older aspiring mothers “good eggs.” News Limited reports that a team from the University of Adelaide’s found haemoglobin was present in “good eggs” but missing from bad quality or “broken” eggs. “The haemoglobin inside the eggs made them more efficient and looks like it alters the way the egg uses energy and the amount (it) needs to use,” Dr Brown said. Australian law does not permit trials on humans reports News Limited but they have begun in Belgium, where it is not against the law for women to donate eggs for scientific purposes. On trials on mice the researchers added the haemoglobin to bad eggs and then fertilised those eggs (via IVF). “We got more healthy embryos”, Dr Brown said. “We improved the quality of the eggs.” “We know fertility starts declining at 32, and between 37 and 42 your eggs are in dramatic decline — and the ones you have left are of poor quality. Potentially this offers … an opportunity that might not exist now,” Dr Brown said. “Prevention is better than cure … while we can attempt to repair a broken egg, we can’t replace them if you run out.”   Accompanied by President Barack Obama at the White House, he said that he came to the decision with his family as they “worked through” the grieving process following his son Beau’s death. He said the grieving process “closed the window” of mounting a campaign and they are “out of time”. “My family has suffered loss and sooner rather than later, when you think of your loved one, it brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eyes. That’s where the Bidens are today, thank God,” he said. His announcement ends months of suspense and removes a huge political obstacle for front-runner Hillary Clinton.   Petra László apologised last month, saying “something snapped in me” when she was caught on film tripping up the man, and kicking two refugee children while working on the Hungarian border. However, in an interview with the Russian newspaper Izvestia, she has said she plans to take legal action against Facebook for allegedly refusing to remove threatening groups on the site and deleting groups that supported her. My husband wants to prove my innocence. ‘For him, it is now a matter of honour,’ added Laszlo. A study has found that while men say they like smart women – they are threatened by them. A study to be published in the November edition of ‘Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin’ says that rather than find smarter women attractive, men are actively intimidated by the prospect of an intelligent partner. They found that the men were more likely to declare their attraction to women who had performed better than them. “Men formed favorable impressions and showed greater interest in women who displayed more (versus less) intelligence than themselves,” the study authors wrote. However when men were given an intelligence test and then informed that they were about to actually meet a woman who had performed better than them the men “distanced themselves more from her, tended to rate her as less attractive, and showed less desire to exchange contact information or plan a date with her.” The key, according to the study, is that in the second scenario, the men felt threatened by the physical presence of a clever woman: “Feelings of diminished masculinity accounted for men’s decreased attraction toward women who outperformed them in the live interaction context.” It’s a crisis of never before seen proportions – well if you are the parent of an eight-year old boy. The world is running out of Lego – right before Christmas. The Telegraph reports that the company who make Lego have announced they cannot keep up with worldwide demand. “It is really extraordinary and it has exceeded both ours and our customers’ forecasts,” spokesman Roar Trangbaek said. He tried to reassure Lego enthusiasts “”We are running our factories at maximum capacity and will do everything we can to meet demand,” The Telegraph reports that the company is building a new factory in Jiaxing in China, 100 kilometres from Shanghai, which is expected to be up and running in 2017.

[post_snippet id=324408] I really do feel for the owners of the Mocha. After all the time, money and effort they've put in, trying to create and provide something really nice for parents and children to enjoy, along with everyone else, it must be so disappointing. The unappreciative ferals have given them a big slap in the face. And, thanks to the irresponsible, thoughtless parents, there's one less social outing available for all the other children and parents to enjoy.  Number 10 - Everyone knows that, they did not have to do a study on it. Well at least now when men will not admit it, we show them the study to prove it.","Oct 21, 2015 ...

Why should we care about autumnal colours, leather and felt hats in summer in Australia? Are we supposed to remember that this stuff is trendy in 6 months when we go into winter?  @mystal84 absolutely. Microdosing is being used in other countries with really incredible results. We've legalised medical cannabis treatments, why can't we legalise this for use under medical supervision? How can you legally be prescribed opioids which are highly addictive,, destroy lives and have created a thriving illicit drug market, but you can't be prescribed non-addictive substances derived from mushrooms that grow wild in Australia that Australians can literally go out and pick themselves?  @mish11 then you're willfully ignoring all those who've been irreparably damaged by it. How many churches are being forced to sell property to pay damages for systematic child abuse? How many LGBTQ kids took their own lives or were disowned because of religious parents? How many girls were forced to give birth to children that were the result of abuse because religion forbade abortion?  Maybe it's just me, but a man who constantly publicly praises me all over social media is not ""husband goals"" to me at all. That sounds awful. It's enough for me that my husband shows ME love and respect. He doesn't have to perform it for strangers for likes. It's weird and creepy.  Forever New is still fast fashion. If you're going to buy a statement staple like a trench coat, the idea is to invest in good quality, well made items that will last for years. Nothing from a fast fashion brand qualifies. @michelle.james137 how is it public if it's, not only a private business, but you have to pay a fee to be there? I would question that legal advice.  @mamamia-user-482898552 I have worked at multiple universities and in several creative industries where these outfits would be fine in the office. I've worked in offices attached to heavy industry where high vis was de rigeur and these outfits would be too dressy ""Office"" doesn't imply anything about the type of business or the dress that's deemed appropriate. ""Corporate"" does though. You look lovely and there is some good advice here (ditch underwire bras!). I work in a pretty relaxed office too so anything goes. I think less people in the comments would be taking issue if you dropped the word ""corporate"" all together since these outfits are more casual or smart casual. ""Corporate"" infers a very specific type of workplace, like a law or finance firm where suits, ties and strict standards of professional dress are adhered to. But that shouldn't mean the rest of your great advice is ignored. I have been looking for a great blazer and thrift all the time, but never thought to look in the men's section! @rush this is exactly it. 15 year old YouTube influencers with perfect skin, towelling on layers and layers of makeup is an incredibly unrealistic way to apply makeup if you ever want to leave the house or be observed in natural light. I'm all for people having fun and expressing themselves with makeup, but when you have young girls who think they need to spend hours contouring their face into an entirely new shape just to leave the house, it's not healthy. I was a teenager in the 90's and none of my friends were makeup at all unless we were going out. We never even thought about about it. It makes me sad that that has been lost to some extent.  @mamamia-user-482898552 men literally never hold other men to account. We know not to expect that. As always, it falls to women to try and make men behave decently I've been trying to phase social media out of my life to regain some mental space and Instagram just made it easier to delete this app. Thanks for being terrible as always, Facebook! @mustlovebooks he's been creeping on Millie Bobbie Brown from Stranger Things since she was a literal child if you want and indication of how much of a creep he is. Excellent article. Now I'm 42 I was looking forward to becoming ""invisible"" the way many older women report they do. I thought it would be wonderful to not have to worry about being groped and harassed because men didn't find me attractive any more. And now I have to worry about some douchebag feeling sorry for me instead and giving me flowers? The best gift a woman could ever get is men leaving her the f**K alone @dolphin_girl41 yet here you are reading and commenting on an article about who she was dating so clearly you do care... @rush yeah anyone over 35 with an internet connection and a passing interest in her music has known this for decades. @mamamia-user-482898552 so because you choose to read articles about her being criticised, you think SHE sounds exhausting? Honey, someone is exhausting here and it ain't her Listening to the podcast Maintenance Phase really hit home for me how the diet industry is really a massive scam that sets people up to fail. Highly recommend it if you are interested in a really well researched, funny and compassionate exploration of food and exercise fads. Why let one ignorant idiot ruin this for you? It's not like it's the instructor who said that.  Complaining about poms in Bondi is like complaining about Aussies in Shepard's Bush. Just get out of the backpacker tourist havens and you'll find a country full of different people. Hell, drive 20 minutes to Marrickville and you'll find Greek, Vietnamese and Lebanese communities. I never understand why people go directly to the areas where specific people are known to congregate and then complain it's full of those people.  Cadbury is trash, but I honestly can't taste the difference between the British stuff. It's all rubbish, cheap chocolate. There is plenty of great chocolate to be found in Australia like Koko Black, Hello Tiger, Haigh's (which is an institution) and Mrs Peacock.Christmas in summer is the best. If you're going to make the effort to travel to spend time with friends and family, being able to swim, bbq, and sit under trees to eat and relax, beats the hell out of huddling inside a too small house where you can't get away from each other. I would love to recommend the podcast Maintenance Phase. It's primarily to debunk diet fads and the wellness industry, but it's also really great at explaining anti fat bias and digging into the lived experiences of fat people (one of the presenters is a self-proclaimed ""fat lady about town"").  One of the main takeaways is that weight and health aren't the same thing. People expressing concern about fat people's health, never ask them for health markets like resting heart rate, BP or cholesterol levels. It's always about weight. People basically just need to mind their own business.","We've legalised medical cannabis treatments, why can't we legalise this for use under medical supervision?

He was energetic, always smiling and had every kid up and out of their seat when he came on the stage. Harding is now a father to a gorgeous four-year-old girl, Arielle. Arielle has epilepsy and can have 50 to 100 seizures a day. See Tim back in his Hi-5 days. Post continues after the video… Although Tim, 37, and his wife Natasha, 31, have tried everything to help their little girl – her condition is drug resistant and nothing they’ve tried has improved her condition. Ariel’s epilepsy can cause terrible side-effects. So the family’s next hope is that Arielle will be picked for a new cannabis-derived drug trial. ""This is the only relatively natural treatment that has any anecdotal evidence of working,"" Tim told New Idea. Arielle had her first big seizure when she was 15-months-old. Her parents have been dedicated to fighting against her epilepsy ever since. ""We’re keeping our fingers crossed she gets this treatment so she can live life to the fullest,"" Tim said. The trial is a world first, with children from NSW being treated for severe epilepsy. Premier Mike Baird announced the Government's commitment to the cause last Tuesday. Children will have access to a safe supply of the new cannabis-derived drug from early next year. Baird said it was an amazing day for many families across NSW. ""It's a day that I know has given hope to many of these families ... if we can bring relief to these poor children, who wouldn't want to do that?"" he said at Randwick Children's Hospital the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

https://www.mamamia.com.au/physical-grief-symptoms/,Last month I lost my dad. There are 4 aspects of grief I didn't expect.,"April 3, 2022","When a parent dies, it’s so incredibly hard to comprehend that you will no longer create another memory with them. This is a person who taught you everything you know; someone who has been there at every major life event.  No matter how much warning you receive that they’re going to die, it still hits like a tonne of bricks when it actually happens. Even if you actually see them die in front of you, you’re still likely going to be shocked by the fact you can no longer cuddle them or share further memories.  Watch: Robin Bailey on losing her dad at a young age. Post continues below. My dad, Peter Brian Hudson, was a remarkable person, husband, father, grandfather, professor and musician.  But boy, was he unlucky. Seriously, someone would’ve had a better chance at winning the lotto twice than going through what my dad endured.  In 2017, Dad was diagnosed with a stage 4 prostate cancer that was incredibly rare; only 47 cases recorded in the world. No one had lived past five years.  He had been complaining about back pain for years, but his PSA readings had continually come back as normal. Further examinations showed he had a deadly cancer, adenosquamous carcinoma of the prostate, but it’d already breached the organ. It was likely in his blood.  Surgery. Radiation. Chemo. Hormone therapy. More radiation. Chemo. Steroids. Surgery.  It was exhausting, but mostly he did it with a smile on his face, wearing comically colourful socks, ensuring it wouldn’t get us down. His positivity gave us hope that maybe, just maybe, we’d find a cure. Or perhaps even a miracle would occur? We’d read about other people’s miracles, so why couldn’t our dad have one?  It was a rocky road, with cancer popping up in various areas, but he was defying the odds of his predicted life expectancy. He even got to meet two of his adoring grandchildren, my two boys, who kept him very occupied.   Medicinal cannabis helped dad through pain and insomnia.  During this time, he even recorded four albums, which are now on Spotify. A self-taught artist, the songs are all written, played and recorded by my dad in his home studio.   In his previous academic “Professor” life, he wrote and published hundreds of research articles.  I thought perhaps he’d go on to do so much more.  But then, the unthinkable happened.  Dad had been in a small car crash. He was confused and disoriented.  Mum decided to take him to the hospital for a CT scan.  I will never forget the day. December 28, I was playing cricket in our backyard with my family when my dear mum called me.  “It’s a brain tumour,” she cried.  Low and behold - another rare, primary stage 4 cancer, but even deadlier than the first. An enormous butterfly glioblastoma. The ‘butterfly’ aspect means it’s covering both sides of the brain, making it even harder to treat.  How could one amazing man be so unlucky? He wanted to live more than anyone I knew. He still had so much more to offer.  From then on, every day was a struggle for Dad, however, when I came over to their house every second day with my two little boys, he’d muscle up every bit of energy he had to play with them. Even swim in the pool at times.  We often spent time laying on his bed, cuddling him and showering him with love.  He could barely walk or see out his right eye, yet my dad would do everything humanly possible to have more special moments with my boys. Being “Poppa” was one of his favourite roles.  Grandparent photo taken just days after dad was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Image: Supplied.  Words can’t fully describe how wonderful, exhilarating and beautiful this man truly was - he exuded an excitement for life like no other.  Dad had a seizure while I was cuddling him. He had only just finished reading a book to my boys. Two days later, he died in hospital with my mum, brother, sister and me by his side. We knew he was dying, yet when he died, we still couldn’t comprehend that we’d never see him again. Why were we still so shocked?  Image: Supplied.  We hadn’t seen anyone outside our immediate family in months, but it was a small sacrifice to make - none of us wanted to ‘be the person’ who gave dad COVID-19 and potentially fast-tracked his death. I worked from home and my kids didn’t go to childcare.  That day when we came back from the hospital, one person down, now just the four of us, we invited some family over to help ease the pain.  This is my first real experience with grief and for those who may go through it for the first time as well, here’s what I have learned so far:  Sometimes, you may feel fine, particularly when you’re distracted. Other times, it will make you sick to your stomach. Someone may ask a simple question like “how are you?” and it could very well set you off.  Grief can control your entire body, from feeling physically sick to being exhausted all the time. Strange things may start to happen to your body – for me, I get bouts of nausea and have tinnitus from stress. People are so kind and want to help, but no one is going to be able to make the pain go away. I feel robbed of time, like many do when they lose a loved one. People say lines like “I know how you feel”, or “It’s not as bad as....” Try to understand that these sentences have good intentions; they come from empathy and not knowing what to say.  My dad was not a religious man, and neither am I, so what I’ve been grappling with is “an eternity of nothingness” for him - the man who I knew as being full of life.  The scientist in him knew that energy can’t be destroyed – humans have energy and therefore, his energy will be around us. I take comfort in that.  Technology also makes it easier for us to remember those who pass. My little boys, who are one and three years old, watch the dozens of videos we recorded of their “Poppa” and talk to him – none the wiser that he is no longer physically here.   100 years will go by – will he be remembered?  Peter Brian Hudson was more grateful to be alive than anyone I knew. I know people die younger, but I still feel like I’ve been robbed of time. Since his death on March 1, I have listened to his albums – and wow – my dad has left us so many beautiful messages.  “Live your life your way” being one of the main messages to come out of one album. Dad lived every day like it was his last. He never took anything for granted. It was like he had more time, with the amount he crammed in his 65 years. Hundreds of people attended and watched dad’s funeral. Even an Italian man who sound mastered dad’s songs watched via Zoom – they hadn’t met, but he said he considered Dad a friend.  I will never know why my dad was dealt such s**tty cards – maybe it was so I could remind you all how precious and short life truly is?  From here on out, I’ve made a pact that I am going to make sure my dad is remembered passed 100 years, through my kids, and theirs ... because he deserves that.  “Every day is a gift and I can’t wait to see what it holds” – Peter Brian Hudson.

No one decided to pile on this poor diddums one day without him having said anything.  Tarang Chawla should also most definitely be on the list of men worth listening to and being considered role models. He has done wonderful work as a feminist ally and campaigning against gendered violence.  This case makes me feel physically sick. That poor woman and child. Even as someone working desperately to have their second child, it is easy to recognise this as an outstanding and valid article. Excellent writing. As a parent but also a teacher, I would insist on one or the other of the children being moved so that they are not in the same class. The whole purpose of looking at class organisation and groupings is to ensure the best possible combination of students, especially in continuing years where any clashes are already known. Make it clear to the principal that you expect your child to be in a class that does not include their tormenter.  Is there anything else women are doing wrong, whether by choice or otherwise??

Now, they want him back.","May 8, 2019","  Early last month, three-year-old Noah McAdams was diagnosed with cancer. The little boy from Florida was found to have acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and he began chemotherapy. But before long, his parents, Joshua McAdams and Taylor Bland-Ball, decided he’d had enough. “He had vicious mood swings making him violent, making him very emotional,” Bland-Ball told news station KTRK. “He also started to lose his hair right away after the first treatment.” Noah was due for another chemotherapy session at John Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in mid-April. But his parents didn’t bring him along. They took their son to Kentucky, to try alternative treatments. “We busted on out of that hospital – with no cancer cells left to spare,” Bland-Ball wrote in a Facebook post. “Doctors are amazed at his speedy healing and strength!”  She went on to detail the remedies she was using on Noah, including rosemary, a “completely alkaline diet”, collagen, “daily colloidal silver”, grapefruit peel and breastmilk. “We will continue to use these remedies for maintenance for the next ten years!” she added. The hospital took action. Child protective investigators got a court order to take Noah into custody. His picture appeared on the news, and within hours, the family was found in a Kentucky motel. Noah was taken from his parents. Local authorities began investigating McAdams and Bland-Ball for neglect. But the couple fought back. “Our kid should not be away from us and we are not neglecting our kid,” Bland-Ball said on Facebook. “The media made it look like we were neglectful criminals.” The couple’s lawyer, Michael Minardi, said they were planning to treat Noah with medical cannabis. He explained why they hadn’t turned up for the chemotherapy scheduled by the hospital. ""They're saying that this child is in immediate danger when the fact that there is... no cancer showing in his blood and there is no indication that at any point in time... that any cancer is going to come back in his body,"" Minardi told media. Noah is now in the care of his grandparents. A custody hearing is currently taking place. ""You should have seen this little boy yesterday,"" Bland-Ball posted on Facebook. ""Absolutely traumatised by medical professionals and the separation from his parents. And where is the state to provide him with mental health care to make sure he’s okay? THIS IS TORTURE. ALL BECAUSE WE CHOOSE TO TREAT HIM DIFFERENTLY AND IT WAS WORKING AND JOHN HOPKINS' EGO IS BRUISED.""  However, the head of the Moffitt Cancer Centre's acute lymphoblastic leukaemia program, Dr Bijal Shah, says there’s no way of saying Noah is cured of leukaemia at this early stage in treatment. Dr Shah says for patients with a standard risk who follow the treatment plan, there’s a cure rate of 90 per cent. That plan involves continuing chemotherapy for two and a half years. ""The overwhelming likelihood is that without further therapy this child will relapse,"" he said. Want more Mamamia stories?

Police are yet to release the results of DNA tests on the cap, but a Facebook post on the Looking for Theo Hayez Facebook page on Saturday confirmed the family strongly believed it was Theo’s. “Over the past months, many of you have been wondering about the results of the DNA testing of the hat found in bushland off Tallows Beach on July 7th,” the post read. “Although no DNA results have been released publicly and may not be for some time, the family is certain that it is Théo’s hat. “The hat found was the exact same model and colour (grey, not black), shows the same wear and tear on the brim, and the position precisely matches one of his last known GPS locations.”    Police announced last month Hayez’s disappearance had been referred to the NSW coroner His family celebrated his 19th birthday on September 29, without knowing what happened to him. Theo has not been seen since May 31, when he left Byron Bay’s Cheeky Monkey’s nightclub. His phone last ‘pinged’ near Cape Byron Lighthouse on June 1. He was reported missing on June 6 when he failed to check out of his hostel, leaving his belongings and passport still in his room. Protesters lay on tram tracks at Bourke Street Mall before being moved on by Police. #ExtinctionRebellion #9News pic.twitter.com/IimAcSxdb6 — Nine News Melbourne (@9NewsMelb) October 11, 2019  Hundreds of thousands of dollars will be spent on overtime for police officers who worked during week-long climate change protests in Melbourne. Victoria Police Commander Tim Hansen said on Sunday the force was still totalling the cost of the Extinction Rebellion protests in the city, but overtime was already high. “The overtime budget is in the hundreds of thousands already… 16,000 patrol hours have been deployed,” he told reporters on Sunday, adding that 111 people had been arrested. “It has had a huge impact on our resourcing out in the regions and out in the suburbs.” Commander Hansen slammed the organisers for keeping police in the dark about their movements during the “spring rebellion”, which meant officers had to be taken off other duties. The commander ruled out making the protesters pay for the costs incurred during their activities, as that would only be applicable if there is a “level of commerciality”. “This is clearly a public community protest in public space. We are resourced and financed to deploy in those circumstances,” he said. The Extinction Rebellion movement held protests from Monday to Sunday including marches and other protests aimed at blocking traffic across the country. Among its requests, the movement called on governments to “tell the truth” about climate change by declaring a climate and ecological emergency. The moment that won it for the Silver Ferns.

Australia have blown a five-goal lead to lose 53-52 to the Silver Ferns in the first Test of netball’s Constellation Cup in Christchurch. A dominant third quarter on Sunday put the Diamonds ahead 44-39 but a series of errors quickly evaporated their advantage. The match was the first between the teams since July’s World Cup final in England where the Silver Ferns upset the Diamonds 52-51. Diamonds coach Lisa Alexander said it was frustrating to watch her team’s lack of attention to detail in the crunch moments. “I think we went away from some areas of our game plan that we had made a commitment to do. “And got a little bit sucked in to the environment that was going on around us and that will be a learning, particularly for the new players, that they can’t let that distract them,” Alexander said. The final quarter steadily worsened for Australia, who also lost goal shooter Caitlin Bassett. She left the court in discomfort and was replaced by Caitlin Thwaites. Bassett was one of Australia’s best, shooting 26/30 before leaving the game. The four-Test series will move to Auckland on Wednesday and Alexander said her captain would be “cherry ripe” for game two. The Diamonds found themselves down 26-25 at halftime after a poor opening half in which they were unable to capitalise on turnover ball. Australia, who hold the Constellation Cup, were particularly wasteful in the attacking third as their connections from the mid-court to the shooting circle were rusty. Alexander brought Laura Scherian on for her Test debut late in the second quarter and she was more efficient when feeding the shooting circle. “She’s just reminded us about how accurate she is with her feeding and the work that she does. She’s enormous in there. It was terrific to see her out there,” Alexander said. But that fluidity went out of the Diamonds’ attack in the final quarter and the Silver Ferns regained the lead with seven minutes to go and never gave it back. After Auckland, the series heads to Australia for Tests in Sydney and Perth. Nearly 8000 South Australians are going hungry each month, as a new report reveals the number of people seeking food handouts has grown by 15 per cent this year. More than 130,000 people in SA are seeking food relief each month, compared with 117,260 people last year. Of those people, it has been revealed that more than 7876 people are unable to be fed by charities. The report, released by Foodbank SA, confirmed the “very sad fact” that food demand could not be met in the state, chief executive Greg Pattinson said. “Despite our best efforts, we still can’t get to the parts of the state that really need our help, either due to the high cost of transport, logistics or that we just can’t get enough food…” he said. The report also found that women are 50 per cent more likely to go hungry than men. Mr Pattinson said the state government needs to do more to address the problem. “There shouldn’t be more than 7000 South Australians every month worrying about where they are going to get their next meal,” he said. Foodbank runs five food hubs across SA, as well as a mobile food van for remote communities. The Foodbank Hunger Report surveys 2,000 charities from around the country. An extra 30 children with epilepsy will be able to take medicinal cannabis as the state government expands its scheme to help more lives. https://t.co/8U1Wwcdg6O — SBS News (@SBSNews) October 13, 2019  A Victorian teenager who spent the past seven years battling up to 50 epileptic seizures a day hasn’t had any episodes since taking medical cannabis. Madison Williamson, 15, has been taking medical cannabis as part of her treatment for epilepsy for the past 10 months and hasn’t had a seizure since, her mum says. “Over the years the seizures changed. She ended up having cluster seizure where they could be up to 50 a day,” Amanda told reporters in Melbourne on Sunday. “Within two months, I realised that there were no boxes ticked for seizures. There’s been nothing since to this day. Everything has changed.” Madison has become the poster girl for the state government’s decision to expand its scheme for children with intractable epilepsy to use medical cannabis from 60 to 90. “We are going to expand the program to 90 children so that more children have the same opportunities to fully participate in society, to see a reduction in their seizures,” Health Minister Jenny Mikakos announced, adding it would cost $3.7 million annually. Ten children will be immediately added to the scheme, with the extra 20 young people to start on the scheme next year. Canadian pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol is used in the scheme. Royal Children’s Hospital paediatric neurologist Jeremy Freeman said many patients, aged from infants to 18, benefited from using the product with their other medication. “For the patients that have a good response, the change is pretty dramatic and fairly quick,” he said. “About half the patients we’ve treated have had significant reduction in their seizures and two-thirds of those are major reduction (less than half the normal amount of seizures), about a third of those have had about a minor reduction.” The hospital has about 30 children on its waitlist for the scheme, which has also been rolled out at Monash Health and the Austin Hospital. Ms Mikakos wants the federal government to add the medication it to the PBS. The federal government last month announced $3 million for clinical trials looking at how cannabis can be used to help treat cancer pain and other side effects. Opposition leader Michael O’Brien said more work needed to be done to find out if it is as effective as it can be before it goes on the PBS. “(But) if it is going to be effective in helping young people get through very difficult medical problems, I wouldn’t have a problem with it being added to the PBS,” he said.

In a candid interview with Sunday Style, Today host Karl Stefanovic has revealed that one of the first times he tried marijuana was at work in a Queensland television studio.   “That was the first time I really had it when it wasn’t just grass clippings,” the 40-year-old presenter told Sunday Style. “I remember someone just handing it to me and saying, ‘Here, you need to loosen up, Preppy’. I had a lot of laughs. “We do stupid things as adults, but I’ve never thought of that as one of them.” In an engaging and candid interview, Karl opened up about his vices. On drinking, he says, “I have fun up until the point I have too much. And I don’t particularly like the person I become. “I’m a pain in the arse and just talk and talk and talk and talk and talk about myself. It’s almost like being at confession. But as you get older there’s a certain amount of navel-gazing that goes on, and so I don’t drink as much as I used to. I don’t like losing control.” Reflecting on his 2009 post-Logies show, which went internationally viral, Karl admits he was worried at first. “There was definitely some serious concern about the ramifications for me at a professional level. I was worried.” Karl Stefanovic: “No one is buying what you’re selling Prime Minister…. Luckily, the most powerful man in the country came to his aid. (No, not Alan Jones, although he too called Stefanovic that morning to offer his support.) “No-one knows this, but Tony [Abbott] rang me and he said, ‘Maaate, as someone who, ah, as someone who recently got into trouble for being a little tipsy at a work function, I just want you to know that I sympathise with you.’” Watch Karl’s infamous post-Logies antics here.   The ramifications of Karl’s tipsy on-air antics continue at home, however. When asked how he approaches the issue of drinking with his kids, he reveals: “That’s hard. Really hard. I mean, when I say to my 15-year-old son, ‘Don’t go and get pissed,’ he’s like, ‘Dad – where do you want to start on YouTube?’” When it comes to stealing viewers from Sunrise, Karl has a not-so-secret plan. He has previously told the Daily Mail what he thinks is wrong with Sunrise, “They are so uptight. They have no sense of humour.” Not so for Karl. “I take huge enjoyment out of making people smile and laugh, and huge enjoyment out of making people feel something,” he says. “We’re modern-day entertainers, but we also inform and are expected to do great breaking news. And I take that extremely seriously when I’m doing it, as seriously as anyone in the news game. I want to be the best that I can be.” Does this interview raise Karl in your esteem? So, he was always a dick? No surprises there then. Has he apologised yet for the spider-spraying incident? Yes, EVERY NOW AND THEN...

https://www.mamamia.com.au/olivia-newton-john-natural-therapies/,We spoke to Breast Cancer Australia about Olivia Newton-John's 'natural therapies.' Here's what they told us.,"August 9, 2022","When Dame Olivia Newton-John was diagnosed with cancer for a third time in 2017, the international superstar was quick to talk about the 'natural' treatments she was leaning on.  In an interview with SurvivorNet, she shared that her husband, John Easterling, the founder and chairman of Amazon Herb Company, was making her tinctures (liquid extracts) from the cannabis that he grows. She was also taking natural supplements; including turkey tail, Graviola supplements, vitamin B17, and high doses of vitamin C from the Amazonian fruit, camu camu. But Newton-John was taking these treatments in conjunction with conventional cancer treatment.  The actor started receiving photon radiation therapy after her third diagnosis and had previously undergone radiation, surgery and chemotherapy.  Her team said that she would be completing the radiation in addition to natural wellness therapies after consulting with her medical team at the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Centre in Melbourne, Australia. As we mourn the death of the 73-year-old this week, it's important we acknowledge that. Because as CEO of Breast Cancer Network Australia, Kirsten Pilatti, tells Mamamia, ""there's alternative and then there's complementary and we need to focus on the complementary.  ""We know that there is so much in our clinical work that can really help stop cancer progressing...so we need to make sure that we're then looking at what other things we can do that will compliment that treatment to help the individual not just from the cancer, but also their own quality of life."" Watch Olivia Newton-John on 60 Minutes. Post continues. During COVID-19 we saw a rise in people turning to 'alternative' medicines to treat or help ward off the virus, which ultimately culminated in many turning away from the vaccines created to help fight death and hospitalisation.  In 2021, Newton-John said she had no plans to get the COVID vaccine. Her daughter Chloe said the same citing, ""I'm anti putting mercury and pesticides in my body, which are in a lot of vaccines,"" in an interview with The Herald Sun. So while we mourn the death of an incredible mother, woman and Australian performer, we just need to reiterate a few things.  Vaccines remain the most effective tool for preventing infectious diseases and improving global health. They eradicated smallpox, allowed us to control childhood diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella and polio, and in the case of COVID-19, they have helped us reduce death and serious illness.  In regards to cancer treatment, Pilatti supports ""people sharing their lived experience of that is working for them...but it needs to be surrounded by evidence and it needs to be working with your treating team, so they fully understand all the things that you're doing as a person that may impact the traditional therapy as well.""  Olivia had been fighting cancer for three decades, across three separate diagnoses. Most recently, she was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer.  A post shared by Mamamia (@mamamiaaus) She shared generously about her experience with cancer, helping and inspiring others with her words and positivity, while also raising money and awareness for cancer research.  Pilatti says that what people like Olivia have shown the medical world over the last 30 years, is that ""we shouldn't just be treating the tumour, but the whole person...and that was such an important message that she gave to everyone."" Olivia described cannabis, for example, as a ""magical, miracle plant"" and had been lobbying the government to approve the use of medicinal cannabis for cancer patients. ""It’s really helped me with the pain, with sleep, with anxiety, and, I believe with inflammation,"" she told Andy Cohen on What Happens Live in 2020.  In 2018, she told Mamamia's No Filter podcast she ""went to a wonderful place in Mexico called 'Hope4Cancer' that does all-natural therapies, and I spent three weeks there, learning them and doing them and making my immune system strong.""  That's all well and good, if, as doctors reiterate, it's done in conjunction with traditional medicines.  As Integrative Oncologist Jonathan Stegall, MD, shared online after her third diagnosis: ""Olivia Newton-John has been diagnosed with cancer for the third time, and is reportedly treating it 'naturally.' I wish her the best, but natural therapies should be adjunctive and not stand-alone treatments.""  Olivia Newton-John has been diagnosed with cancer for the third time, and is reportedly treating it ""naturally."" I wish her the best, but natural therapies should be adjunctive and not stand-alone treatments. #integrativeoncology #cancerhttps://t.co/ti9Dwx9Cni pic.twitter.com/uSpww9gFc6 Pilatti reiterates: ""We're so thrilled there are lots of clinical trials currently in place to really test and try different treatment options to make sure that we can understand and know that it will benefit people rather than do harm.  ""So investment in clinical trials will be really important, so we're moving on evidence-based [treatment] that's going to work best for the patient.""  Right now the country is mourning the death of a beloved Australian.  For Pilatti, she's thinking of those currently living with the disease for whom today will be a ""really difficult day."" But even in recent years, after so many years living with cancer, Newton-John remained positive.  As she told US Weekly in 2019, ""If you think positive thoughts, you’ll create a positive world around yourself and attract positive people to you.""  She leaves behind a loving family and community, life-saving contributions to cancer care and research, and a remarkable legacy and journey that has inspired cancer survivors around the world.  Feature image: Scott Barbour/Getty","Aug 9, 2022 ...

Her husband Gerard Baden-Clay was convicted of her murder this year. The Baden-Clay girls, now aged 7, 10 and 13, live with Alison’s parents. “They brought all three of us up and now they are doing it again. Their lives have changed. But they wouldn’t have it any other way given the circumstances that have been thrust upon them,” Fowler said. “The girls come first. They will do anything and everything for the three girls. That’s their life now and that is their focus.” They still have contact with their other grandparents. The girls are also seeing a counsellor, and the family allows for those meetings to be kept confidential between the counsellor and the girls.
 A Sydney private hospital allowed a cocaine-addicted neurosurgeon to operate on patients, despite him being banned from practicing at a nearby public hospital. According to a Fairfax/Four Corners investigation, Suresh Nair remained a practising neurosurgeon at Sydney’s Nepean Private Hospital, despite The Nepean public hospital warning staff in writing that his appointment was potentially dangerous, and Nepean Private receiving a visit from police who were investigating the death of a sex worker from a drug overdose at Nair’s home. Nair was arrested nine months later, following the death of a second sex worker at his apartment. During his time at Nepean Private, Nair performed several botched operations. Nair has just finished serving a four year sentence after being convicted of manslaughter and supplying cocaine. It is expected that he will now be deported to Malaysia.

 If elected in November, the Victorian branch of the Labor Party would legalise marijuana for medicinal purposes.

 The threat of a major volcanic eruption has put Iceland on red alert, with meteorologists feating that the Bárðarbunga volcano, Iceland’s largest, could be about to blow. All flights into the region have been cancelled in preparation for an ash cloud that would potentially cause aviation chaos. Ash from the eruption of Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull volcano in 2010 stopped flights over Iceland and much of Europe’s airpsace for six days. The disruption affected more than 10 million people and cost $1.7bn.
 A US study has found that women who read the Fifty Shades of Grey series are more likely to be in dangerous relationships. The study, conducted from a sample of 650 women at Michigan State University, found that women who had read the series were 25% more likely to have a partner who yelled or swore at them, and 34% more likely to have a partner with stalking tendencies. Those who has read the book were also 75% more likely to have fasted for 24 hours, or used a dieting aid. The nature of the study means that it is unclear whether these behaviours started after they read the books, or were pre-existing.
 Don’t know what you’re wearing for Halloween this year? Why not go as the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge?     Buy one at BrandsonSale.com (Just make sure you donate to MND Australia, too.) Please use the term cannabis. Marijuana is a term for cannabis when used as a herbaceous drug. Marijuana was a Mexican term popularised by prohibitionists in the US around the end of the 19th century. It was intended to associate cannabis with foreigners and use racism as a tool to further the prohibitionist cause. It is non scientific, vague, and has racist undertones. Pretty safe to say that the word marijuana has been re-appropriated from the prohibitionists by now. I don't believe David Farnell should be allowed to have a child in his care regardless of if it is biologically his. From my experience pedophiles can't be rehabilitated because they don't believe they have done anything wrong, they convince themselves it is for the benefit of the child. I also don't think you can ever recover from being sexually abused as a child, it's something you try to heal from, but it will change the course of your life and change who you are as a person forever.","Aug 23, 2014 ...

The Chair of the Committee, Sarah Mitchell MLC said, “We recognise the risks and negative effects of crude cannabis use particularly via smoking and by no means do we endorse the recreational use of cannabis. However, the Committee considers that on the basis of the available evidence, providing for a very small and specific group of patients to use crude cannabis products for medical purposes legally is both appropriate and compassionate.” 3.

Michelle Rowland, the Labor Member for Greenway went public with the Coalition’s refusal and has since been granted permission to leave parliament for the day to be with her 14-month-old daughter. She will have to return for Tony Abbott’s Budget Reply speech this evening.   Look at News No. 7 Labor is playing political stun again. Labor MP Michelle Rowland said her daughter was sick with a fever on Mother's Day( 12/5). Why didn't she stay at home with her?Then she put an application on 14/5 for a leave to be with her daughter starting on 16/5, 6 PM (tonight). She should go home immediately on 14/5 if the kid got sicker. What is the point to apply a leave starting 2 days later - Labor tried to distract Abbott's budget reply tonight. Having played race card, gender card and class card, now Labor is playing sick kid card. How low they can get? Perhaps someone else was able to look after the child on the other days but not today. Why shouldn't politicians have workplace rights to leave like everyone else and not have to justify it to the public every time their kid gets sick?? She didn't need a pair as there is no voting.You see why I have a trust issue with these people ?No one stops her from going home, that was her choice.Seems odd that she spent a great deal of time giving interviews to All and Sundry about this instead of rushing home. Angelina, good on her for sharing, it will save lives and that is all that matters. Thommo, pffft ! Weed for pain ? er I would rather a Pill to take away my life when I choose, but if weed helps those who want help then I don't see why not, put it in cookies though, don't smoke that stuff. Did Labor write this article? No. It's not them getting themselves in the press - it was the Oppositions actions that got them in the press. You have no idea how sick her kid was or wasn't on what date, or what care the child had at that time, so saying ""she should go home immediately"" is insane. How do you know her partner isn't a pediatrician and already at home caring for the child? And would you say that any male MP whose child gets sick ""should go home immediately""? If you were away doing important work interstate and your kid got a fever (but was being well cared for) would you jump on the first plane home, or waiting see if the kid got better and THEN request sick leave? I'm guessing you'd do the latter. The controversial issue here isn't whether the MP should or shouldn't have taken sick leave to care for her child, or whether she requested it early enough. Regardless of whether the kid got sick on the 14th or today, it's the Opposition who refused her request. Labor didn't do anything, and they're not the ones getting it in the press. The Opposition did the wrong thing by refusing carers leave - they got themselves in the press. She didn't need permission to leave, that is the whole point. I'm not Angelina's biggest fan, but I say good on her. Not everyone has the means to be proactive. If memory serves, her mother died of cancer, right? Perhaps she did it not only for herself but for her family. She has 6 kids to think about. She wouldn't want to leave them without a mum. As for the 'boob job cover up' - puhlease.

Yesterday, Labor leader Bill Shorten conceded defeat. “I have spoken to Mr Turnbull and congratulated him,” Mr Shorten said. He added that Labor was willing to work to find “common ground” with the government. Australia’s top scientists have declared “the end of AIDS” as a public health issue. Researchers from the Kirby and Peter Doherty institutes and the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations have announced the age of the fatal syndrome over, ABC News reports. At the disease’s peak in 1990s, about 1,000 Australians died each year. But the mid-1990s advent of anti-retroviral medication, which stops HIV from progressing to AIDS, saw the number of AIDS-related deaths in Australia plummet. Now, the numbers of AIDS-related deaths in Australia so low it is not recorded. A seven-year-old boy from Victoria is in critical condition after being hit by a car on Saturday. The boy was struck in Main Street, Bairnsdale, shortly after 3pm yesterday. He sustained head injuries and was taken to Bairnsdale Hospital.  Ambulance Victoria spokesman John Mullen said the child was flown to the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne, The Age reports. As of yesterday morning, he remained in a critical condition. Investigators are reviewing CCTV footage and speaking to witnesses, according to The Age. The Dallas sniper who shot five officers and wounded seven more at a Black Lives Matter protest was sent home from Afghanistan after allegedly sexually harassing a female soldier, the New York Daily News reports. Micah Xavier Johnson, 25, served in the Army Reserve for six years from 2009, the US military said. But in May 2014, in Afghanistan, he was accused of sexual harassment by a female soldier that involved him reportedly buying her kinky Victoria's Secret underwear. The soldier, Ana Ma, sought protection in 2014 against Johnson. After lodging a complaint, Ma also requested the military equivalent of a restraining order to keep Johnson away from her. She also reportedly suggested psychiatric care for the Army reservist.  Johnson was ultimately discharged from the army in April 2015. Queensland mums are allegedly being breastfeeding-shamed by health practitioners. The Courier-Mail reports that fed-up mothers are turning to social media to share their frustrations at the attitudes of some health workers. Some mums claim GPs have asked them not to feed during consultations, while nurses in hospitals have closed curtains around them. “It’s difficult enough for vulnerable new mothers learning how to breastfeed without the very people who should be supporting them telling them to cover up,” parenting and breastfeeding expert Pinky McKay told The Courier-Mail. Osama bin Laden's son has threatened revenge against the United States for assassinating his father. In an audio message posted online, Hamza bin Laden promised to continue al-Qaeda's fight against the US and its allies . “We will continue striking you and targeting you in your country and abroad in response to your oppression,” Hamza said in the 21-minute speech, entitled “We Are All Osama."" “As for the revenge by the Islamic nation for Sheikh Osama, may Allah have mercy on him, it is not revenge for Osama the person but it is revenge for those who defended Islam.” Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan US commandos in 2011.

 Bali 9 ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will be executed together in Bali. The news comes as Indonesia announces plans to execute six people this weekend. Myuran Sukumaran had his clemency plea rejected on December 30, but Andrew Chan has yet to receive any answer regarding his clemency – but Indonesian Attorney-General HM Prasetyo said that they would be executed together as they committed the crime together. It is the first time in a year Indonesia has conducted executions. The six death row inmates, all on drugs charges, will face firing squads on Sunday. Five men and one woman. They are from Brazil, Nigeria, Malawi, Vietnam and Holland and one is Indonesia. Indonesian Attorney-General HM Prasetyo said authorities were prioritising the execution of drug cases, that there would be no clemency or compromise for drug cases. The Jakarta Post reports that the Attorney general said that the government would prioritize drug convicts over others and that more executions will follow this batch. The executions will take place by firing squad.
 By ABC News Belgian police have killed two men who opened fire on them during one of about a dozen raids against a group that was about to launch “terrorist attacks on a grand scale”. Federal prosecutors said a third man was arrested during the operation in the eastern town of Verviers, between the city of Liege and the German border. They said they had not established a direct connection to last week’s attacks in Paris. No police were injured in the operation. “The suspects immediately and for several minutes opened fire with military weaponry and handguns on the special units of the federal police before they were neutralised,” said prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt. Local television network RTBF said the operation intended to check on suspected radicals, one of several conducted against people believed to have returned to Belgium after taking part in the Syrian civil war. Other reports said gunshots and several explosions were heard on a residential street near a railway station. One photo posted by a witness on Twitter showed police vehicles and ambulances blocking the street. Earlier, Belgian authorities arrested a man on suspicion of supplying the Paris gunmen with weapons.

Satellite images reveal the scale of the devastation suffered by the towns of Baga and Doron Baga, which were seized by the Islamist insurgents last Wednesday. Other nearby towns and villages were also attacked over this period. Over 3,700 homes and other structures were razed, with Doron Baga very nearly wiped from the map. ”These detailed images show devastation of catastrophic proportions in two towns, one of which was almost wiped off the map in the space of four days,” said Daniel Eyre, the Nigeria researcher from Amnesty. ”Of all Boko Haram assaults analysed by Amnesty International, this is the largest and most destructive yet. It represents a deliberate attack on civilians whose homes, clinics and schools are now burnt out ruins.” Amnesty says that thousands of people have fled the violence across the border to Chad and to other parts of Nigeria adding to the hundreds of thousands of internally displaced people and refugees, and stretching the capacity of host communities and government authorities. Funerals have taken place in France four people killed in last week’s attack in Paris on Charlie Hebdo. A private funeral service was held for Tignous, 57, ahead of his burial in Pere Lachaise, Paris’ best known resting place for writers, artists and composers. In a tribute at the ceremony, Tignous’ colleague Corinne Rey described him as the “king of jokes”. A ceremony was held for Wolinski, who was to be cremated. His daughter Elsa said “We stand here and will continue to defend the principles of Charlie Hebdo.” Friends and family also farewelled Charlie Hebdo columnist Elsa Cayat, the only woman killed at the magazine massacre and Franck Brinsolaro, a policeman assigned to guard Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane Charbonnier. As reported yesterday the Federal Heath Minister, Sussan Ley has announced the government has backed down on plans to cut the Medicare rebate by $20 for short visits to the doctor. The backdown came just a day after Prime Minister strongly defended the measure as an “economic reform” that would lead to better patient care.
 Overnight the Oscar nominations have been announced with many expected Aussies snubbed in the race for a gong.   Julianne Moore in Still Alice is the favourite for best Actress while Birdman’s Michael Keaton is the expected to win best actor. Sound mixer David Lee was the only Aussie among with nominees for his work on Angelina Jolie’s film Unbroken. A funeral has taken place for a five-year old girl whose father threw her off a bridge last week in the US. Phoebe Jonchuck’s father, John was arrested and charged with her murder. It has been revealed that his lawyer raised concerns with police about his mental state only hours before Phoebe’s death. For more read this post here. By ABC A Sydney man charged with possessing a homemade bomb that police alleged was wrapped in shrapnel and designed to maim or kill, has been refused bail. Appearing via video link in Penrith Local Court, Harley Roy Turnbull swore at magistrate Dorelle Pinch when bail was denied. The court heard that Turnbull planned to take the device into a public place and use it as a “conversation starter”. The device was covered in duct tape and had blue wires attached to it. Police prosecutor Sergeant Ben Seabury said it also had 50 ball bearings wrapped around it. He said the bomb was designed to “kill or maim” and would have been “catastrophic” had it been detonated in public. Magistrate Pinch said it was unclear who gave Turnbull the device. His lawyer Brad Mallinson argued that his client believed it was a fire cracker or “something you would put on a birthday cake”. Mr Mallinson said his client “never touched it because he didn’t know what it was”. But police said there was evidence that Turnbull knew it had a detonator. Turnbull’s mother discovered a suspicious black package at the family’s Werrington home on Tuesday and called police. It was examined by forensic experts before being taken to a nearby park and safely detonated.  A version of this story was originally published on ABC and has been republished with full permission.
 A video showing a teacher violently abusing a child in a daycare centre has shocked many across the world, and caused the closure of the centre. The video which shows a teacher attempting to get a child to eat, the child refuses and spits out the food, so the teacher brutally slaps her causing her to be flung across the room. Dazed and sprawled on the floor the child then reaches for the spoon to eat the food. CNN reports that local mothers have taken it in turns to protest, standing holding banners in nearby streets. The nursery has been closed. Warning: This video contains violent images and may be distressing to some viewers.    Crime writer Ruth Rendell, author of over 60 best-selling novels is in a critical but stable condition after suffering a stroke.
 A father has been charged with supplying dangerous drugs to a minor and possessing dangerous drugs after giving his two year old daughter medical cannabis. The Cairns man who is due to appear in court today has taken to social media to defend his actions. His two-year-old daughter was formally diagnosed with advanced neuroblastoma in December; she started her first bout of chemotherapy a few weeks ago. The father claimed he was trying to increase her “50 per cent chance of survival.” “My aim was to create an alkaline climate in her body, provide a nutrient-dense diet, alkaline water, essential oil therapy, and a healing environment of fun and positivity,’’ he wrote. His ex-wife, the girl’s mother told The Cairns Post that her daughter’s doctors had reported it to police, and that she herself was outraged by his actions.
 A woman is suing a tights manufacturer because she did not get an orgasmic experience when she wore them, like the women in the commercial selling the products. The New York Post reports that the woman, Meng Wang is claiming in a federal class-action suit that she was duped into believing she’d get some “good vibrations” from the pair of black “shaping tights”. The ad for the product shows a woman striding along the streets muttering phrases like “That’s the spot!” and “Oooh, yes!’’. The sexually charged background song croons “I feel super satisfied, super satisfied!’’ The suit says that the softly moaning woman is “literally show-stopping, causing male and female passersby alike to stop in their tracks to look at her with their mouths agape,’’ “Towards the end of the commercial, the woman opens her eyes to find herself surrounded by a group of excited women fascinated with knowing her secret to feeling orgasmic on city streets. “She eagerly tells them, ‘Oh, it’s Kushyfoot’ and distributes their products from her shopping bags to each of the women,’’ who then appear to be in the throes of excitement themselves thanks to the product. But Wang was disappointed that when she put on the Kushyfoot tights all she felt was another pair of socks. The New York Post spoke to Wang’s lawyer who said that Kushyfoot’s claims were similar to a marketing campaign by Skechers “Shape-up” model which boasted it could help tone buttocks, legs and abdominal muscles just by standing in them. Skechers settled a related class-action lawsuit for $40 million in 2012.  Shark sightings at Newcastle beaches have prompted the closure of the beaches for a record seven consecutive days. A great white shark “as big as a car” was spotted and photographed by a Fairfax Media photographer. The council said, “Sightings of this shark have been across all beaches, from Stockton to Merewether.” “It is not safe for anyone to be in the water, including board riders, even close to shore, as sharks are known to move into the surf zone, hunting prey between where the surf breaks and the shoreline.” Yesterday surfers at Stockton Beach saw a large fin near the breakers about 10am. MM: it would be nice if you included that the man had been using a marijuana oil that DOES NOT cause a high. THC has to be heated and turned into THD to get you high. When THC is infused in an oil it can be consumed or applied topically to help with many different ailments. There's a TONNE of research to support what he was doing. Marijuana is NOT a dangerous drug. It's about time we started questioning the governments reluctance to trust it citizens to make decisions about their own medical treatment.

And to iron.,"March 21, 2012","Grooming and etiquette classes for boys At least one school in Sydney has decided its Year Nine boys need a touch of civility drilled into them so St Augustine’s College has introduced classes which teach the teenagers how to iron, sew, make the bed, shake hands properly and who should pay for dinner on a first date. The Daily Telegraph reported: Middle School dean Peter Nolan created the Unitas program of 10 subjects to give students something exciting and different. “We often find that boys lose their way at school – the novelty of Year 7 has worn off and the focus of the senior years isn’t quite in their reach yet,” he said. “Education is about opening doors. It’s not just about getting a great result at the end of Year 12. It’s about developing character and building individuals.” Now there’s a marijuana vending machine But it’s in just so no-one gets charged with dealing, so it’s totally OK. A New Zealand club has installed a pot vending machine (just converted a regular kind) after its founder Dakta Green was jailed in June 2011 for possessing, selling and allowing the warehouse to be used for drug taking. Cannabis clubs are set up as places where marijuana is sold to people for medicinal purposes. Police said they were ‘monitoring’ the club. Models wearing fake bumps to model maternity clothes Actually pregnant women aren’t good enough to model maternity clothes if you take an industry snub as evidence. ‘Regular’ models are hired in states like Victoria and fitted with a baby bump under their clothes and sent to work. Maternity wear retailer Kelly Tredwell, from oneontheway.com.au, said she was concerned to learn some maternity models were not pregnant. “If you shove a bump or cushion up your top then you are not really showing how women really look,” she said. Melbourne-based Soon Maternity features Chloe Cameron, a slim, 26-year-old non-pregnant woman, as the face of its autumn/winter range. Cameron, who has never had children, is wearing a prosthetic belly, but this is not disclosed on the company’s website. A spokeswoman for Soon Maternity said the company preferred to use pregnant models, but they were not always around on the time and day it needed them. Elite French police in raid on suspected Al-Qaeda serial killer Some of France’s best police launched a pre-dawn raid in Toulouse on the home of the man suspected of shooting dead three Jewish school children, a Rabbi and three off-duty soldiers in separate attacks. Two officers were wounded as the police specials weapons squad cornered the 24-year-old French national in a house in the southern French city. His name is Mohammed Merah. His mother was brought in to help negotiate but said she ‘had no influence over him’. Hours later and it appears the stand-off continues with French police refusing to confirm the suspect has been arrested and France’s interior Minister Claude Gueant also denying the rumours. Gueant said Merah was an Islamic extremist. “This person has made trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan in the past … and says he belongs to al-Qaeda and says he wanted to avenge Palestinian children and to attack the French Army,” Gueant said. “He has links with people involved in jihadism and salafism.” Don’t come house-knocking Federal MP Steve Georganas wants to introduce laws that would prevent door-to-door salesman approaching homes directly for business. But, of course, politicians, religious people and charities would be exempt. Mr Georganas said the Do Not Knock Register would cost little to set up and would be modelled on the Do Not Call Register. “My mother, for example, says ‘my telephone bill is so expensive now’, and I say ‘when did you change company?’,” he said. “She says ‘there was a lovely young lady who came and told me I should’.” Shoe ad under fire for being in favour of cheating Shoe brand Reebok, owned by Adidas, said it would not defend advertisements that appeared telling men to ‘cheat on your girlfriend, not on your workout’. Adidas said it did not condone the message, or cheating of any sort, and the ads had only appeared in Germany. Perhaps the greatest surprise here is that Reebok are advertising at all. My Dad, who grew up in the 50's and 60's always did the dishes with his Dad as a kid. Growing up myself he always did the ironing in front of the TV and I always prefered the nights he cooked because he added a bit more ""spice"" to a meal than Mum did. Now I have 2 boys of my own. My eldest, who is 11, has always enjoyed watching me cook and I have told him that next year, when he starts high school, he can cook one meal a week.

By Susan McDonald Social Services Minister Scott Morrison has closed a loophole allowing some parents not to vaccinate their children on religious grounds. The Federal Government had already moved to deny childcare and family tax benefits to parents who claimed a conscientious objection to vaccination. Last week, Mr Morrison said he only expected a very small number of families to be exempted on religious grounds, if they were registered with their church or similar organisation. He said there are no mainstream religions that have objections registered and it is believed his latest move follows consultations with religious leaders. A version of this story was originally published on ABC.  Luke Lazarus, the man found guilty of sexually assaulting a young woman behind a nightclub owned by his family, is set to appeal his conviction in the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal. Along with an appeal against his guilty verdict, solicitors for Lazarus are also preparing to challenge the maximum five-year sentence handed down by Judge Sarah Huggett. Lazarus was convicted by a jury in late February for the rape of an 18-year-old woman in an alleyway behind Soho Nightclub. He told his victim that he was a part-owner of the venue, and that he would take her to a VIP area and to meet the DJ. Instead, he led her to an alleyway behind the club and anally raped her. Judge Hugger described the rape as ‘spontaneous and opportunistic’ and Lazarus as a young man with a sense of ‘power and entitlement’. Lazarus continues to maintain that the sex was consensual.  Police in Victoria have applied to detain an 18-year-old man without charge after his arrest in counterterrorism raids in south-east Melbourne. The man from Hampton Park is one of five men who were arrested yesterday in raids across Melbourne. It is alleged they had been planning to carry out an Islamic State-inspired terrorist attack on Anzac Day next weekend. Yesterday, another 18-year-old man, Sevdet Besim, of Hallam, was charged with conspiring to commit a terrorist act and appeared in the Melbourne Magistrates Court. He did not apply for bail and was remanded in custody until next Friday. However, defence lawyers told the court Besim would apply for bail at a later date. Two other men aged 19 and 18 have been released and police say another 18-year-old will be charged on summons. A version of this story was originally published on ABC.  A 300 metre long ‘trail of blood’ has been discovered along a service road adjoining the Great Western Highway. The pools of blood were first noticed by a Wentworth Falls resident on Saturday afternoon, who called the police. Forensic examinations have confirmed that the blood belongs to a human, with Inspected Sonya Tabor telling Fairfax Media that the significant volume of blood found suggests a ‘violent incident’. “We found several pools of blood that were about 15 centimetres in diameter and then a trail that went on for a while,” Inspector Tabor said. No local hospitals received anyone with corresponding injuries . Inspector Talbor is urging anyone with information to contact Katoomba police headquarters or CrimeStoppers on 1800 333 000.  Police have appealed to the public for information about the disappearance of a teenager who was last seen in Sydney’s inner city. Katelyn Simpson, 14, from Kogarah was spotted at Redfern Railway Station at 11:00am on Friday, police said. Officers said the girl’s mother had been informed her daughter was last seen at Lakemba at 1:00pm on Friday, but police said they have been unable to confirm that at this stage. Officers said they held concerns for Katelyn’s welfare due to her age. She is described as being of Caucasian appearance, 160-165 centimetres tall, with black hair with blue tips. Police said she was last seen wearing black Adidas tracksuit pants, a black Nautica short sleeve t-shirt and pink Nike running shoes. Officers have urged anyone with information about the girl’s whereabouts to contact Kogorah police or Crime Stoppers. A version of this story was originally published on ABC.  A mysterious disease that kills patients within 24 hours has claimed at least 18 lives in a south-eastern Nigerian town, the government says. “Seventeen people have died of the mysterious disease since it broke out early this week in Ode-Irele town,” said Ondo state government spokesman Kayode Akinmade. The disease, symptoms of which include headache, weight loss, blurred vision and loss of consciousness, killed the victims within 24 hours of their falling ill, he said. Laboratory tests have so far ruled out Ebola or any other virus, Mr Akinmade added. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said it had information on 14 cases with at least 12 dead. “Common symptoms were sudden blurred vision, headache, loss of consciousness followed by death, occurring within 24 hours,” spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said. Another WHO spokesman, Gregory Hartl, told AFP that according to a preliminary report, all those affected began showing symptoms between April 13 and 15. Mr Akinmade said health officials and experts from the government and aid agencies, as well as WHO epidemiologists, had arrived in Ode-Irele to search for answers. “There is no patient of the disease in any hospital and the disease has not spread beyond the town,” he said.

Australian laws should not have religious loopholes as they are, by their very nature, discriminatory.

https://www.mamamia.com.au/how-dangerous-is-ice/,"Explain to me: Is ""ice"" more dangerous than any other illegal drug?","August 28, 2015","By Nicole Lee, Flinders University Ice is the worst drug scourge Australia has faced. It is far more potent, far more dangerous, and far more addictive than any other illegal drug. – Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Liberal Party of Australia email to subscribers, August 13, 2015. “Ice” is the crystalline form of methamphetamine. The other main forms of methamphetamine are “speed” (a powder) and “base” (a paste). They all have the same chemical structure but differ in potency and purity, with ice typically three to four times stronger than speed but the purity of all forms depends on how it is made. It is worth testing the Prime Minister’s comments, made as he announced new funding for the Australian Crime Commission to tackle ice, against the evidence. Mr Abbott’s office did not respond to requests for data to support his statement. Terms like “worst” and “scourge” are subjective and not checkable, so it is not possible to test this part of the statement against a data set. But we do know that ice is not the most widely used illicit drug and the percentage of the population using has not increased over at least the last decade. However, harms have increased substantially among people already using. According to the latest population statistics, 2.1% of the population reported using methamphetamine in the 12 months prior to the survey, which was conducted in 2013. This includes people who have used once in a year and those who use every day. This statistic has remained stable for at least the last 10 years, so there does not appear to be a huge increase in new users. As a comparison, just over 10% of the population report using cannabis in the last year, 4.7% pharmaceuticals (for non-medical purposes), 2.5% ecstasy (MDMA) and 2.1% cocaine. The same data show that about half of methamphetamine users prefer ice over other forms. The proportion of users who use ice as their main form of methamphetamine has doubled since 2010 – from 22% of users to 50% of users. This suggests that regular users are switching from speed to ice. In addition, these data show that existing users are using more frequently, with a larger percentage of users reporting using weekly or daily, but a lower quantity. As a result of these changes, we have seen an increase in harms associated with methamphetamine use. It is difficult to compare drugs in terms of severity. Fewer people use ice than alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, ecstasy and pharmaceuticals for non-medical purposes; 2.1% of Australians are methamphetamine users (1% use ice), while 80% are alcohol users and 10% are cannabis users. Alcohol is still the major drug-related reason for ambulance call-outs and still results in the most deaths and illnesses every year compared to other drugs. However, the Prime Minister was not comparing ice to legal drugs like alcohol – he said it was more dangerous “than any other illegal drug”. In Victoria, there are an average of 4.7 methaphetamine-related ambulance attendances a day (3.4 of those for ice) and about 87% of those cases are transported to hospital. This is less than alcohol (34 attendances per day), benzodiazepines (8.3 attendances per day) and heroin (5.1 attendances per day). And it is similar to cannabis, with 4.4 attendances a day and around 86% transported to hospital. Among illegal drugs, heroin and other opioids are typically involved in the most deaths, even though fewer people use them compared to other substances. Methamphetamine, including “ice”, has the second-highest death rate among illegal drugs. In Australia, according to the latest accurate data, there were 101 deaths involving methamphetamine with 20% of those attributed solely to methamphetamine (the rest involved a mix of drugs) compared to 617 deaths involving heroin. However, the trend seems to signal increasing deaths with methamphetamine, while heroin deaths are projected to remain stable. One of the biggest harms from illicit drugs comes from the fact that they are illegal. Methamphetamine is manufactured using different methods and ingredients and vary widely in purity and potency depending how it is made and who makes it. The dependence potential of any drug depends on a number of factors, including the drug itself, the person who is using it and how it is used. It is difficult to get a precise measure of how “addictive” a drug is, but using methamphetamine three to four times a week or more is likely to be a sign of dependence. Among people who have used any form of methamphetamine in the last year, around 15% used at least weekly. This is higher among ice users with about 25% using weekly or more. How does this compare to other drugs? In 2007, The Lancet published a paper that compared the dependence potential of a range of drugs, including amphetamines. The paper concluded that heroin and cocaine among the illicit drugs, and tobacco, barbiturates, alcohol and benzodiazepines among the legally available drugs, are more likely to produce dependence than amphetamines. Methamphetamine is a drug that can cause substantial harms. Potency is difficult to compare between drugs, so it is not possible to confirm the accuracy of this statement. However, it is an overstatement to say that ice is far more addictive and far more dangerous than other illicit drugs. While we certainly need to address the harms associated with methamphetamine use, we should keep in mind that our most widely used drug – alcohol – still results in more harms to individuals and the community, and other illicit drugs are also associated with more harms.  Nicole Lee is Associate Professor at the National Centre for Education and Training on Addiction at Flinders University This article was originally published on The Conversation. Read the original article. Want more like this? Try these: “My darling girl, today marks 2 years since ice took you away from me.” It’s one of the cheapest illicit drugs on the market. It also has the potential to do the most damage. The hardcore drug being used by young women as a means to lose weight. This is ridiculous. The lancet paper is from 2007. The purity of ice has increased tenfold. The majority of your stats are methamphetamine based, whilst the issue here is specifically the crystalline form. There's a big difference between powder and ice. This article seems to focus on harm to the user. What of harm to those around them? Talking to a friend who is in the police force, he would rather deal with a Herron addict than ice addict any day. He tells me that ice users are far more violent, more likely to have delusions and are far harder to get under control and far harder to get safley into a hospital. From his perspective, ice is a far worse drug than anything else he has to deal with, not because of its addictive was, or potential of overdose, but because of the way it causes the user to behave and the danger many users pose to those around them.","Aug 27, 2015 ...

https://www.mamamia.com.au/sam-bloom-paraplegic/,"""I saw an old photo of myself and started sobbing. It was like looking at someone who's died.""","September 9, 2018","When Sam Bloom fell from a rickety balcony while holidaying in Thailand with her family in 2013, her world changed forever. Paralysed from the chest down, the active life she’d led before seemed lost, leaving her deeply depressed at the prospect of a bleak future. But in her darkest days came hope – Penguin – a wobbly-headed magpie chick who’d tumbled out of her nest. When no veterinarian would take Penguin in, Sam and her family carefully gathered her up and carried her to their own home. Suddenly Sam felt she had a purpose, driven by her instincts as a nurse and mother to bring the little bird back to health, and in doing so, finding the focus she needed to move forward in her own recovery. Her story became a best-selling book – Penguin Bloom – and is soon to be made into a film starring and produced by Naomi Watts. Here, Sam shares a ‘real and honest’ account of how the new realities she’s been forced to face following her accident have changed her, but how little by little, she’s rediscovering her sense of self and setting new sporting goals along the way. I’ve never felt more vulnerable in my life as I did straight after the accident. I had no control over anything and had to put all my trust in those around me. Visualisation helped me lot. When I was flown back to Australia I’d lost a lot of weight and I was on an air mattress because I had a pressure sore from lying on the spinal board for so long – something that shouldn’t have happened. The air mattress would make this swooshing sound so I’d close my eyes and picture myself back in India – this beautiful arid place – with no-one else around me. In the hospital back home I would just cry when the nurses would wheel me into the shower. I was a complete basket case. But I’d sit under the water and imagine myself surfing again. Being paralysed means a lot more than not being able to walk. It’s the loss of independence and control of your life and your body; the loss of spontaneity. We used to do what we wanted with no plan but we can’t do that now.     A post shared by Sam Bloom (@samjbloom) on Jun 8, 2014 at 11:02pm PDT  My husband Cam went away last year for a job. I was lying in bed and I looked at an old profile pic of myself on Facebook and just started sobbing. It was like looking at someone you love, but they’ve died. It was really full-on and I felt like I was losing it. I often used to think the real me died in Thailand. I was grieving – I still am. I was so bored for the first year after the accident. Before, I was active every day, independent and doing mum things. Boredom became my worst enemy, but when Penguin came into our lives it became her and me every day. Suddenly, I had something to do. She was with me all the time and was really good company. We would sing and chat to each other. Penguin listened to all of my complaints and she never accidentally said anything thoughtless in response to me. Listen: Mia Freedman interviews Cameron and Sam Bloom about their remarkable story. Post continues after audio. 
 I was never really a stressed person before. If the kids were driving me nuts I’d go for a mountain bike, run, or surf, and I’d be cool afterwards, but I don’t have that escape like I used to. I’m essentially surrounded by people all the time, so now when I need to be on my own, I get in the car and drive to Palm Beach and just look at the surf and chill out listening to music. I used to do everything for my kids, but when I wasn’t home for seven months they had to learn to be really independent. They are so resilient though, and as a family it’s brought us closer together. I remember Noah (15) telling me he realises now how fragile life can be. The boys are different now – more compassionate. They’re more aware of people suffering because they’ve been exposed to it. I certainly don’t think I’m the same person I was before the accident. I struggle to feel good about my body because three quarters of it doesn’t work. I don’t wake up in the morning saying ‘awesome, what am I going to do today?’ and I’m not as happy or as easy-going as I used to be. I guess I have a new identity now. I’ve always loved sport and exercise, so I kayak and surf and go to the gym – I can still do some of the things I love. I’ve grown up by the beach and always found it very calming. I took up kayaking after the accident, which was so good for me mentally and physically. In 2015 I got on the Australian ParaCanoe team, but last year I lost out on the opportunity to go to the Olympics, which I was gutted about. I had a purpose and a goal, and after missing out I thought, what am I supposed to do now?     5 years ago my life as I loved it changed forever. I was told it takes 2 years to ‘get over it’ whatever that means. By far the biggest challenges of living with a spinal cord injury is the mental anguish not the physical inability to move more than half your body. Feeling trapped and unable to do things for myself has been soul destroying. But with the ongoing love and support from my close family and friends I’ve been able to find some inner peace and still enjoy my love of the water. @blackmoresaustralia A post shared by  Sam Bloom (@samjbloom) on Jan 7, 2018 at 3:12pm PST  I got a letter from Julian Wilson’s mum (he’s the number three surfer in the world!). She’s super cool and told me to get back out there and try surfing again, so I did. I was in a competition a month ago to get onto the Australian adaptive team. My goal is to make the team, then get to the ISA World Adaptive Surfing Championship. Something many people don’t know about being paralysed is that it can mean you’re in constant pain. It’s so cruel. You could be stabbing me in the leg and I wouldn’t know about it, but every day I wake up in pain, which gets worse throughout the day. My feet are on fire, my bum is on fire – it’s like I’ve been stung all over by blue bottles and the jellyfish are wrapped around me. At the break line around my chest it’s hyper-sensitive too, so I’m never comfortable. The pain can make me grumpy and sad, but I try to keep it inside. Exercise helps, and I take medication – an anti-epilepsy drug – but it’s not that great for you. When I first started taking it I felt so out of it. I recently started taking medicinal marijuana. It takes the edge off and you certainly sleep well, but it’s crazy how hard it is to get, even though it’s all legal. I was taking CBD but what I’m taking now contains THC. It’s in oil form and you squirt about half a millimetre in your mouth. You don’t experience a high from it because of the way the THC reacts with the CBD. I was really fortunate to find a GP that was approved to prescribe it for me as it’s made a big difference. I’m also writing another book, due out next year. Bradley Trevor Greive (our Penguin Bloom co-author) is in LA and he’s helping me write it. We talk a lot on Skype and I tell him everything that’s going through my head. Penguin Bloom: the bird that saved a family. Post continues after video. 
  I sent him my notes from after the accident. They were crazy – so full of hate and sadness – but they were kind of my journal. I was angry at missing my old life, missing me, and feeling jealous of watching people live a normal life. It’s weird re-reading them now. I’m not as angry as I was back then. I used to cry a lot more – I just found it all so overwhelming. Now I’m just trying to focus on the future and what I can do, instead of what I can’t. The aim of the book is to help people. It basically picks up where Penguin Bloom left off and will share my take on facing and overcoming adversity. I hope telling my story might be helpful to others, and show them they’re not alone. That would definitely be a positive out of all this. We’re also incredibly excited to have our story told through a movie. Producers Naomi Watts, Bruna Papandrea and Emma Cooper are extraordinary women and I know they will do a fantastic job. Follow @samjbloom and @penguinthemagpie

The NY Daily News reports stars at the invitation-only event included Kathy Griffin, Kelly Osbourne, Sarah Jessica Parker, Whoopi Goldberg, Howard Stern, Barbara Walters, Geraldo Rivera, Diane Sawyer, Kathie Lee, Hoda Kotb and Andy Cohen, along with moguls Barry Diller, Donald Trump and Steve Forbes. Hugh Jackman sang “Quiet Please, There’s a Lady on Stage” from his musical The Boy From Oz, and Broadway actress Audra McDonald also performed. Joan Rivers wrote in her 2012 book “I Hate Everyone … Starting With Me” that she hoped for “a huge showbiz affair with lights, cameras, action” and “Hollywood all the way”. Instead of a rabbi talking, Rivers asked for “Meryl Streep crying, in five different accents” and “a wind machine so that even in the casket my hair is blowing just like Beyoncé’s”.
 Former Speaker’s aide James Ashby has told 60 Minutes he was told by Federal Education Minister Christopher Pyne if he went public with the assistance Pyne offered him he would call him a “pathological liar”. Mr Ashby said he approached MP Wyatt Roy, to ask for advice about how to handle the sexual harassment he had received from Peter Slipper. Roy put him in touch with Christopher Pyne, who offered then to find him legal assistance and a job in state politics. 60 Minutes reports Mr Pyne says he has ” no specific knowledge of the allegations made by Mr Ashby and the first I knew that he was suing Mr Slipper was when I read it in the newspapers.”
 Just days out from learning his fate, Oscar Pistorius has lost his cool with journalists in his home town of Pretoria, telling a reporter he deserved privacy. The Sunday Times newspaper reports Pistorius was trembling with anger when asked how he was doing. “How can you ask me that? Do you really have the audacity to ask me how I am doing at this point in my life? What I am going through and feeling… I really cannot deal with this right now.” The story speculates that recent property sales of his assets are a revenue-raising venture to raise further legal fees in the event he is found guilty when the judge hands down her verdict on either Thursday or Friday evening. Pistorius has pleaded not guilty to murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine’s Day last year after shooting her through a closed bathroom door. He claims he thought she was an intruder.
 The home of the parents of conjoined twins Faith and Hope, who died in May this year, has been ransacked by thieves — causing thousands of dollars of damage and memorials to the twins destroyed.

Jennifer Ann Whalen pleaded guilty to obtaining the pills from an online site in Europe for her daughter aged 16. Her daughter suffered stomach pain upon taking the drugs and ended up in hospital. The mother said she bought the pills as there was no local clinic available to perform an abortion and her daughter did not have health insurance to cover a hospital abortion, The Huffington Post reports.

Sierra Leone has ordered its citizens not to leave the areas around their homes for three days from September 19, in an attempt to prevent new infections and assist health workers track down people suffering from the disease. Cars will be banned from the streets and health workers will go door-to-door searching for Ebola victims that families may have hidden, reports The Australian.  The deputy information minister of Sierra Leone said that the three-day shutdown would make it easier for medical workers to trace suspected cases.
 The World Health Organization has launched a report on suicide — saying it’s a major public health problem “too often shrouded in taboo”. One person dies every 40 seconds from suicide around the world, and the WHO wants to reduce the rate of suicide by 10% by 2020. The organisation also criticized the reporting of suicide in the media, citing the details revealed about the death of Hollywood actor Robin Williams.

   The Advertiser reports one in five South Australian teachers want to bring back, or are undecided about, corporal punishment. Nine percent are in favour of bringing back the cane and 12 percent “neither agree nor disagree” with the idea, according to a UniSA survey. The study coincides with a campaign by charity Save the Children, calling for a nationwide ban on corporal punishment. Save the Children has challenged all states to follow NSW, Victoria, Tasmania and the ACT, who have banned corporal punishment in all schools.

 A report in the Archives of Disease in Childhood has shown that babies who cry excessively may be linked to anxious mothers. Researchers found that mums-to-be who experience stress, worry or panic attacks before becoming pregnant are more than twice as likely to report that their child cried ‘excessively’. The study found a mother’s production of stress hormones during pregnancy may cross the placenta and affect the development of a child’s brain. The Daily Mail reports, however, that women need to be careful in taking research like this to heart. Dr Harriet Hiscock warned against increasing “a mother’s day of worry by blaming her for her infant’s crying.”
[post_snippet id=324408] Bring back the cane! Kids these days need a consequence that sticks and is personal. It would keep kids accountable and would be a tool in teaching kids self control which a lot of them lack these days. Ive seen the kids in my children's high school and how they treat the teachers with such disrespect. For the newish teacher who says she wouldn't be able to fit in giving kids the cane:- that wouldn't be your job. It would be the principals job not yours. I'm a mother of three late teens and two small children and I am totally agreeable with bring back something that kids would be scared of getting for their behaviour. You do the crime you do the time.I know that there would be many parents poo hooing what im saying because they fear their child getting hurt but if they knew what their kids were really getting up to when they aren't around then they would probably cane them themselves!I know i would have thought twice about bullying someone or being rude to authority if i knew i was going to get the cane. I just asked my 19 yr old the question and he said heck yeah mum if i knew i was going to get the cane id have been a different kid at school. There you go people! Schools may not actually have to cane most kids when they know it is a very real possibility of getting it. As a newish teacher I couldn't think of anything worse than adding something else to do to my day like caning. Plus it's exhausting I spent my whole day today hounding three students to just do their work. It's fascinating to me that if I don't go slightly nuts to try to get some learning into these children somehow I'm deficient. I love the job really I do but some days when I'm up against kids who really don't want to learn I wonder why I have to force them? Or risk being a bad teacher.","Sep 7, 2014 ...

https://www.mamamia.com.au/donald-trump-transcript/,"""If you can look into it."" Details of Trump's call to the Ukraine have been released, & more in news in 5.","September 25, 2019","– With AAP. US President Donald Trump repeatedly pushed for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, according to a transcript of the phone conversation released by the White House. On Wednesday, the White House released a five-page summary of the phone conversation which took place on July 25 between Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky. During the conversation, Trump also asked Zelensky to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and US Attorney General William Barr on the issue. The president of the United States has betrayed our country. That’s not a political statement—it’s a harsh reality, and we must act. He is a clear and present danger to the things that keep us strong and free. I support impeachment. — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 25, 2019  “There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it… it sounds horrible to me,” Trump says, according to the summary. During the phone call, Trump also criticised Mueller’s testimony from the day before and raised the possibility of looking into the US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. “I would like you to do us a favour though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike… I guess you have one of your wealthy people… the server, they say Ukraine has it,” he said according to the transcript. “There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the attorney general call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it,” he added. “Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.” The release of the transcript comes a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared the President had betrayed his oath of office and announced she is opening a formal impeachment inquiry. “The fact is that the President of the United States, in breach of his constitutional responsibilities, has asked a foreign government to help him in his political campaign at the expense of our national security, as well as undermining the integrity of our elections,” she said after the transcript was released Wednesday. “That cannot stand. He will be held accountable. No one is above the law.” She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see! https://t.co/1tQG6QcVKO — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019  Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg says she was not surprised to have been the subject of a tweet from US President Donald Trump and says she “of course” took his tweet to have been meant sarcastically. Trump tweeted about Thunberg for the first time after reportedly watching video of Thunberg giving an emotional speech at a UN summit on climate change in New York. “She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!” Trump tweeted on Monday. Thunberg was visibly angry in her speech earlier in the day as she sounded the alarm about climate change and accused world leaders of inaction, stealing her childhood and future. Asked about the president’s tweet on a Scandinavian talk show, Thunberg said: “You can interpret it in many different ways, but I knew that at some time he is probably going to say something about me.” “It doesn’t make any difference in a way,” Thunberg added in an excerpt released on Wednesday of the Norwegian-Swedish television production Skavlan, which will air in full on Friday. Asked if she “read any sarcasm” into Trump’s tweet, Thunberg replied: “Of course I do, but of course he was going to write that.” Trump and Thunberg did not meet in person, though they were both in New York for the UN General Assembly this week. Trump walked past the 16-year-old activist on Monday, appearing not to notice her behind him as he addressed reporters. Thunberg has also changed her Twitter biography, using a portion of Trump’s quote about her. The ACT has become the first Australian jurisdiction to legalise the possession, use and cultivation of small amounts of cannabis https://t.co/KIIMuD9e5d — ABC Canberra (@abccanberra) September 25, 2019  Possessing and growing cannabis for personal use will be legal in the nation’s capital next year. The ACT will become the first state or territory in Australia to allow cannabis use, with residents over 18 permitted to possess up to 50 grams and grow two plants. The ACT’s Legislative Assembly passed a private member’s bill from Labor backbencher Michael Pettersson on Wednesday, but residents will have to wait until the law comes into effect on January 31, 2020 before they can light up. The bill would require cannabis not to be used near children and kept out of their reach. Driving under the influence would stay illegal, as would growing it in community gardens or hydroponically and while each Canberran can grow two plants, there would be a limit of four per household. On Wednesday, Chief Minister Andrew Barr suggested Commonwealth prosecutors had been pressured by the federal government to revise their legal advice to the ACT government. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions initially provided advice to the ACT on what defences would be available to those charged under Commonwealth law, but in a letter a week later said it “would not be appropriate” to give advice. Mr Barr said this raised questions of what changed between those two letters. Individual police would still be able to charge people under Commonwealth law, but Mr Barr said the ACT’s Attorney-General would intervene to defend anyone charged under federal law. Attorney-General Gordon Ramsay said it was time to treat drug addiction as a health issue rather than an issue of “right and wrong”. The government would roll out an education campaign on the new law before January. The bill’s passing comes as laws passed on Tuesday allowing the establishment of a specialised drug and alcohol court in Canberra. Mr Ramsay acknowledged that possession and growth of cannabis would remain a federal offence and the risk of prosecution was not entirely removed, but said “in practice” the laws would not apply. Mr Pettersson said a defence exists for cannabis use under Commonwealth law if the use is excused or justified by state or territory law. “Commonwealth law has been written with the express understanding that there are differences,” Mr Pettersson said. “I don’t think it’s particularly likely the Commonwealth government will try to fight this.” A review of the laws will be conducted within three years. The Liberal opposition did not support the bill, describing it as badly drafted and raising concerns it would lead to a number of “perverse outcomes”. ACT shadow attorney-general Jeremy Hanson told the assembly it would encourage more people to use cannabis, which medical professionals say would lead to increased rates of psychosis. Mr Hanson said the fact it conflicted with Commonwealth law would also be confusing for police. “This puts not only individuals at a greater level of risk but our police will be out there on the beat working in this unclear legal framework,” Mr Hanson said. Federal Attorney-General Christian Porter said the bill was a matter for the ACT, but where Commonwealth laws applied they remained enforceable. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said any problems with Commonwealth law were a matter for the attorney-general, but the Morrison government did not support legalising cannabis for recreational use. Mr Barr said the government had consulted with ACT Policing. An online group of fathers named ‘Domestic Violence Against Men’ has urged more than 19,000 members to abduct their children in a coordinated strike that would reduce the ability of law enforcement to respond. #7NEWS https://t.co/j4nUZ96wEn — 7NEWS Australia (@7NewsAustralia) September 25, 2019  A post in an online group of fathers has urged more than 19,000 members to abduct their children in a coordinated strike that would reduce the ability of law enforcement to respond. The group, Domestic Violence Against Men, posted the call to action asking Australian fathers to ”grab their kids” on December 1 and take them interstate. The September 12 post, made by an administrator of the Facebook group reads: “On the 1st of December every father must grab their kids & run to another state, then report the mother for sexual abuse.” Fathers were urged in a subsequent post to run as far as they could and to make false claims about the mother. The following day an administrator posted that the mass abduction would attract media coverage. “We are going to make headlines no matter what it takes, no one gives a shite about how we are affected or why we #suicide,” he said. A later post says: “Truth is, no father has it in them to take a child away from a mother yet a mother will do it & doesn’t give a … who it effects.” The page says it is a voice for silenced male victims of domestic violence. It encourages members to vent on the site rather than suicide. Following the announcement of the parliamentary inquiry into family law, several members wrote warnings to Prime Minister Scott Morrison of an epidemic of suicide and violence if the inquiry failed to do what was right by them. The Domestic Violence Against Men page owner alleges he is a victim of domestic violence and claims he has been falsely accused of committing domestic violence. When alerted to the post urging mass child abduction, an Australian Federal Police spokesperson said they were aware of a number of groups that advocated for all sides of family law matters. “The AFP encourages all parties to resolve Family Law issues in accordance with the best interests of the children involved and the law,” she said. Queensland police said they would not tolerate the breaking of any laws and anyone who chooses to do so would be held accountable. 1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732) Lifeline 13 11 14 Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the Supreme Court ruling against him has hindered his attempt to get a Brexit deal but that as the law currently stands, the United Kingdom would leave the European Union on October 31. https://t.co/Yt9ubA9goN — 10 News First (@10NewsFirst) September 24, 2019  A defiant Prime Minister Boris Johnson is flying home from New York after the Supreme Court ruled he had unlawfully suspended parliament, with no end in sight to Britain’s deep political crisis over Brexit. Johnson is determined to lead Britain out of the European Union on October 31, with or without an exit agreement, but most members of parliament are equally determined to prevent a so-called “no-deal Brexit” scenario. The House of Commons, where Johnson has no majority, will reconvene at 11.30am local time on Wednesday after the Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that his decision to suspend it for five weeks was unlawful and therefore null and void. It is unclear exactly what will happen next. Johnson has rejected calls from some political opponents to resign. The main opposition Labour Party is itself deeply split over Brexit, and appears to be vacillating about whether to launch a motion of no-confidence to try and bring Johnson down. Johnson has repeatedly said his preferred Brexit outcome would be to agree an exit deal with the EU’s 27 other members before the October 31 deadline, and that he was hopeful he would achieve that. However, EU negotiators say he has made no new proposals capable of breaking the deadlock over the issue of how to manage the border between Ireland, an EU member, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, after Brexit. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons and an ardent advocate of Brexit, was reported by British newspapers to have said during a conference call with Johnson and other cabinet members on Tuesday that the Supreme Court had carried out a “constitutional coup”. Johnson himself was combative after the ruling, telling reporters in New York on Tuesday that he strongly disagreed with the Supreme Court justices, and complaining that there were many people trying to thwart Brexit against the will of the people. On the other side of the divide, one of Johnson’s own former cabinet members, Amber Rudd, said it would be irresponsible for the government to cast the ruling as an anti-Brexit move when Johnson’s defence all along was that his decision to suspend parliament in the first place had nothing to do with Brexit. Former minister Dominic Grieve, an influential member of parliament and an anti-Johnson rebel within the ruling Conservative Party, accused the prime minister of behaving “like a bull in a china shop”. “My judgment is that there’s only one way out and that is to have a second referendum, because otherwise we’re going to carry on going round in circles. But he’s entitled to put other ideas forward if he thinks he’s got them,” Grieve said. “He says he wants to get a deal but there’s no evidence he’s even started negotiating a deal with the EU and it’s quite clear that the House of Commons and parliament will not accept leaving without an agreement because it’s so damaging for the future of our country.” Before the suspension, parliament had passed a law requiring Johnson to ask the EU to push back the October 31 deadline if no exit deal was agreed by October 19. Asked by reporters on Tuesday how he planned to overcome that obstacle, Johnson simply ignored the question and insisted Brexit would take place on October 31, come what may.   If you're still in support of Trump after all the revelations of his presidency, culminating in these latest; do me a favour and give your moral compass a good hard whack.

Sure, I got side-tracked sometimes with philosophical discoveries, but I was still making progress towards my goals. I got my degree, and worked effectively in my field. I never went to school or work while stoned. That said, I certainly used pot on my own time. Cannabis allowed me to chill and appreciate the simple moments of my not-so-hectic (though I thought it was) twenty-something life. ""I loved the stuff — and it certainly loved me."" Image via iStock.  A high from weed was sort of like a pair of rose-colored glasses and a shoulder rub, to me. It made everything feel just a little bit lighter. Fast forward 15 years, throw in three kids, a house, a husband, and some part-time writing, and, well… there’s no time or space for my former pot-smoking ways. In fact, I’ve had a lonely bag of weed (given to me by a friend) sitting in the back corner of our junk drawer for over two years. Two years! Back in the day, that shit wouldn’t have lasted two days. Obviously, finding the right time for “Mummy to get high” is no easy feat. Especially since I have a tween who stays up almost as late as we do now. Wil Anderson on medical marijuana. Post continues below.  Lately, the bag of weed in the junk drawer has been calling my name. I know I enjoy smoking weed, yet there it sits. It sits there, unsmoked, because; Therefore, it just never happens. But yesterday, I said “Fuck this! Weed and I will reunite — and it will be today.” So, I dropped the kids off at a play date a few streets over, deciding if they needed me I could walk back over (with shades on) to get them. I then came back home and rolled myself a small one. Not quite a “wake and bake,” but close enough! I stepped out into the backyard, with the BBQ lighter and my tiny little spliff. I only took a few drags, not sure how I would handle it, and not wanting to get too altered, after all these years. Within moments, the rose-colored glasses were on and the shoulder rub was beginning… It felt damn good — a bit nostalgic, even. I immediately noticed how fresh the air smelled, with its fragrant summer aromas. I went into the house, caught a glimpse of my scruffy self in the mirror, and decided I needed a quick freshening up. On went a black maxi dress, some lip gloss, and a dab of the patchouli oil I’d forgotten I had. And then… THEN something happened that was absolutely out of this world: I cleaned! ""I cleaned!"" Image via iStock.  I was inspired, perhaps for the first time ever, and all I wanted to do was clean. So, I scrubbed. I organized. I wiped smudges and dirt that I’d overlooked for years. I folded and straightened, like an artist at work. Nothing could pull me away from cleaning, not even my laptop. Now, for those of you who don’t know me — which is all of you, because I have written this anonymously! — I HATE cleaning. But two tokes from a tiny little joint made cleaning fun! It. Made. Cleaning. Fun. Which, actually, really sucks. Because, inevitably, the buzz wore off and normalcy returned. So, now I have to un-know the joy that my rendezvous with a dube brought to me and to the monotony of my daily mum-chores. I have to un-know it because I can’t justify smoking pot for fun on weekday mornings. I’m not a hippie, I’m a housewife, right?! But… perhaps I could be both? Can a suburban housewife not also be a hippie at heart? Wouldn’t “Weed Wednesdays” be pretty fun? Every Wednesday I could clean my house in a euphoric haze of creative organization. Man, I really like the sound of that! Besides, the summer is almost over, we all survived, so I certainly deserve a nice pair of rose-colored glasses and a massage to celebrate!

https://www.mamamia.com.au/henry-hammond-facebook/,"A few years ago, Henry Hammond was a smiling new dad. Yesterday, he was charged with murder.","May 28, 2019","With AAP.  Photos of Henry Richard Hammond just a few years ago show a handsome, clean-shaven, normal young man. Privately educated at Oxford Falls Grammar School and from a good family, his profile is littered with his gorgeous young sons and his smiling fiancé. “Congratulations Henry, you’re an amazing dad,” wrote his friends. The 27-year-old was a barber, and regularly offered his friends discounts online to make their chop cheaper. He played the saxophone and liked knitting. He looked happy, normal, in love. But gradually, a different image of Hammond emerged online. Dishevelled, sitting in gutters smoking cigarettes, and posting manic scary photos. Over the years, he also posted sporadic links to articles about marijuana, magic mushrooms’ healing properties, and petitions for cannabis for medicinal use. The strange online presence became more frequent in 2017. 
His friends noticed his changing appearance. “Henry that is so weird.” “What happened to the barber in you Henry?” That Facebook profile hasn’t been touched since August 2018. In April 2019, a new one emerged with Nordic mythology symbols and an even more dishevelled photo of Hammond. “I was fertilized and grew wise; From a word to a word I was led to a word,” reads his bio. ‘Single’ reads his relationship status. A third profile was created in May. All three remain live, a strange progression that shows a man whose life was unravelling. A man who is accused of murdering 25-year-old Courtney Herron in a Melbourne park last Friday night, or Saturday morning. Courtney's body was found by dog walkers in the city's inner north. She'd been the victim of a ""horrendous bashing,"" Detective Inspector Andrew Stamper told the Herald Sun. Women and violence: the hidden numbers. Post continues after video. The court heard Hammond is also homeless. He appeared in court shoeless and with a black eye, and was told his case would be adjourned for four months so he could be assessed. His lawyer told the court he had a number of mental health issues; possible delusional disorder, possible autism spectrum disorder, and historical diagnosis of ADHD. Bernie Balmer wanted it known this would affect his time in custody. ""It's a tragic and complex situation,"" Balmer told AAP. Friends of Hammond told The Age they've avoided him for the past few years. His lifestyle choices weren't for them. ""Apparently at one point he thought he was Jesus,"" one former friend told the publication. ""He became psychologically dislodged."" Colleagues told the Herald Sun he started heavily abusing drugs after his fiancé left him. On the night in question he was reportedly with Herron at a gathering in the city. They left together just hours before her death, reported The Age. Courtney's devastated mother and grandmother were photographed screaming over flowers that lay where her body was found. Not until September 16 will they have the chance to hear why the man accused of her murder allegedly did what he did. The police are also devastated, it's the fourth woman murdered in a public place in Melbourne in less than a year. ""Every time I hear about a woman being attacked – for me as a man – it gives me some pause for reflection about what it is in our community that makes men think it's OK to attack women, or take what they want from women,"" Assistant Commissioner Luke Cornerlius told the media, The Age reports. ""We as a society need to take an opportunity to reflect on how men view women in our community, and... tragedies where women have been attacked and suffered harm at the hands of men,"" he said. "" Violence against women is absolutely about men’s behaviour, it’s not about women’s behaviour,"" he reiterated. A GoFundMe has been set up for Courtney's funeral. It's currently at the time of writing this at $8000, with a goal of $10,000. You can donate here.

Accused killer of Melbourne woman, Courtney Herron, appears in court. Courtney Herron's friend says the system let her down before she was murdered. Another woman has been found dead in Melbourne. Police say it's ""not about women’s behaviour."" Can we stop making excuses for a murderer? This isn't his story, its Courtney's. Mental health and drug use are widely spread issues that certainly deserve more funding and attention. But this doesn't have to be the story that we use to examine that. Imagine being that poor girl's family and having to read all this tripe about how the system just failed this man. Because he's white and was good looking. He's a murderer. He ruined his own life by murdering her. The tragedy is that she's gone, not that he is going to face consequences. Once upon a time governments were willing to treat people with mental health issues. Then they realized it was cheaper to put them ""back in the community"".Now we see the consequences of that. My brother had schizoaffective disorder and was one of those who lived in suitable supported accomodation who was “rehabilitated” to live in the community. A “not for profit” took over the government service. He lived in a wonderful home for years - by home I mean uni college style dorm accomodation - private room, meals provided, activities, friendship - a “job”. Fast forward the “not for profit” funding is based on higher payments for getting the long term institutionalised living independent. Even if that means not taking medication, not eating heathy food,spending all money on cigarettes, becoming psychotic and smashing upHouses next door, living in filth-his Megs make him wet the bed and his aim is poor do the floor disintegrated due to the urine. He smelt really really bad so people took a wide birth. But they got their bonus because he was “ rehabilitated”. Until he almost died from accidentally overdosing on his already inappropriate medication. Was in a coma and found on the floor. No one rang his next of kin due to “privacy” and we only found out because some friends were visiting a relative in the same room. We live in another state so it is difficult to keep in contact when he kept swapping his phone for cigarettes.After an extended hospital stay They sent him home alone again where they decided it was not safe for him to self medicate- so people came multiple times a day- but he was never home-too busy wandering the streets picking up cigarette butts so he missed his medication.Consequently he dissolved into scary violent psychosis. Smashed houses, bank tellers and bakery workers. At this stage they asked if I would like to have him move in with me. My violent older brother who killed my cat as a teen- smashed my bike and toys and sexually abused me ( he was a young teen - I was a 2-4 year old). I have young kids. It was never going to happen. But I did fly down home, and really push for more suitable housing. They tried a group home but he still needed to be independent. They we managed to get him into a proper home again with support, food and cleaning. I don’t think it is even government funded - more a hostel run by a top man who took over from his dad who ran it for decades before him. They use the NDIS to fund people to do his cleaning , take him in activities and bath him. They provide the food and emotional support and financial management. They have to share a room and it’s not run by health professionals but it is stability. He was supported through his court cases by the man who runs it. He is now on much less medication, can function better as a human,can now visit me on the mainland and I know he is safe and happy. We need to have better care of vulnerable people.","May 28, 2019 ... ... posted sporadic links to articles about marijuana, magic mushrooms' healing properties, and petitions for cannabis for medicinal use.",17,1337

https://www.mamamia.com.au/cwa-scones/,"Whatever you do, don't ask a CWA lady about scones.","June 4, 2015","NO ONE MENTION THE SCONES. When ABC News Breakfast invited Grandma Noela from the Country Women’s Association on the show, they were probs expecting a nice chat about scones and tea, and crochet lap rugs. Maybe they’d get a hug that smelt like talcum powder and mothballs. Then they could swap tips on spongecake. After all, the association is turning 70 and every milestone needs cake, right? But Noela had other ideas. Because Noela is a powerful lobbyist. Noela is the Frank Underwood of Grannies. And Noela don’t wanna talk about no scones or jam or god damn cream because NOELA FOUGHT TO GET OUT OF THE KITCHEN AND NOW EVERYONE WANTS TO PUT HER BACK THERE. Ahem. Basically, Noela MacLeod is a badass feminist granny who just wants everyone to stop with the scones. The National President of the Country Womens Association of Australia was all that in an interview where she smacked down hosts Michael Rowlands and Virginia Trioli for asking her about baking. “I’m not discussing scones” she said.  “Because the national body is neither a caterer or a fundraiser.” Because the CWA actually does a whole lot of other more important stuff. And, to be fair, the excellent hosts asked her about such works.  They lobby political parties, raise money for charity support victims of domestic violence, lobby for environmental causes and they are CAMPAIGNING TO LEGALISE CANNABIS for medical purposes. “We listen to what’s happening at grassroots level” she told the hosts, YEP. These Nanna’s are down with grass roots.   Release a cookbook and suddenly all anyone wants to talk about is cake. She told Mamamia it’s “always the first thing the press hone in on”, and she’s had a gutful. “It’s irrelevant. The scones are irrelevant. We are first and foremost a lobby group.” A Grandma to 21, Noala has been National President since August 2012 and says she works over 40 hours a week in the role, none of which includes baking. A member for over four decades, Noela has a history of dropping truth bombs on anyone that goes into scone territory. At last years National Rural Health Alliance, she says she was briefed on how to speak to politicians correctly. But when she at last met with one, in her lobbyist role, the first thing he said was: “Did you bring the scones?'” “I said ‘You have just made a sexist and inappropriate remark’ and I sat down.”   She says she makes it clear before all interviews that she is not prepared to discuss tea and scones. “The only thing I will discuss is our cookbook, the profits of which are going towards a nursing grant for rual nand remote nurses” she says. She’s also a feminist. “I think anyone who fights for women’s issues is a feminist.  But I still like the door opened for me.” She also wouldn’t tell us her age.  “My age is irrelevant to what I do” she said. Touche. Go Noela. Keep on doing your thang, grrl. She's awesome! I love seeing strong older women working hard for change at an age when a lot of people treat them with little respect for their views or their experience. Great work. Most Sydney folk only know of the CWA because of the scones from the Royal Easter Show. Yes, there is more to the CWA than scones, but that is a part of it, just like the political lobbying, they should be talked about equally. It wasn't as if the whole interview was about scones, it was a well rounded interview. But hey, the CWA also stands for Chicks With Attitude. And Noela sure has some 'tude.","Jun 4, 2015 ... ... support victims of domestic violence, lobby for environmental causes and they are CAMPAIGNING TO LEGALISE CANNABIS for medical purposes.",10,611

Stop what you’re doing, examine the shape above, and tell us: is it a circle? Your answer will most likely fall into one of two camps:
(1) “Yeahhh… close enough.”
(2) “Ah, no way. Look at those edges.” For the purposes of this exercise there’s no wrong or right answer. However, according to psychology expert Dr Ben Ambridge your response does reveal something quite specific about your personality — and that’s your political ideology. In a new study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Dr Ambridge showed participants a range of slightly altered shapes. It was straightforward exercise, but the responses appeared to reflect the subjects’ “differences in sensitivity to deviance.” Watch: Regardless of your politics, here are 5 things you need to know about finance. (Post continues after video.) Those who were willing to accept the flaws and still see each shape for what it was — i.e. the “Yes, that’s a circle” crew — were more likely to be of a liberal persuasion, strongly supporting topics like marriage equality, legalisation of medical marijuana and aid for the homeless. In other words, they were more accepting of different or disadvantaged groups in society. Alternatively, those who were a little less forgiving of the imperfections — “No, there’s no way that’s a circle” — exhibited more conservative beliefs. (Post continues after gallery.) They were more likely to support the protection of business owners’ rights, having a strong military, and punishing wrongdoers, even for more low-level crimes. Whether or not you think it’s an accurate measure, there’s no denying it’s a much quicker ‘political personality’ test than some of the multi-question quizzes you can find online in the lead up to an election.

https://www.mamamia.com.au/mother-cannabis-crash/,Wednesday's news in under 5 minutes.,"September 1, 2015","We’ve rounded up all the latest stories from Australia and around the world – so you don’t have to go searching.   A NSW mother has admitted that she smoked three or four “cones” of cannabis on the day she crashed a car she was driving, killing her two-year-old daughter and injuring her 11-month-old son. The 20-year old woman’s two-year old daughter was sitting in the front passenger seat of the Nissan Pulsar with a normal seat belt when it crashed about 55 kilometres north of Scone, about 7pm on August 17. Fairfax Media reports the woman was charged with dangerous driving occasioning death, dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, negligent driving occasioning death, negligent driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, driving while suspended and driving with a passenger between six months and four years unrestrained. Newcastle Local court heard she made admissions to having smoked three to four “cones” of cannabis through a “bong” about 10am on the day of the collision. Magistrate Steven Jackson granted the woman bail on the condition she not drive a motor vehicle and reside at either a home in Aberdeen or Ronald McDonald House, where her 11-month old son is in intensive care.     Ruth Robinson, the partner of 26-year-old Jay Cerin, has spoken of how he was a good person who wouldn’t hurt anyone just days after police found him dead on the bedroom floor of his unit in Sydney’s west. “I’ve known Jay since I was 12, he was a kind man, he had a heart of gold,” she said of the Mount Druitt man. “He wasn’t involved in drugs. He wanted a family. We were planning on having a baby. He couldn’t wait to be a dad.” Mr Cerin’s half-brother Trent Errington and Mr Errington’s girlfriend of one month, Rhiannon Bloodsworth, were arrested and refused bail over the murder. They had been staying with Mr Cerin in his Penrith unit in the lead up to the murder. Fairfax Media reports he had been tied up, stabbed and had bleach poured down his throat.   The fire also hospitalised the boy’s father, one-year-old sister and five-year-old brother. Neighbours smashed their way through the flames but were unable to rescue 30-year-old Crystal Cartledge or her three-year-old son Baileigh. The four finalists in New Zealand’s public competition to design what could be the country’s new national flag have been revealed — but the reception within New Zealand has not been overwhelming. Twitter exploding with negative comments: “Has this entire process just been one long elaborate practical joke? That’s the only way to explain the ‪#NZflag shortlist. Utterly awful,” one user wrote. All but one of the designs, which could end up replacing the existing Union Jack-emblazoned flag, uses the national silver fern symbol. The fourth shows the curving koru Maori symbol. Two are by the same designer: Kiwi-born architect Kyle Lockwood, who lives in Melbourne. The shortlisted four designs will be put to a public  vote in November. The favourite from that poll will then go to another public vote, against the incumbent NZ flag, next year. Pope Francis has called on priests to forgive women who have had abortions — going against the usual hardline view in the Catholic Church. In Catholicism, abortion is viewed as such a grave sin that it can punished with excommunication. In most countries, only a bishop can approve forgiveness for abortion. “I have decided, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to concede to all priests for the Jubilee Year the discretion to absolve of the sin of abortion those who have procured it and who, with contrite heart, seek forgiveness for it,” he said. The change is only for the coming Jubilee Year, beginning in December. He said he was “well aware of the pressure” that some women were under to abort, adding that he had “met so many women who bear in their heart the scar of this ‘agonising and painful decision’.”   The Auschwitz Memorial in Poland is defending its decision to install outdoor mist sprinklers that has reminded visitors of gas chambers. A number of tourists who visited the former Nazi death camp have said they were stunned to see the sprinklers outside the entrance. “As a Jew who has lost so many relatives in the Holocaust, they looked like the showers that the Jews were forced to take before entering the gas chambers,” Meir Bulka told The Jerusalem Post. The Auschwitz Memorial museum responded to the controversy on its Facebook page, saying the sprinklers were installed to keep visitors cool during the August heat wave in Poland. Because thousands of people visit the memorial every day and lineups in the blazing sun are long, the sprinklers were installed “on the days of highest temperatures and removed when the temperature drops,” the museum said. “Something had to be done, as we have noticed cases of faints among people and other dangerous situations.” The museum added that the “safety and health of visitors are our priority during the period of extreme heat.” They then commented: “And one more thing. It is really hard for us to comment on some suggested historical references since the mist sprinkles do not look like showers and the fake showers installed by Germans inside some of the gas chambers were not used to deliver gas into them. Zyklon B was dropped inside the gas chambers in a completely different way – through holes in the ceiling or airtight drops in walls.” Auschwitz was the largest Nazi concentration camp during the Second World War. It is estimated that more than 1.1 million people and children, most of them Jews, were killed there between 1940 and 1945. There have been scenes of chaos in Budapest as hundreds of asylum seekers protest, demanding they be allowed to travel on to Germany. Hungarian authorities closed the train station altogether, then reopened it — but barred entry to the asylum seekers. Around 1,000 people waved tickets, clapping, booing and shouting “Germany! Germany!” outside the station. Later they sat down, staring at a police blockade erected at the entrance. About 100 police wearing helmets and wielding batons guarded the station. Dozens of asylum seekers who were inside were forced out. “I am really pissed off. Why can’t the Hungarians just let us go?,” Afghan asylum seeker Haider, 31, said after ripping up his ticket. “I worked as a translator for the US army for four years.” An announcement was earlier made at the train station that no trains would be leaving or arriving “until further notice”. The number of migrants entering Europe has reached record levels, with 107,500 arriving in July alone. The BBC reports that under the EU’s “Dublin Regulation” asylum seekers must register in the first EU member state in which they arrive. However, the protocol has been widely abused, as many of those who reached Hungary first arrived in Greece, where they failed to claim asylum. Over 12,000 Icelanders have joined a Facebook page offering to take Syrian refugees into their home, prompting the government to rethink its current policy. The page was started by Icelandic author Bryndis Bjorgvinsdottir, who encouraged her fellow countrymen to speak out in favour of those needing asylum, and within 24 hours, over 10,000 people had responded. The government had previously announced plans to take in 50 refugees from the Syrian conflict – over four million people have fled Syria since a civil war erupted there in 2011. Prime Minister Sigmund David Gunnlaugsson now says a special council comprised of several ministers will map Iceland’s resources to see how many refugees could be taken and said the government now had no fixed number. One offer, by a woman named Hekla Stefansdottir wrote: “I’m a single mother with a 6-year-old son… We can take a child in need. I’m a teacher and would teach the child to speak, read and write Icelandic and adjust to Icelandic society. We have clothes, a bed, toys and everything a child needs. I would of course pay for the airplane ticket.” Another single mother, offered her two extra rooms to a Syrian family, saying: “One of the rooms is rather large and the other is smaller … I am offering these two rooms and would of course buy beds”. Iceland has taken in 39 refugees in the past five years, 13 of them from Syria. Since 1956, the number of refugees totals just 511 people. A worldwide shortage of folic acid has given doctors concern enough to issue a warning to pregnant women to make sure they take the much-needed supplement. Under Australian regulations, manufacturers must add folic acid to wheat flour in bread as a way to protect unborn children from neural tube defects. But News Limited reports that a slowdown in production in China has meant a global shortage of folic acid, with existing supplies prioritised to vitamin manufacturers. Australia’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Baggoley said supplies of folic acid for use in supplements and infant formula would not be affected by the shortage. He has asked doctors to remind their pregnant patients to use supplements, as they may not get what they need through bread. “This global shortage of the production of folic acid means there may not be sufficient supplies to add to wheat flour for making bread for up to 12 to 18 months,” Prof Baggoley said. “Pregnant women and those planning a pregnancy should follow the NHMRC recommendations and continue to take a daily folic acid supplement at least one month before, and three months after conception.” Folate can prevent seven out of 10 cases of neural tube defects, such as spina-bifida, if taken before conception and during the first few weeks of pregnancy.

There you'll find analysis, explainers and all the results of our Mamamia Votes survey. As someone who decided to vote early, I was surprised to see just how many political parties there were on the ballot paper that I had never heard of. Going back and forth, I knew I'd personally struggle to number one to 12, so I decided to do the top-six option. And even then I found it difficult. Because dotted around the major political party boxes, there were a dozen parties that felt completely foreign to me. Party names I hadn't seen before. My fear was that I would vote in high preference for a party that didn't at all align with my views. A fear that a party masquerading themselves by an inconspicuous name, actually stood for something I would never throw my support behind. To make things less confusing for everyone who is yet to vote, here is the guide I wish I had before entering the polling booth.  But first, watch: Where the major parties stand on climate change. Post continues below. Like the title suggests, this party loves animals and essentially wants to seek out justice for them. The Animal Justice Party has a ""long-term vision for a kinder Australia"", aiming to give a political voice to animals, to pursue the vital issues of animal protection through Australia's political system and encourage political parties to adopt animal-friendly policies. The party has candidates across Australia, except for the Northern Territory. This party is on the conservative side, hoping to elect a ""Christian voice amidst the voices in parliament"". The Australian Christians Party plans to see marriage as ""only between a man and woman"", has zero tolerance for drugs, and suggests an inquiry into increasing the legal drinking age to 21.  It also focuses on religious freedom and wants there to be further ""research and scrutiny"" into whether carbon plays a role in climate change. (FYI carbon does in fact play a role in climate change, this has been proven by scientists). Last but not least, they want to restrict IVF to only married couples and stop all legislation on approving euthanasia...  All the candidates for the Australian Christians Party are from Western Australia. The Citizens Party (formerly the Citizens Electoral Council) has a predominant focus on all things economics and business. Their policies are focused on big banks, making a ""public post office a people's bank"" and rejecting the ""hysteria and alarmism"" associated with climate change.  They also want to help the population ""rise above"" addictive violent video games, dangerous drugs, mass-produced Hollywood movies and banal popular music. Yep, you read that right. They have candidates in Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and New South Wales. The Australian Democrats were once a major player in the Senate, but over the years it has dwindled in voting popularity. Their policies are fairly similar to the Greens, and overall they are calling for evidence-based governance along with integrity, truth and transparency.  There are candidates in South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland. This party aims to ""bring balance into the centre"" of politics. Their policies are focused on government and media accountability, better support for defence veterans, better biosecurity, a review into ABC funding and supporting ""responsible firearms ownership"". There are candidates for Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia and Victoria. Listen to The Quicky. Election Explainer: everything you want to know but are too afraid to ask. Post continues after audio.  Named after its head honcho, the Justice Party is run by Derryn Hinch. Policy plans include reforms to bail, parole, family courts and domestic violence law, ""more jail, less bail"", veteran affairs, regional rails and aged care worker ratios.   The party has candidates in Victoria. Another party named after someone... this is an ""anti-communism party"" that focuses on supporting Hong Kong, Uyghur and Tibetan communities, strengthening Australia's democracy and fighting against corruption, along with ""standing up to China"". There are candidates in New South Wales, South Australia and Queensland. This one is fairly self-explanatory. Basically, they're a political party aiming to establish a federal ICAC to ensure less ""corruption"" in government. This would include limiting donations to parties, real-time disclosures of donations, etc.  This party has candidates in Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland. The Federation Party is quite similar in values to that of the Australian Christians Party. As for what they stand for, they're opposed to funding and teaching gender fluidity in school and believe the pandemic response was ""totalitarian"". Also, the party takes a pro-life stance which isn't a surprise. So keep that in mind when voting...

It's a right-wing party that focuses on relaxing firearm restrictions and crocodile culling laws, hopes to lower power prices, increase access to vaping products and boosting North Queensland infrastructure. Candidates are in Queensland only. A post shared by Mamamia (@mamamiaaus) With financial backing from Climate 200, Kim Rubenstein is a law academic from Canberra who wants to make a change in government. Some of her party's policy priorities include climate change action, a federal ICAC, women's safety, establishing a First Nations' voice in parliament and a more humane refugee policy. Given her party name is 'Kim for Canberra' it makes sense that Kim is indeed only running in the ACT. This is another party that is pretty self-explanatory. They want to make cannabis legal, allow citizens to grow the drug in their gardens or homes, and make all historical personal-use cannabis criminal records expunged.  There are candidates in all states and territories. The Liberal Democrats have the belief that a smaller government will have better success than a larger government, along with an emphasis on personal responsibility and freedom.

Candidates from this party are only in New South Wales.  A post shared by Mamamia (@mamamiaaus) The Socialist Alliance is, as perhaps predicted from the name, a socialist party. That means they are heavily involved with trade unions, climate change action and student movements. For this election, the Socialist Alliance is taking a strong left-wing stance on refugee rights, and Indigenous rights. They are proposing that the banking, energy and mining sectors are nationalised - as they are pretty anti-privatisation. There are candidates in Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland. The Sustainable Australia Party is an independent community movement focusing on an, ""economically, environmentally and socially sustainable Australia"". They want to see an enforced biodiversity and native species program, free university and TAFE education, more action on climate change, dental included in Medicare and restriction on immigration to keep Australia's population under 30 million by 2050. They want to do that by reducing our immigration cap from 200,000 per annum, to just 70,000....

They are quite a divisive right-wing political party whose policies include: The party has candidates in all states and territories.  Much like the Socialist Alliance party, the Victorian Socialists are a hard left-leaning socialist group. For this federal election, they want to abolish GST, develop a more progressive tax system (which includes a wealth tax for the 'super rich'), reverse casual employment trends, changing the voting age to 16, restore universal health care, implement free dental care and negotiate a treaty to ""to respect Aboriginal sovereignty and land rights"". As the name goes, they only have candidates in Victoria.  This party's ideological focus is a combination of centrism, populism and regionalism - which basically means they sit in the middle of left and right-wing politics. They claim to fight for the everyday man and have a strong focus on rural communities. Because of this, they are keen to change tax laws in Western Australia, removing payroll and capital gains tax there.  And as expected, the party only has candidates in Western Australia.

Today marks day seven of the search for the little boy who went missing last Friday at 10.30am from his grandparent’s home in Kendall. Superintendent Paul Fehon said it was now a search rather than a rescue operation. He said if William had wandered into the bush he was unlikely to still be alive. “The experts cannot substantiate that survival in the bush would be there at this point in time,” he said. Police have formed Strike Force Rosann – which will look into known sex offenders in the area, as they still cannot rule out abduction. Yesterday they revealed they had followed a lead from shop owners in Kendall who had reported someone had asked for directions to the street where he went missing.

 Warning: This item deals with serious child abuse and may be distressing. Robert Smith, the stepfather of six-year-old Kiesha Weippeart who left the little girl to die after she was bashed by her mother has asked a court for a reduced sentence on the grounds that he helped police. Kiesha was murdered by her mother Kristi Abrahams on July 13, 2011, by means of blunt force head trauma, following years of physical abuse. During prosecution the court heard that Abrahams and Smith left Kiesha to die and did not provide any medical assistance or call an ambulance. Smith then doused her body in petrol, set her alight and buried her. He was sentenced to at least 12 years in jail for manslaughter and accessory to murder. Fairfax Media reports that Smith has appealed the severity of the sentence, claiming he was entitled to a “substantial discount” because of his offers of assistance to police.

There are reports that a yes vote could affect Australia. News Limited report that Westpac chief currency strategist Richard Holden has said a yes vote would create uncertainty and could see the Australian dollar rise 10 to 20% against the pound. “The biggest Australian exports to the UK are gold, coal, lead and alcoholic beverages, like wine – those would be the ones most likely to be affected.” He said A weak pound would also have implications for our tourism industry making trips to Australia for British tourists more expensive.
 The Prime Minister has said in a letter to broadcaster Alan Jones that he supports the legalisation of cannabis for medicinal purposes. Following NSW Premier Mike Baird’s announcement that there will be a clinical trial in that state to test the drugs’ use in pain relief. Tony Abbott said in his letter “I have no problem with the medical use of cannabis just as I have no problem with the medical use of opiates.” “If a drug is needed for a valid medicinal purpose though, and is being administered safely, there should be no question of its legality. And if a drug that is proven to be safe abroad is needed here, it should be available.
 An amazing moment when a teenager boy comes out to his mother is going viral. The boy, Hayden Smith, recorded the momentous occasion when he came out to his mother and was stunned when she revealed she too had been in a same-sex relationship. “That’s very brave of you to tell me that. Thank you for telling me,” his mother says “Can I tell you something too?” she asks her son. “I’ve had a girlfriend.” Her revelation is met with stunned silence by Hayden.

https://www.mamamia.com.au/mum-avoids-jail-over-baby-death/,Wednesday's news in 5 minutes.,"April 4, 2017","At Supreme Court for sentencing of Michelle Leask for manslaughter of daughter in ’12. Lawyer says no prison for her https://t.co/fGfJFx6nK3 — Jennine Khalik (@jennineak) April 4, 2017  When Michelle Leask noticed her bruised baby girl having trouble breathing and unable to make eye contact she wanted to take her for medical treatment. But the then 21-year-old mother was terrified into inaction, fearful of the possible violent reaction from her abusive partner, who was more concerned about concealing his small cannabis plantation than his ailing daughter’s welfare, AAP reports. Their baby, Lili Cataldo, died in hospital on May 8, 2012, and on Tuesday Leask was sentenced to five years in jail after pleading guilty to manslaughter in the Brisbane Supreme Court. But she has walked from court, with Justice Martin Burns wholly suspending the jail term, due to Leask’s vulnerability and substantial impairment stemming from the abuse inflicted by her partner and Lili’s father, Rick Cataldo. On the evening seven-week-old Lili died, Leask found the pale, unresponsive and limp baby lying on a bed behind her sleeping father. She then yelled at Cataldo. “You told him your child was not breathing,” Justice Burns said. “You wished to call an ambulance but again you were prevailed on by Cataldo not to do so because he was worried that a number of cannabis plants in his possession would be discovered.” Leask took her blue child to Redcliffe Hospital and staff tried CPR for about half an hour but couldn’t save Lili. The court heard Cataldo had inflicted the fatal head injuries on his baby in one savage attack between seven and 10 days before she died. “At no time until well after the child had died were you aware that she had been assaulted or for that matter aware of the extent of the very serious injuries that had been inflicted on her,” Justice Burns said. Lili was left with a fractured skull, brain injuries and bruises but would have likely survived if she had been taken to hospital after being bashed. Had she lived, she probably would have suffered brain damage, Justice Burns said. “At all relevant times… you were an especially vulnerable person and in fear of Cataldo,” Justice Burns told Leask. “You were operating with substantially impaired judgment.” Since Lili’s death, Leask has turned her life around and is studying science at university and has been in a relationship for two years, the court heard. Cataldo, who had also pleaded guilty to manslaughter, is due to be sentenced after reports are obtained from a forensic psychiatrist. Accused schoolgirl rapist tagged on Facebook: AN ELITE private school boy accused of raping… https://t.co/Eo1wQqCx7w — tyyguana (@tyyguana) April 4, 2017  A 15-year-old private school student who is accused of raping an unconscious 15-year-old girl and filing the attack was reportedly tagged on her Facebook profile just two days before his arrest. According to The Daily Telegraph, on the day the allegations against the former Cranbrook student were first reported, another student tagged the accused rapist on the victim’s personal Facebook profile. The tag asked the accused if the girl’s profile belonged to “the one he had been talking about”. The boy was due in Bidura Children’s Court in Glebe yesterday, but has been excused from appearing in court because he now lives interstate. “His parents are overseas for work and unable to transport him or accommodate him in Sydney,” Legal Aid solicitor Aaron Tang told the court. The accused has been charged with aggravated sexual assault after police believe he had sexual relations with a girl at a Bellevue Hill party on March 4. It was reported the girl did not know she had been sexually assaulted until she was alerted via a text message the next day. Doctor describes horror of alleged Syria gas attack that killed dozens: “I’ve never seen anything like it” https://t.co/0JPjhFzXJD pic.twitter.com/YwPpIDIDxY — CNN (@CNN) April 4, 2017  A suspected gas attack, believed to be by Syrian government jets, has killed at least 58 people including 11 children under the age of eight in the northwestern province of Idlib, a war monitor and medical workers in the rebel-held area said. A Syrian military source strongly denied the army had used any such weapons, AAP reports. The attack caused many people to choke or faint, and some had foam coming out of their mouths, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, citing medical sources who described it as a sign of a gas attack. The air strikes on the town of Khan Sheikhoun, in the south of rebel-held Idlib, also wounded more than 60 people, said the Observatory, a British-based war monitoring group. “This morning, at 6.30 am, warplanes targeted Khan Sheikhoun with gases, believed to be sarin and chlorine,” said Mounzer Khalil, head of Idlib’s health authority, adding that the attack had killed more than 50 people and wounded 300. “Most of the hospitals in Idlib province are now overflowing with wounded people,” he told a news conference in Idlib. It would mark the deadliest chemical attack in Syria since sarin gas killed hundreds of civilians in Ghouta near Damascus in August 2013. Western states said the Syrian government was responsible for that attack. Damascus blamed it on rebels. Activists in northern Syria circulated pictures on social media showing a purported victim with foam around his mouth, and rescue workers hosing down almost naked children squirming on the floor. The Russian Defence Ministry said on Tuesday that Russian planes had not carried out air strikes on Idlib. Australian customs intercepts parcel of live snakes, tarantulas and scorpions https://t.co/cvLnIXaIGO — Guardian news (@guardiannews) April 4, 2017  A box marked ‘2 pair shoes’ has contained a scaly surprise for border and biosecurity officers. Officers in Melbourne X-rayed a parcel from northern Europe on March 14, discovering live reptiles and arachnids inside, AAP reports. They included six venomous vipers and two of what is believed to be the world’s third-largest tarantula. Smuggled with the parcel were three ball pythons (also known as royal pythons), two hognose snakes, six vipers, two Colombian giant tarantulas, five Mexican redone tarantulas, two Brazilian salmon pink tarantulas and four Asian forest scorpions. The Agriculture Department’s deputy secretary Lyn O’Connell says it appeared to be a clear attempt to get around the rules which are in place to protect Australians. “No spider is a match for our biosecurity web, we get our tails up when there are scorpions in the mail and if you try send exotic snakes — beware if we find intentional non-compliance, we bite back with the full force of the law,” she said in a statement on Tuesday. The package is being investigated. Woman and child killed in horrific road crash on NSW south coast https://t.co/U7G7S6k9KZ #7News pic.twitter.com/6AOZyROo4h — 7News Yahoo7 (@Y7News) April 4, 2017  A woman and child have been killed in a crash on the Princes Highway on the state’s south coast, while another child is fighting for life. Police say a car with three occupants collided with a semi-trailer north of Berry about 11.45am on Tuesday, AAP reports. The female driver and a child died at the scene, police said. A girl in the vehicle, aged in her early teens, had to be freed from the vehicle and has been airlifted to Sydney’s Prince of Wales Hospital in a critical condition, a NSW Ambulance spokesman said. It’s believed the three occupants of the car are related. The truck driver was not injured in the accident. Police have established a crime scene and investigations are underway. Sydney lifeguard accused of historical sex offences with nippers – The Sydney Morning Herald https://t.co/7OOSD3Vejv pic.twitter.com/EpaNpK1eTo — Sydney Informer (@sydneyinformer) April 4, 2017  A Sydney lifeguard sexually assaulted three nippers at an eastern suburbs surf life saving club and at a nearby Catholic church in the 1980s, a jury has been told. During his opening address in the man’s trial in the NSW District Court on Tuesday, Crown prosecutor Rohan Cooley said he also expected the jury to hear evidence that the man further assaulted another two boys on the grounds of the church between 1982 and 1986, AAP reports. The youngest alleged victim was aged between seven and 10 at the time of the offences, while the oldest was between 12 and 13 years old, Mr Cooley said in the NSW District Court on Tuesday. He said he expected the jury to hear evidence that the man, now 49, raped one of the boys on church grounds, and incited the same boy and his younger cousin to perform oral sex on each other. On another occasion, the accused fondled a nipper’s genitals in a room at the surf life saving club where he was a lifeguard while a St John ambulance officer watched, Mr Cooley said. He is also accused of giving and receiving oral sex, and masturbating in front of at least one boy. The man has pleaded not guilty to 35 charges, including inciting an indecent act, committing an act of indecency on or towards a male under 16, and homosexual intercourse with a male between 10 and 18.

So, I put shorts on just in case,"" he said. “He’s very frisky. He likes to show his love so you want to cover up just that little period of time.” Um. OK?

Here’s what she wants you to know.,"July 25, 2022","Here's what a typical day in the life of award-winning journalist, author, and broadcaster Tracey Spicer looks like: She gets up and meditates for half an hour to get some more oxygen into her blood. She does this in order to stand up and for her body
to move effectively without crashing. Then she'll make herself breakfast and consume about 15 different supplements. This all takes about half an hour because she's moving around in a wheelchair and she has to do things very slowly and deep-breathe before and after, so that she doesn't
impact her body too badly. Then she lies down on the couch and watches TV for about an hour to build up her strength again. Afterwards, she works for an hour on the computer. Then she'll do another meditation session or perhaps take a bath or a shower, which is physically taxing.
After her shower or bath, she'll lie down for another half an hour to recover from it. It will take her about an hour to get lunch ready and she will need to lie down afterwards again. The afternoons are usually when she has medical appointments, so she attends those and then comes home for another lie down and meditation session or some
yin yoga for about 20 minutes. Her husband and kids will make dinner, and they'll all eat together. But having conversations with people is exhausting so she can only do it for about 45 minutes over dinner. Then she'll lie down and watch TV for another two or three hours before going
to sleep. The sleep is not restful, either. It hasn't been for 204 days - Tracey is a sufferer of the dreaded Long COVID.

It was as if an army was marching through my body attacking each organ in
turn. I've really never experienced anything like it."" Listen to Jessie Stephen's full interview with Tracey Spicer on the No Filter podcast below. Story continues below.  For those first two weeks of having COVID, Tracey's symptoms were already pretty severe. ""This will probably resonate with a lot of people who got the Delta strain, which is what I got earlier this year. I lost my taste and smell, I had the coughing, the crippling fatigue,"" she says. ""There was some unusual symptoms as well. I had tinnitus all the time - the ringing ears. Bleeding gums... Very early on, every time I could drag myself out of bed, I got chest pains and palpitations, as if my body was saying no, you've just got to lie
down. ""I also had skin rashes, I had something called ""small fibre neuropathy"", which means you get a feeling like an electric shock in your extremities, and this kept happening to my right foot. It seemed as if it was having a go at different organs one
at a time."" Tracey considered going to the hospital a few times, but ultimately thought that since she was triple-vaxxed, if she just lay down and drank a lot of water and ate vegetables, it would go away. ""I wonder whether this is something that predominantly affects women because traditionally we are the carers in society. I was more worried about passing it on to the teenage kids and I was constantly on the phone and texting them asking, have you got
symptoms, are you okay, I hope I haven't passed it on to you. In a way, I put myself last,"" Tracey says. Prior to getting COVID, Tracey was training for a four-day trek on Cradle Mountain in Tasmania and a 30-day walk through Sydney to raise money for a charity. She was the fittest she'd ever been.  ""That's why it was so weird that I got hit that badly with COVID,"" she explains. ""But I was keen to get back into exercise because of the training regime. However, my body was telling me, go slowly, you just can't do this. Every time I tried to take the
dog even for a five or 10-minute walk, my heart would start racing. So I did a few really gentle walks with the dog and gradually built up to about half an hour with her. ""And then honestly six weeks after I had Covid originally, I tried to do a reformer pilates class, which I've done for about 10 years. And I started feeling like I was having a heart attack - real stabbing pains in the chest. I pulled all the springs
off the reformer machine and just pretended to do the rest of the class with everyone else. And then went home and lay down and thought, oh my goodness, I've done something terrible here. I don't know what I've done. ""That's why I'm pretty vocal about advising people to take it incredibly easy when it comes to exercise because your body's simply not ready for it."" Tracey went through a three-month phase where she saw five different medical people and allied health specialists a week, just trying to pick their brains. ""We're so fortunate to have Medicare and a relatively robust health system here in Australia, but unfortunately, a lot of the research is done overseas, and we are behind when it comes to Long COVID. In fact, one of the first GPs I told about this when
I said I had Long COVID leapt back from me thinking that I was still contagious. I said, no, no, no, you're not gonna catch anything from me, it's long COVID,"" she says. ""I guess I'm very disappointed in the lack of government education campaigns when it comes to the medical profession because, I know they're exhausted; they've been through hell with COVID, but there's so many people who are suffering. I'm talking about
my own situation [here in this podcast], but my heart goes out to younger people who have this, or people who've had longer chronic conditions for decades, because it must be utterly debilitating and frustrating being gaslit by medical professionals
all the time."" Watch: Australian data reveals Long Covid sufferers are often younger, active and female. Story continues below. Ongoing treatment for Long COVID does not come easily either. ""The medical system is set up for either life or death. It's not set up for chronic conditions. So the first thing they do structurally is rule out the most common ailments that cause these symptoms. They will send you off for a chest x-ray, for
lung function test, to see whether there's anything obviously structurally wrong with the heart. But what the latest research is showing with Long COVID is it's creating micro-clots which don't show up on the usual tests,"" Tracey tells No Filter. ""So you've got all these incredibly frustrated people with Long COVID, who are trying to be taken seriously, getting a battery of tests. And if it's exhausting making a cup of tea, I can tell you I went to the other side of the city today for a hospital
appointment, and that completely killed me. You go for all these exhausting tests, and then they find that there's nothing wrong with you or they think there's nothing wrong with you because it's not obvious structurally. ""However, I understand why the medical profession has to rule out some of the more serious, immediately life-threatening conditions... I've managed to find a few really good, progressive forward thinking GPs, who have given me five or six off-label low-dose
medications that have helped about 10 to 20 per cent. And they're things like statins to help stop the chest pain and it has stopped the chest pain. Steroidal anti-inflammatories to give you a little bit of energy to be able to work a couple
of days a week, just the simple things. ""Some of the antidepressants really help not because this is a psychological condition but because there's neurological impacts from Long COVID in your body and they help a little bit as well. But aside from that, some people are talking about cannabis
oil and low dose Naltrexone. I haven't tried those, but really anything you can be given is relatively experimental. However, when you feel like this, honestly, you'll try anything."" A post shared by Tracey Spicer AM (@traceyspicer) As someone who has worked hard all her life, and who has a very enriching career, the neurological impact has been particularly intrusive. ""I got some really good advice from a colleague of mine - Sophie Scott, the health reporter for the ABC, she has been an absolute lifeline. She was talking about how you've really got to stimulate your vagus nerve and rest before and after you work to
help with the flow of the blood to the brain cognitively,"" Tracey advises. ""So let me give you a very real world example of this. Yesterday, I had to undergo a battery of tests. And because I was standing up more than usual, the executive function of my brain was impacted and I did the most stupid things around the house. The
porridge overflowed in the morning and I almost wrecked the whole kitchen bench. I left our garage door open. When I drove out of the house - I'm not driving very much it tends to really cognitively wreck me - for four hours! Anyone could have come
in and robbed the whole house. I called one of our children the wrong name! ""This is the kind of cognitive stuff that happens. So then I actively did lots of meditation. Last night, I had a massive sleep, look non-refreshing sleep, but still had a massive sleep, and more meditation this morning. And that filled my cup enough
to be able to write one chapter of my book this morning. So what you've got to do is focus on lying down and resting as much as possible before you have to do anything cognitively to refill that cup."" Speaking of cups, Tracey recounted what happened when she had a glass of wine with dinner recently, against her better judgement. She hadn't been drinking alcohol for the past six months because she'd been feeling so terrible, but since it was a special
occasion, she decided a small glass of rose with her salmon couldn't hurt. She was very wrong. ""The next thing I remember, it's three o'clock in the morning, I've got a very sore head, and my husband is looming over me in the bathroom, saying, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, are you all right?"" Tracey says. ""What had happened was I got up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. And I didn't realise that I have a very common manifestation of Long COVID called POTS, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, which means when you go from lying to
sitting or sitting to standing, or worst-case scenario, lying to standing, your blood pools in your legs and goes from your brain. Your brain forgets to tell your body to stand up and you just pass out and can crack your head. ""And that's what happened to me. It's seen by some cardiologists as one of the less serious heart conditions you can have. But you can actually die if you pass out and hit your head, and my husband found me pale and unresponsive on the floor. He said
it took a good five minutes to get me to come to and he seriously thought I was dead. So it was a very, very scary moment."" Tracey is afraid that we will have new generations of people living with disabilities if nothing is done about Long Covid. ""We will have enormous labour shortages in the next couple of years. And we will have an overwhelmed health system where people simply cannot cope. I mean, look at what's happening in the health system now. There are so many people with Covid at the moment
and they can't get enough staff,"" she says. ""And then you've got this extra layer of Long COVID and people living with chronic disease. This will have an enormous impact on our society in the next three to five years if nothing is done."" A post shared by Tracey Spicer AM (@traceyspicer) For those who think they might have Long COVID or who are in the aftermath and don't know what to do and where to start looking for help, Tracey has some sage advice. ""If you've had COVID and you feel like you might have recovered a little bit in the weeks or month after, that's fantastic. But keep an eye out after that for any of these signs: any unexplained chest pain or palpitations whether standing up or lying
down, any unusual feeling of sickness or exhaustion, and they call it fatigue but it's more than tiredness. You actually feel cold-y and flu-y again, and you think you're coming down with something. But it's the old COVID symptoms coming back as part
of Long COVID,"" she says. ""So whatever you had the first time, keep an eye out for that coming back because it's more than tiredness, it's sickness. Keep an eye out for tinnitus, the ringing in the ears. Also, sinusitis and rhinitis, so anything like hay fever symptoms, that can
be your Long COVID feeling like it's coming back again. So they're the main thing. ""The other unusual symptom I had early on in my Long COVID journey was cystitis, because the organs that are affected certainly your lungs, everyone knows that your heart, your kidneys are really badly affected as well. So if you have anything that
affects your kidneys, or your digestive system, any of your allergies start playing up again, you feel like you might start being allergic to gluten or sugar or something you were never allergic to before, that's mast cell activation syndrome,
and that's part of Long COVID. So anything unusual, really keep an eye out for it."" Tracey advises doing some research on the Long COVID Facebook pages - one of the pages has started up a list of GPs who understand Long COVID around Australia. ""Find yourself a good GP who understands it. Try to get yourself to a Long COVID clinic; often people drop out at the last minute and you might not have to wait a long time,"" Tracey tells No Filter.  ""Just get the help you need and understand that you're not alone. There are people who want to help you and support you. We're here for you."" For more No Filter episodes, go to mamamia.com.au/podcasts/no-filter. Feature image: Instagram.

Should a government that goes to the polls with a policy of a plebiscite on same sex marriage keep its promise to the voters or break it? The government just did walk away from a policy it took to the election - on superannuation. At the behest of members of it's own backbench too. That's right they broke their superannuation committment they took to an election because of members of their own party - But nobody cares because the policy was about retirement for wealthy Australians and not the fundamental rights of minorities.  Yes they did and they are wrong to break a promise. They shouldn't compound it by breaking any more. Should cannabis be legalised for medicinal and recreational use.","Sep 15, 2016 ...

https://www.mamamia.com.au/illegal-drugs-once-used-for-medical-purposes/,The illegal drugs we once used to use for sore throats and teething.,"July 12, 2015","Ahh, the good old days. Mum could just give the kids a bit of cocaine to soothe a toothache, or a teensy bit of heroin to tend to a sore throat. Not all that long ago, people were actively encouraged to cure or soothe their ailments with some of the most hardcore, illegal drugs of our time. At one point in time, heroin was actually thought to help ween people from their addictions. Which would be funny if it weren’t so dangerous. LIKE Debrief Daily on Facebook.  The use of these drugs back then is a bit like asbestos. Once upon a time, it was fine to use this insidious and poisonous building material in and around most Australian homes. Now? Well, now we find out it can kill you. These deliciously wrong advertisements of yesteryear show what a difference hindsight (and bloody good science) makes. Remember when they put cocaine in Coca-Cola? Maybe not, but in 1903, Coca-Cola was forced to remove the party drug as an ingredient. It was finally banned entirely in 1920. Cocaine was originally intended as a patent medicine when it was invented in 1886 by John Pemberton. He used five ounces of coca leaf (141.7 g) per gallon of syrup in the first five years, but the company was bought by businessman Asa Griggs Candler in 1891, who claimed his formula contained only 0.5 ounces. (14.2 g). Either way, as we know today, it is a nothing more than a highly addictive and illegal recreational drug. This elixir was compounded by Mrs. Charlotte N. Winslow and first marketed by her son-in-law Jeremiah Curtis and Benjamin A. Perkins in Bangor, Maine in 1849. It contained 65 mg of morphine. Dr Seth Arnold's Cough Killer, which contained morphine, from the late 1800s was claimed to cure coughs, asthma, pneumonia, malaria and many other diseases. Sure, the kids weren't coughing any more. But it was because they were OFF THEIR FACES. Heroin seemingly cured EVERYTHING. Heroin was originally designed as a medicine to relieve symptoms affecting the chest and lungs. In short, it was a cough medicine. The name is derived from the word “heroisch,” meaning heroic, which was used at the time to describe a strong medicine. Because heroin passes directly from the blood to the brain, it is a faster acting painkiller than morphine. It was praised in early trials and quickly adopted as a medicine in several countries. It was effective in treating a cough and helping patients sleep, and there didn't seem to be any adverse effects. In fact, patients seemed to like it. Funny that! According to Narconon, the first record of marijuana use dates back to a medical handbook from China in 2737 BC. It spread across Asia and Africa and reached Europe around 500 AD. Throughout its spread, it was used medicinally to treat gout, rheumatism, malaria, and absent-mindedness. It became popular as an alternative to alcohol for recreational use in the Muslim world because alcohol was forbidden by the Quran. Whilst wine isn't illegal, it certainly isn't prescribed by doctors these days for influenza. Well, not by any doctor I've ever seen anyway. Although I'd like to. Amphetamine was successfully marketed as the first antidepressant in the late 1930s and 1940s. While amphetamines in general were first synthesised in 1887, the methamphetamine variant was created in 1919 to counteract fatigue. Following the timeline published by healthvermont.gov, methamphetamine started being used by doctors in the US in the 1930s as a treatment for asthma and narcolepsy. Well, it certainly keeps you awake ... Rohypnol is a benzodiazepine, which is a type of sedative-hypnotic prescribed for anxiety, sleep disorders, and seizures. It's the same type of drug as Xanax, Librium, Atavan, and Valium. The reason Rohypnol isn't legal is because it's 10 times as potent as Valium, which is already pretty strictly controlled. At one point in history, it was an easily accessible drug used to calm the nerves. The advert above showing a particularly heinous example of this. Times have certainly changed haven't they?
