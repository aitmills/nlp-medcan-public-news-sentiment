For Doctor Doctor actors Rodger Corser and Kate Jenkinson, playing medical professionals means they also have to look like they know how to perform surgery. According to Kate — who plays Tara on the drama — that's tougher than it looks because of the costume involved. ""Doing operations on set it's actually really tricky because you've got the full kit on, you've got the face mask, you've got a hair [piece], glasses, so you really feel like a bit of a Power Ranger,"" she explained to 9Entertainment. ""It's a whole new skill set because you have to look proficient at something you've never done before in your lifetime."" In the Episode 2 plot, Hugh (Rodger Corser) had not long been fired from his job at Whyhope hospital when Penny (Hayley McElhinney) and Tara needed him back to perform heart surgery on a man who pierced his heart in an accident. Unfortunately when they call Hugh he is high after smoking cannabis. ""Hugh's eating cream biscuits because he's got the munchies in the kitchen after going out ruining the five paddocks he was plowing and is forced to come in and help them, but he has to hide the fact he can't see straight,"" Rodger said. To prevent his boss Penny finding out Hugh instead makes the operation a ""teaching opportunity"" for Tara. ""Fortunately she'd never done the procedure before so it was OK that I looked like I didn't know what I was doing,"" Kate added. ""So stoned Hugh, who is supposed to be her mentor, is guiding her poorly through this procedure, but thankfully she doesn't stuff it up."" And just like that Hugh has his job back in the hospital, but all is not right with his world if a preview of next week's episode is anything to go by. Dinah, the mother of Hugh's ex Harriet, shows up in town with dubious intentions for her granddaughter Eliza.
