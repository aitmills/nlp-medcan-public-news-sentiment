For Doctor Doctor actors Rodger Corser and Kate Jenkinson, playing medical professionals means they also have to look like they know how to perform surgery. According to Kate — who plays Tara on the drama — that's tougher than it looks because of the costume involved. ""Doing operations on set it's actually really tricky because you've got the full kit on, you've got the face mask, you've got a hair [piece], glasses, so you really feel like a bit of a Power Ranger,"" she explained to 9Entertainment. ""It's a whole new skill set because you have to look proficient at something you've never done before in your lifetime."" In the Episode 2 plot, Hugh (Rodger Corser) had not long been fired from his job at Whyhope hospital when Penny (Hayley McElhinney) and Tara needed him back to perform heart surgery on a man who pierced his heart in an accident. Unfortunately when they call Hugh he is high after smoking cannabis. ""Hugh's eating cream biscuits because he's got the munchies in the kitchen after going out ruining the five paddocks he was plowing and is forced to come in and help them, but he has to hide the fact he can't see straight,"" Rodger said. To prevent his boss Penny finding out Hugh instead makes the operation a ""teaching opportunity"" for Tara. ""Fortunately she'd never done the procedure before so it was OK that I looked like I didn't know what I was doing,"" Kate added. ""So stoned Hugh, who is supposed to be her mentor, is guiding her poorly through this procedure, but thankfully she doesn't stuff it up."" And just like that Hugh has his job back in the hospital, but all is not right with his world if a preview of next week's episode is anything to go by. Dinah, the mother of Hugh's ex Harriet, shows up in town with dubious intentions for her granddaughter Eliza.

What a milestone. As you farewell the end of the week (and the end of the month — already!), we've selected three shows dropping on streaming services to watch to help you wind down from the week that was. RELATED: Jamie Dornan announced as lead of new Stan Original series The Tourist What: The sitcoms of the '90s were a breed of television like no other — Friends, Seinfeld, Frasier, Full House, Family Matters just to name a few. But there was a sitcom in the '90s that really was well ahead of its time, Dinosaurs. Like the shows before it (including the stone age animation The Flintstones), Dinosaurs tells the story of the Sinclairs, a normal working class family living in the prehistoric era. If that doesn't sound strange enough, the Sinclair family (and every character in the show) are life-sized puppets, designed by Jim Henson. The show is funny and well ahead of its time, dealing with issues like environmentalism, women's rights, sexual harassment and LGBTIQ+ rights. The show features voices of Stuart Pankin (Curb Your Enthusiasm) and Jessica Walter (Arrested Development). If you want a fun romp back into different era of television, Dinosaurs might be just the show for you. When: All four seasons drop on Friday. Where: Disney+. What: Set in the Melbourne CBD, Canal Road follows a medical and legal advisory centre (also known as Canal Road) where the lives of inner-city professionals and their patients entwine in a story of mystery, scandal and intrigue. Our lead character is Spencer MacKay (Paul Leyden), a psychiatrist who is confronted by the killer of his loved ones. Spencer sets out on a journey of revenge that will implicate friends, workmates and his darkest demons. Compelling stuff. The show features an A-list rollcall of Australian actors including Leyden, Diana Glenn, Brooke Satchwell, Patrick Brammall, Peta Sergeant, Charlie Clausen, Sibylla Budd and Grant Bowler. The series lasted for a season of 13 episodes, so if you're looking for a locally made drama you can whizz through in a weekend, Canal Road is the place you'll want to be. When: Stream now. Where: 9Now. What: Magician, illusionist and escape artist Harry Houdini lived a legendary career. Houdini, now streaming on Stan, chronicles the life of a man who can defy death through stunts, visions and the mastery of illusion. The miniseries follows Houdini behind the magic as he finds fame, engages in espionage, and battles the greatest and most dangerous spiritualists of the era. Adrien Brody portrays Houdini, who starts out performing card tricks at sideshows at a travelling circus with his wife Bess (Kristen Connolly). His career soon takes off on the American vaudeville circuit as a master illusionist before eventually achieving international fame as an escape artist, performing for the likes of royalty and celebrities. Full of magic and fear, Houdini is a treat to watch. When: The two-part series is streaming now. Where: Stan.
